       "[['What Would Happen if the U.S. was Nuked?',\n",
       "  'Ever wonder what would happen if the U.S. was nuked? While there are numerous factors to take into consideration in the event of a nuclear war on U.S. soil, we’ve done our best to answer some of the most commonly asked questions, in the simplest and most understandable of terms.\\nWhich Areas Would be Hit, and How Far Would the Fallout Reach? On the topic of which regions of the U.S. would be hit; part of it is left up to guess work, as we are unable to fully predict the aggressing nation’s tactics, but then much of it is also based on logic. For example, any nation that strikes the U.S. will want to disable their nukes, so we can easily surmise that areas such as North Dakota would be obliterated.\\nActive nuclear energy plants would also make good targets, as the added nuclear energy from the reactors would maximize destruction. And then of course, there are the major government facilities that would be targeted, at least, those that are known of – unfortunately, it’s safe to assume an aggressing nation’s intelligence would have a better idea of the U.S. government’s “soft spots” than the average American citizen.\\nBefore we get too far ahead of ourselves, however, let’s go with what we know; what kind of targets would the U.S. go for? In the case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, numerous military personnel, politicians, and now historians claim that the first bomb was dropped to prove it could be done, and the second bomb was dropped to display the United States’ strength to Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union, who was originally aligned with the U.S. and Britain during WWII, but who the U.S. knew would become a problem once the war was over, (Foner, 2014, p. 887-949).\\nWhile we are aware there are numerous citizens who, to this day, refuse to believe any other version of events than the original government narrative, the point is, we can’t use the cases of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as an accurate indicator of the type of targets the U.S. would choose. Fortunately though, we do have a detailed list of targets the U.S. created in 1956 – in the event of war with the Soviet Union – that was released through the National Archives and Records Administration . The list includes major cities for “ systematic destruction ,” including areas that contain “ Agricultural Equipment ” and “ Transformers, Heavy .” Most horridly though, was a target simply titled “ Population .”\\nYep. The almighty, all wise, glorious, wholesome and righteous, baseball-loving, apple pie-eating, land of the free, and home of the brave, planned to target large populations of innocent civilians, and it’s with that in mind we can surmise that largely populated areas would be potential targets here in the States, as well.\\nProvided below are two maps created by FEMA, the first of which is from 1990, and shows the presumed targets the Soviets would have hit in the event of a nuclear attack. “Fallout,” according to the University of Notre Dame , is described as the mixture of earth and/or water that has entered the rising fireball caused from the detonation of a nuclear bomb near the Earth’s surface. This mixes with the radioactive debris of the explosion at an early stage, and is then blown into the troposphere and lower stratosphere, creating fallout. The most lethal fallout is indicated by the darkest coloration, while the lesser lethal fallout is indicated with yellow:\\nSource: FEMA\\nIn this map, FEMA shows a sample fallout pattern we could expect in a nuclear attack:\\nSource: FEMA\\nHow Long Would the Fallout Last? After being blown into the troposphere and lower stratosphere, “ the material is then re-distributed over polar (3-12 months) or equatorial regions (8-24 months). Fall-out removal times (defined in terms of half-life) ranges from 10 to 24 months depending upon seasonal conditions, most rapid during spring, slow in summer ,” again, this is according to the University of Notre Dame, (source above).\\nWhere Would Government Officials and the “Elite” Go in the Event of a Nuclear Attack?'],\n",

through Tal Afar region to Raqqa in Syria is also impossible given the massive presence of Hashd al-Sha’abi (popular forces) in the Southern front near Be’aaj district, Northwest of the Iraqi province

       "  \"Getty - Jemall Countess/Stringer The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \\nMegyn Kelly is a bit of a hot commodity nowadays, though one might not be able to tell that from the ire she is drawing from Trump fans. \\nThe Week, and other publications, kicked up a media frenzy this summer by speculating that Megyn Kelly was leaving Fox News, much to the delight of her Trump-supporting detractors: \\nMegyn Kelly's contract at Fox News will expire after the election, and the star anchor has publicly confessed that she doesn't know what's going to happen after that. “I've had a great 12 years here, and I really like working for Roger Ailes. I really like my show, and I love my team. But, you know, there's a lot of brain damage that comes from the job,” she told Variety this spring. Image Credit: Mike Coppola/Getty Images for People.com \\nIn an “exclusive” report from Breitbart, the bigwigs at the network were purportedly forming an alliance to “block” her, and in an eye-opening bit of potential foreshadowing for TrumpTV , the website wrote: \\nAt least one top talent inside Fox News has confirmed to Breitbart News that a major talent meeting among various different hosts is scheduled, and they are considering leaving with Roger Ailes to form a new network to compete with Fox. \\n“Everyone here hates Gretchen and Megyn,” the anonymous source reportedly told the website. Gretchen Carlson would later leave Fox News . \\nOf course, Roger Ailes was to be forced out after he was blitzed by sexual harassment accusations from a number of female employees, including a claim by Megyn Kelly. New York Magazine reported : \\nAccording to two sources briefed on parent company 21st Century Fox’s outside probe of the Fox News executive, led by New York–based law firm Paul, Weiss, Kelly has told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. Kelly, according to the sources, has described her harassment by Ailes in detail. Image Credit: Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images \\nAiles would find safe harbor with the Trump campaign , whose presidential nominee Donald Trump later found himself under siege from sexual assault accusations . Recently, Vanity Fair published a story that the two media potentates had a “ falling out .” \\nIn August, Fox News appointed two executives to attempt filling Ailes' shoes: Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, who were named as co-presidents. Due to a colossal media merger of AT&T and Time Warner, CNN executive Jeff Zucker is believed by some to have the inside track on taking over at Fox News. The Hollywood Reporter writes : \\nCNN’s Jeff Zucker who, having worked for GE when he ran NBC, might be considered a more logical bridge to AT&T and, if rebuffed, might likely be open to the Murdoch sons' interest in having him come to run Fox News. \\nThe Murdoch brothers are not believed to share their father's conservative sensibilities, and thus there are concerns that the two would reshape the network into a much less conservative one. Image Credit: Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images \\nWith Sean Hannity riding high as a conservative pundit on the strength of his vocal Trump support, his ratings have even eclipsed Kelly's... at least for now. There is a strong belief by many that the host's unwavering support is an audition for TrumpTV, should The Donald lose the election. \\nIt's in this tumultuous environment — filled with intrigue at the network and turmoil across the media landscape — that Megyn Kelly's future has become uncertain. A leaked discussion of her contract negotiations sheds more light. \\nAs reported by Politico: \\nContract negotiations between Megyn Kelly and Fox News Channel have spilled into the media, with Fox News interim CEO Rupert Murdoch talking on the record to The Wall Street Journal (which he also owns via his other company, News Corp.) about the matter. \\nAccording to the Journal's Joe Flint, “Mr. Murdoch said in an interview that she is important to the network and he hopes to get a contract signed 'very soon,' but noted, 'it’s up to her.'” \\nThen Murdoch hinted, not unsubtly, “We have a deep bench of talent, many of whom would give their right arm for her spot.” \\nAs noted by the publication, Kelly is shopping around her talents as well, booking an expected appearance as co-host of ABC's “Live with Kelly!” Image Credit: Paul Morigi/Getty Images \\nMegyn Kelly is also seeking a more lucrative contract: \\nFlint reports that Kelly, who will make around $15 million this year, is aiming to get north of $20 million per year with her new contract. He also said he wants to keep Bill O'Reilly on as the channel's 8 PM host. O'Reilly's contract is also up next year. \\nMurdoch also attempted to put rumors of a less conservative Fox News outlet to rest in the Wall Street Journal interview: \\n“We’re not changing direction…that would be business suicide.” \\nIf TrumpTV indeed becomes a reality, the winds of change may shift again. Fox News will have a very different look — with or without Megyn Kelly — as a feud looms over who is the real “conservative” leader in cable news. \"],\n",
       " ['The Tomb of Jesus Revealed',\n",
       "  'It has been 1,700 years since Emperor Constantine built the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where the tomb of Jesus was revealed. The emperor believed Joseph of Arimathea placed the body of Jesus inside the church, according to CBN News.\\nWorkmen, under the watchful eye of The National Geographic, have gently removed the marble slab that laid on top of the tomb. This heavy piece of marble has laid on the tomb of Jesus since 1555 A.D. Fredrik Hiebert, a National Geographic archeologist-in-residence, said he was profoundly astonished by the find.\\nThe Tomb of Jesus Hours of examination of the tomb of Jesus led the team of researchers to announce their revelations. Hiebert says, they are not 100 percent sure, but it appears the location of the tomb has not shifted. He also said that scientists and historians have wondered this for decades.\\nThe tomb of Jesus revealed a layer of fill material. After hours of labor, workers exposed an entirely different marble slab with a cross carved into it. Workers also found, in the tomb of Jesus, three crosses and some iron nails. After high anticipation, of those watching, they finally uncovered what they believe is the original limestone burial bed of Christ .\\nChristian tradition states that the body of Jesus Christ laid on a shelf, or burial bed, carved into the side of a limestone cave. This happened after the Romans crucified him, around 30-33 A.D. According to Christian faith, Jesus was resurrected after his death. As the story goes, a woman who went to anoint Jesus’ body, three days after he was buried, said there were no remains in the tomb.\\nIn the Gospel of John, 19:38-42, it is written that Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus, asked Pilate if he could take the body of Jesus away. He was given permission and took Jesus’ body.\\nNicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes. He brought about 100 pounds of them. They both took the body of Jesus and bound him in linen covered in spices; this was a custom of the Jews. A garden grew in the place where he was crucified. The tomb sat in the garden no one had yet laid in. This is where John and Nicodemus placed the body of Jesus Christ.\\nRestoring the Tomb\\nScientists from the National Technical University of Athens are trying to repair a structure that protects the tomb of Jesus called Edicule. This is from the Latin word, aedicule that means little house . The last dated work to the structure was between 1808-10.\\nIn the 19th-century, Edicule suffered structural integrity, from an earthquake, in 1927. The building was shored up, in 1947, by the British authorities. Lack of financial resources and difficulties had put a stop to the repairs.\\nAntonia Moropoulou, the leader of the restoration project, said they will have to remove the marble and stone slabs. She went on to say they will also inject grout into them. This process will homogenize the complex structure.\\nPeople working on the project say that it is more than just a job. Vasyleyos Zafeylys, a Greek civil engineer, says he is a Christian Orthodox. He also said, he has worked on projects like this, but this is a special one. He believes he cannot go to another project that will be bigger and better than this one. Moropoulou said, it is a collaborative effort, but everyone near the archeological find feels the value of the holy tomb giving the resurrection message.\\nThe churches’ communities agreed to restore the church, in March of 2016. Completion of Edicule is scheduled for spring of 2017. The $4 million-plus project has major backers such as royal benefactors from King Abdullah II of Jordan. Mica Ertegun gifted $1.3 million to the World Monument Fund in support of the endeavor.\\nBy Tracy Blake\\nEdited by Jeanette Smith\\nSources:\\nCBN News: What Researchers Found in the Tomb of Jesus\\nLive Science: Original Bedrock of Jesus’ Tomb Revealed in New Images\\nNational Geographic: Exclusive: Christ’s Burial Place Exposed for First Time in Centuries\\nImage Courtesy of Seetheholyland.net’s Flickr Page – Creative Commons License\\nInline Image Courtesy of Ft Lawrence, Lew O.P.’s Flickr Page – Creative Common License spot , Tomb of Jesus'],\n",

       "  'on October 25, 2016 10:41 pm · \\nNew video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. \\nAs part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. \\nIn the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him “I don’t rent to the n-word,” and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. \\nThe revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump’s run-in with the federal government over discrimination. \\nUndercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. \\nOne bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a “C” on the documents for “colored,” and that was a sign that they should be denied. \\nThe Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. \\nDonald Trump’s involvement with his father’s business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father’s $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization’s history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away – it’s still there. \\nFeatured image via screen capture Share this Article!

       " [\"Clinton Vs. Trump: Latest Electoral Prediction [Greg Laden's Blog] | Science and Technology\",\n",
       "  \"(Before It's News)\\nIt is fun to look at polls, and using such data, decide which candidate will win which state, and ultimately, which candidate will win the electoral college. A lot of people and organizations do that, and for this reason, I don’t. I do not have access to polls that no one else sees. Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state, I’d use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight, and probably come up with similar results. How boring. It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team.\\nBack during the Democratic Primaries, I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win, fairly early on. The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn’t have polling data that early in the process. So, I invented an alternative method, which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote. That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes, outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight.\\nAfter a while, enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly. Using the same exact model, but primed with the results of prior primaries (that year) rather than my estimates of voter behavior, I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests.\\nOnce again, my method was very accurate, and once again, it out performed the polling based methods.\\nSo, recently, I’ve tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year’s presidential race. But, it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day. I can’t use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states.\\nI recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level. Things happen during an election season that probably change people’s likely voting behavior, especially among independents. Solid states are rarely polled, and small states, swing or not, are rarely polled. Many polls are of low quality. Right now, for instance, fewer than half of the states have polls that were a) taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b) have an A- or better rating from FiveThirtyEight. If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls, and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate, but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other (and thus likely to not move anyway), I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data. Interestingly, states with some of the more controversial changes happening, like Utah and Iowa, are not adequately polled.\\nIn order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election, I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model (to calculate the regression coefficients) in order to then, separately, predict the likely voting behavior (Trump vs. Clinton) in all of the states.\\nBefore I show you the map, however, I need to discuss something else.\\nAbout a week ago the press, especially the somewhat more left leaning press, and various commenters, seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump’s tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate, events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations, collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread, an electoral rout, and a big party.\\nSoon after, I pointed out that this may not be correct. That polling data seemed to show, rather, that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a re-closing of the gap, with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift. To this I added a concern. If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range, perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect, or a funding effect, that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump.\\nI was not alone in thinking this, and I was probably right. The GOP sunk, via pacs, 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate, which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states, presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread. Indeed, some who criticized (arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes) my admonition noted, correctly, that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of right-leaning polls had come out all at once. This is true, but it ignores that a bunch of left-leaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was.\\nI say all this as part one of my preparation for what I’m going to tell you below, which is not the news you want to hear. Part two is some logic I’d like to bludgeon you with.\\nConsider these points:\\n1) True Trump supporters could give a rat’s ass about sexual assault, poor debate performance, or tax forms. Donald Trump was correct when he said, weeks ago, now forgotten, that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base. These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault. If anything, they were energized by it. And, I’m talking about something just shy of 40% of the voters. We live in a barely civilized asshole country.\\n2) Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters, who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along, are NOW going to pick Clinton (if polled or on voting day) that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters? In other words (this is a somewhat subtle point) which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing? Almost none. They were already there.\\n3) The third category of people, the undecideds (who are only lying about being undecided, in most cases) and the so-called “reasonable Republicans” (of which there are very, very few), who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson, a write in (as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases) or simply staying home.\\nIn other words, over the last few weeks, no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago, and Trump is not going to have any, or at least not many, electoral votes go away.\\nThose observations (part one) and that logic (part two) cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead. In fact, the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago. The difference is in Ohio (shifting from Clinton to Trump) which is almost certainly going to happen, and North Carolina (which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis) which seems much less likely to happen, and Arizona shifting from Clinton (that was probably wishful thinking) to Trump.\\nThe point here is this, plain and simple. An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state. In other words, not different. Maybe a little worse. Really, about the same.\\nHere’s the current map:\\nObviously, I will be watching for more data over the next few days. I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th (the day Democrats vote. Republicans vote on the 28th of November). If so, then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation, and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time.\\nBut between now and then, perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states.\\nBy the way, the “swing states” according to my model, the states where things are close, are Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia of those now in the Trump column. Those are indeed swing states. Numerically, the close states that are in the Clinton column are Virginia, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.\"],\n",

It\\x92s because Clinton doesn\\x92t think that these interventions went wrong. And neither do any of the other members of the US foreign policy establishment. (aka\\x96The Borg). In fact, in their eyes these wars have been a rousing success. Sure, a few have been critical of the public relations backlash from the nonexistent WMD in Iraq, (or the logistical errors, like disbanding the Iraqi Army) but\\x96for the most part\\x96 the foreign policy establishment is satisfied with its efforts to destabilize the region and remove leaders that refuse to follow Washington\\x92s diktats.\\nThis is hard for ordinary people to understand. They can\\x92t grasp why elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning, stable countries into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists, sectarian death squads and foreign-born terrorists. Nor can they understand what has been gained by Washington\\x92s 15 year-long rampage across the Middle East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? What is the purpose of all this?\\nFirst, we have to acknowledge that the decimation and de facto balkanization of these countries is part of a plan. If it wasn\\x92t part of a plan, than the decision-makers would change the policy. But they haven\\x92t changed the policy. The policy is the same. The fact that the US is using foreign-born jihadists to pursue regime change in Syria as opposed to US troops in Iraq, is not a fundamental change in the policy. The ultimate goal is still the decimation of the state and the elimination of the existing government. This same rule applies to Libya and Afghanistan both of which have been plunged into chaos by Washington\\x92s actions.\\nBut why? What is gained by destroying these countries and generating so much suffering and death?\\nHere\\x92s what I think: I think Washington is involved in a grand project to remake the world in a way that better meets the needs of its elite constituents, the international banks and multinational corporations. Brzezinski not only refers to this in the opening Quote: , he also explains what is taking place: The nation-state is being jettisoned as the foundation upon which the global order rests. Instead, Washington is erasing borders, liquidating states, and removing strong, secular leaders that can mount resistance to its machinations in order to impose an entirely new model on the region, a new world order. The people who run these elite institutions want to create an interconnected-global free trade zone overseen by the proconsuls of Big Capital, in other words, a global Eurozone that precludes the required state institutions (like a centralized treasury, mutual debt, federal transfers) that would allow the borderless entity to function properly.\\nDeep state powerbrokers who set policy behind the smokescreen of our bought-and-paid-for congress think that one world government is an achievable goal provided they control the world\\x92s energy supplies, the world\\x92s reserve currency and become the dominant player in this century\\x92s most populous and prosperous region, Asia. This is essentially what Hillary\\x92s \\x93pivot\\x94 to Asia is all about.\\nThe basic problem with Washington\\x92s NWO plan is that a growing number of powerful countries are still attached to the old world order and are now prepared to defend it. This is what\\x92s really going on in Syria, the improbable alliance of Russia, Syria, Iran and Hezbollah have stopped the US military juggernaut dead in its tracks. The unstoppable force has hit the immovable object and the immovable object has prevailed so far.\\nNaturally, the foreign policy establishment is upset about these new developments, and for good reason. The US has run the world for quite a while now, so the rolling back of US policy in Syria is as much a surprise as it is a threat. The Russian Airforce deployed to Syria a full year ago in September, but only recently has Washington shown that it\\x92s prepared to respond by increasing its support of its jihadists agents on the ground and by mounting an attack on ISIS in the eastern part of the country, Raqqa. But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton becomes president in 2017. That\\x92s when the US will directly engage Russia militarily, assuming that their tit-for-tat encounters will be contained within Syria\\x92s borders. It\\x92s a risky plan, but it\\x92s the next logical step in this bloody fiasco. Neither party wants a nuclear war, but Washington believes that doing nothing is tantamount to backing down, therefore, Hillary and her neocon advisors can be counted on to up the ante. \\x93No-fly zone\\x94, anyone?\\nThe assumption is that eventually, and with enough pressure, Putin will throw in the towel. But this is another miscalculation. Putin is not in Syria because he wants to be nor is he there because he values his friendship with Syrian President Bashar al Assad. That\\x92s not it at all. Putin is in Syria because he has no choice. Russia\\x92s national security is at stake. If Washington\\x92s strategy of deploying terrorists to topple Assad succeeds, then the same ploy will be attempted in Iran and Russia. Putin knows this, just like he knows that the scourge of foreign-backed terrorism can decimate entire regions like Chechnya. He knows that it\\x92s better for him to kill these extremists in Aleppo than it will be in Moscow. So he can\\x92t back down, that\\x92s not an option.\\nBut, by the same token, he can compromise, in other words, his goals and the goals of Assad do not perfectly coincide. For example, he could very well make territorial concessions to the US for the sake of peace that Assad might not support.\\nBut why would he do that? Why wouldn\\x92t he continue to fight until every inch of Syria\\x92s sovereign territory is recovered?\\nBecause it\\x92s not in Russia\\x92s national interest to do so, that\\x92s why. Putin has never tried to conceal the fact that he\\x92s in Syria to protect Russia\\x92s national security. That\\x92s his main objective. But he\\x92s not an idealist, he\\x92s a pragmatist who\\x92ll do whatever he has to to end the war ASAP. That means compromise.\\nThis doesn\\x92t matter to the Washington warlords .yet. But it will eventually. Eventually there will be an accommodation of some sort. No one is going to get everything they want, that much is certain. For example, it\\x92s impossible to imagine that Putin would launch a war on Turkey to recover the territory that Turkish troops now occupy in N Syria. In fact, Putin may have already conceded as much to Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan in their recent meetings. But that doesn\\x92t mean that Putin doesn\\x92t have his red lines. He does. Aleppo is a red line. Turkish troops will not be allowed to enter Aleppo.\\nThe western corridor, the industrial and population centers are all red lines. On these, there will be no compromise. Putin will help Assad remain in power and keep the country largely intact. But will Turkey control sections in the north, and will the US control sections in the east?\\nProbably. This will have to be worked out in negotiations, but its unlikely that the country\\x92s borders will be the same as they were before the war broke out. Putin will undoubtedly settle for a halfloaf provided the fighting ends and security is restored. In any event, he\\x92s not going to hang around until the last dog is hung.\\nUnfortunately, we\\x92re a long way from any settlement in Syria, mainly because Washington is nowhere near accepting the fact that its project to rule the world has been derailed. That\\x92s the crux of the matter, isn\\x92t it? The bigshots who run the country are still in denial. It hasn\\x92t sunk in yet that the war is lost and that their nutty jihadist-militia plan has failed.\\nIt\\x92s going to take a long time before Washington gets the message that the world is no longer its oyster. The sooner they figure it out, the better it\\x92ll be for everyone. Mike Whitney lives in Washington state. He is a contributor to Hopeless: Barack Obama and the Politics of Illusion (AK Press).

       "  'A man protests against international trade agreements TTIP and CETA in front of EU headquarters in Brussels on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016.\\nThe Canadian government raised concerns over the European Union’s regulations on chemicals on more than 20 occasions over the course of a decade, according to a letter seen by Energydesk .\\nIn a note sent to the Belgian government on October 19 , the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) claims that the Canadian state challenged the EU’s REACH regulations at the World Trade Organisation 21 times between the years 2003 and 2011.\\nThe UK’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) describes the REACH regulations as providing “a high level of protection of human health and the environment from the use of chemicals.”\\nThe news will raise concerns that Canadian companies may use the trade and investment deal CETA to undermine EU regulations.\\n“The threat of undue Canadian influence on environmental regulations such as REACH is real,” CIEL CEO Carroll Muffett wrote .\\nThe CETA deal – which sets up private courts that enable foreign corporations to sue countries – has been held up by the British government as a model for post-Brexit free trade deals.\\nCorporate courts Canadian companies have also used the trade agreements to take legal action against countries on 42 occasions, according to data from the Investment Policy Hub — with Canada ranked 5th among the nations in which this type of investor-to-state lawsuit have been filed.\\nEarlier this year, for example, the Canadian pipeline company TransCanada sued the United States government for $15 billion over its decision to scrap the Keystone XL project — using a provision in the NAFTA trade deal.\\nCETA, which is currently being signed by EU members following a week-long blockade by Wallonia and two other Belgian regions, sets up an investor dispute system called the Investment Court System (ICS) .\\nIn fact the ICS was among the reasons that the Wallonian government took a stand, with the region’s leader Paul Magnette saying: “I would prefer that [the ICS] disappears pure and simple and that we rely on our courts or at the very least, if we want an arbitration court, it must provide equivalent guarantees to domestic ones.”\\nAs part of the newly negotiated agreement, the Belgian government will ask the European Court of Justice to rule on the legality of the deal — and the ICS in particular.\\nBeyond REACH REACH – the r egistration, e valuation, a uthorisation and restriction of ch emicals – is a set of extensive rules “adopted to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks that can be posed by chemicals” — so says the European Chemicals Agency .\\nCanada’s concerns – which were not formal actions, but rather issues raised at the WTO – largely related to rules around competition and whether the regulations would be burdensome to business .\\nThe 21 complaints spanned the administrations of the Liberal Paul Martin, when REACH was just a draft, and the Conservative Stephen Harper.\\nEssentially Canada – like the United States – takes issue with the European approach to regulation, which is described as the ‘precautionary principle’.\\nThis approach means products need to be proven safe by companies who seek to market them, before they enter the market. In North America, the burden of proof is on public authorities, which have to prove that a product is dangerous.\\nDocuments unearthed by CIEL show that Canada has filed objections to the EU using this approach to regulate endocrine disrupting chemicals, arguing that the “EU’s hazard-based approach could unnecessarily disrupt trade in food and feed”.\\nScientific studies show a range of health impacts caused by exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals – which are found in food containers and plastics – including IQ loss and adult obesity.'],\n",

       " ['Electronic Voting Machines Caught Switching Trump Votes To Hillary: “Trying to Steal Texas” | Survival',\n",
       "  \"(Before It's News)\\nThis article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published at Economic Collapse blog .\\nEditor’s Comment: In particular with electronic voting, the opportunity to flip votes and steal elections is almost unstoppable and will be very difficult to hold accountable. Nonetheless, that is exactly what activists in Texas and other key states should focus on. After decades of solid “red state” status, they are now talking openly about Hillary winning the Lone Star State and flipping it blue… despite being perhaps the most despised, unlikable and untrustworthy presidential candidate in modern history.\\nTake a look at the electoral college, and the shades of ‘blue and red states’ as things have been… if Team Hillary is able to steal Texas, there will be no way for Trump to win 270 electoral college, even if he wins Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states. Perhaps this has been their secret weapon all along, and the reason that she has been so arrogant throughout the entire campaign:\\nThese are dangerous times, and the establishment – after systematically denying the voice of the people on many fronts – is now making a huge gamble at holding onto power even in the face of obvious fraud. Will there be any legitimacy left in this country? And what happens if/when this election is stolen and everyone knows it?\\nIt Is Happening Again! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton\\nby Michael Snyder\\nIs the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.\\nMost Americans don’t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney’s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.\\nUnfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times …\\n“I don’t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.\\nStevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .\\n“I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney’s name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.\\nShe said that the first time she pushed “Romney,” the machine marked “Obama.”\\nSo she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.\\n“Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News.\\nAnd we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.\\nFor example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.\\nIf that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren’t even worth mentioning.\\nAnd of course this didn’t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .\\nThe reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.\\nIn Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper …\\nShortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes “switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.\\nAnd Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas …\\nGary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn’t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.\\nI don’t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.\\nA similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas …\\nHey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone’s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!\\nAnd of course they weren’t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon …\\nSo is there a serious problem with the voting machines?\\nAccording to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots…\\nChambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .\\nChambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise “omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.\\nLet’s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump’s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.\\nBut if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.\\nDespite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate“…\\nIn 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:\\nNearly 2 million deceased registered to vote\\nClose to 3 million registered in multiples states\\nApproximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate\\nMore than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters\\nApproximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state\\nBut despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled “ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead “…\\nAlmost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.\\nAmericans overall are more confident that the nation’s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.\\nUnfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.\\nAnd the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up …\\nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.\\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.\\nBut hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.\\nNow that is a real “conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn’t so serious.\\nDuring this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.\\nThe American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.\\nAnd let’s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.\"],\n",

       "  ' Trump is The Lesser Evil Because He\\x92s Such a Narcissist By Prof. Michael Hudson\\nShe a vindictive dictator, punishing her enemies, appointing neocons\\nWell, both Hillary and Donald Trump say the election is about the lesser evil. So, if that\\x92s true, who\\x92s the greater evil? Posted November 08, 2016\\nRoss Ashcroft: You\\x92ve got two candidates in the U.S. and one is very pro-Wall Street, specifically Goldman Sachs. She might as well be on the payroll. In fact, she is on the payroll. And the other is a rent-seeker -in-chief, and he\\x92s built real estate and used the banks. So you\\x92ve got Trump and you\\x92ve got Clinton. Both of them are in bed with Wall Street, fundamentally. But the people get it now.\\nMichael Hudson: Well, I think Hillary Clinton has a 79 percent disapproval rating, and Trump has an 81 percent disapproval rating. So you have the two most unpopular politicians in the United States as the choice. So basically, the voters in the United States are given a choice: \\x93Yes,\\x94\\x97\\x93Yes, please,\\x94 and \\x93Yes, thank you.\\x94 I think Trump missed his big chance to make a populist push. Instead of saying he\\x92s going to cut taxes on Wall Street, he can say, \\x93Look, I stiffed the banks. I went bankrupt four or six times. I screwed the banks and they didn\\x92t get paid and I can screw the banks for you people. Vote for me. I know how to do it.\\x94\\nAshcroft: Yes, he\\x92s missed that.\\nHudson: I think that would have been his winning ploy.\\nAshcroft: You should be his campaign strategist.\\nHudson: Well, except I don\\x92t think I\\x92d have many friends if I worked for Donald Trump. And we don\\x92t know that if he agreed with me today what he\\x92d do tomorrow. That\\x92s part of the problem. He doesn\\x92t play well with colleagues.\\nAshcroft: You sort of prefer him though\\x97would that be right? Because he doesn\\x92t play well with colleagues, because he\\x92s awkward, because he\\x92s a loner, because\\x97because you\\x92re saying you don\\x92t want a resourceful, intelligent and influential type in the job because the job\\x92s so powerful.\\nHudson: Well, both Hillary and Donald Trump say the election is about the lesser evil. So, if that\\x92s true, who\\x92s the greater evil? Hillary has a whole crowd behind her\\x97the neocons, who basically want to be very confrontational toward Russia and continue what she was doing in Libya to Syria\\x97militarily confrontational. Or you have Donald Trump, who doesn\\x92t really know who he can appoint and whether he can get enough people to work with him. So if the direction of America is to try to hold on to a unipolar world\\x97militarily confrontational\\x97you want a president who is least able to do evil. And there\\x92s no question, Trump is the lesser evil because he\\x92s such a narcissist, and really sort of a blank slate. And I\\x92d rather take a \\x93pig in a poke\\x94 than someone who\\x97you already know what Hillary will do. She\\x92ll do what the husband does. And it\\x92s\\x97the Clintons have corrupted the Democratic Party. That\\x92s what Bernie Sanders ran on against her\\x97\\nAshcroft: And did very well.\\nHudson: And did very well. But then he didn\\x92t realize that there really cannot be any progress by the labor unions, or consumers, or the 99 percent as long as the Democratic Party is controlled totally by Wall Street and by the Robert Rubin gang that they brought in. And they\\x92re really like a mafia gang. If you think the financial sector and the banking sector as crime\\x97and after all, remember, they\\x92ve paid billions and billions of dollars in civil fines without a single banker being sent to jail\\x97that\\x92s what a criminal wants to do. When the criminals take control of the justice system and take over the police force and bribe the judges\\x97all the Hollywood movies in the 1930s were that\\x97then you\\x92ve got the criminals in control. And you\\x92ve got the financial sector criminalized. That\\x92s what my colleague Bill Black at the University of Missouri at Kansas City has been emphasizing, and he\\x92s convinced all of us that the business plan of the big banks\\x97Citibank, Bank of America, we\\x92ve just got, and Wells Fargo, with all of the huge frauds that are coming out\\x97that was their business plan: fraud. And people are afraid to say that fraud is banking. They\\x92re afraid to say just exactly what the evidence is because it\\x92s considered impolite to talk about reality.\\nAshcroft: What sort of president then will Hillary Clinton be?\\nHudson: A dictator. She a vindictive dictator, punishing her enemies, appointing neocons in the secretary of state, in the defense department, appointing Wall Street people in the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, and the class war will really break out very explicitly. And she\\x92ll\\x97as Warren Buffet said, there is a class war and we\\x92re winning it.\\nAshcroft: As in the one percent are winning it.\\nHudson: The one percent are winning it. And she will try to use the rhetoric to tell people: \\x93Nothing to see here folks. Keep on moving,\\x94 while the economy goes down and down and she cashes in as she\\x92s been doing all along, richer and richer, and if she\\x92s president, there will not be an investigator of the criminal conflict of interest of the Bill Clinton Foundation, of pay-to-play. You\\x92ll have a presidency in which corporations who pay the Clintons will be able to set policy. Whoever has the money to buy the politicians will buy control of policy because elections have been privatized and made part of the market economy in the United States. That\\x92s what the Citizens United Supreme Court case was all about.\\nAshcroft: So that\\x92s another example of rent-seeking.\\nHudson: Yes, political payoffs. And that\\x92s the largest rent-seeking of all. Basically, for paying one penny, you get a whole dollar\\x92s worth of special privileges. And rent is really payment for a privilege. It\\x92s for a privilege that\\x92s created from the private sector. And basically as Balzac said, every great fortune originates in a great theft that isn\\x92t considered a great theft anymore because it\\x92s all viewed as part of the market. It\\x92s viewed as if that\\x92s how the world works. So you\\x92ll have a theft taking place and the Clintons will say, \\x93That\\x92s just how the world operates and GDP is going up because we\\x92re getting richer, enough to offset the degree by which you 99 percent are getting poor.\\x94'],\n",

       " ['Trump THREATENS Press In Closed-Door Meeting; Here Are The Terrifying Things He Said – New Century Times',\n",
       "  '\\nIn something that could’ve been scripted by George Orwell, President-elect Donald Trump just has pretty much every major media personality and/or outlet over to Trump Tower for a closed-door meeting. \\nThe NY Post stated : \\n“The hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC’s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC’s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, \\nAlso, CBS’ Norah O’Donnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and King, Fox News’ Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC’s Phil Griffin and CNN’s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett.” \\nBefore the meeting, everyone was speculating as to what was going on. Why is Trump colluding with the media? Is he trying to control the conversation and form some sort of state sponsored media? \\nWell, speculate no further. Trump called everyone to his tower to scold them like the Henry the 8th he is very much turning out to be. \\nAccording to one source who confided in the NY Post : \\n“It was like a f–ing firing squad…Trump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ‘I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed.” \\nAdding: \\n“The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down.” \\nIt was basically Trump throwing a hissy fit and talking down to everyone in the media to tell them how very awful they are to him. Even though they were pretty soft on him throughout the course of his campaign, often given him an open forum and hours of free airtime to tout his craziness. \\nAnother source said: \\n“The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks.” \\nFurther: \\n“Trump kept saying, ‘We’re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.’ He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars…Trump didn’t say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate – which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.” \\nSome of the media did try to get a word in edgewise, but it was pretty much all for naught. Trump was there to scold and not get a lesson from the media in freedom of the press and speech. \\nNY Post reported a source saying: \\n“[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, ‘How do you propose we the media work with you?’ Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked ‘How are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.” \\nAccording to Kellyanne Conway, however, it all went really well. Yet, it’s hard to believe a word that comes out of the Trump camp, because they will say only what they want people to hear, and most of the time there’s barely a sliver of the truth involved. \\nNo word as to who the source is that spoke to the NY Post . \\nIt’s pretty clear Trump wants to control the narrative of the press, why else would he have so many big news names over to his palace tower? He wanted to scold them and likely tell them how they should be operating, and we should all be very, very mortified that he even had them over in the first place. \\nAfter all, if you control the press, you control what the people hear. If you control what the people hear, you can tell them anything you want, even if it’s not in their best interests. It’s horrifying, to say the least, absolutely Hitler-esque, if we’re going to be honest. \\nThe press need to be counted on to hold Trump accountable for everything that he says or does, and if they don’t someone needs to hold the press accountable as well. This is a scary time we’re entering into and hopefully the Constitution will not be shredded and honesty with accountability will prevail. \\nFeatured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images '],\n",

       "  ' The Foul Stench of Fascism in the US\\n\"White America may be shocked by the election of Donald Trump. but black and brown America smelt it coming.\"\\nBy John Metta \" Al Jazeera \" - Throughout this summer and autumn, I have interviewed fellow minorities, asking them about their feelings and experiences regarding this presidential election. In all of these interviews, one thing was clear: We knew this was coming.\\nTo some of us, it hung like a foul smell in the air. The acrid stench that generations before somehow learned to live with, though it choked them. Many of us coughed and spluttered when that suffocating air filled our lungs. Some of us cried out in warning.\\nBut when those of us who spoke up were heard at all, we were greeted with disbelief, or with laughter. Like some others, I wrote about that laughter.\\nWe were given the assurance that yes, there were some for whom that acrid stench was a breath of fresh air, but those foolish people were few and unimportant. We were told the smell would go away on its own. It went nowhere. It lingered. And it got stronger.\\nAnd for some of us, it was more than a smell. For some unlucky ones such as Kozen Sampson, it became a physical assault.\\nIn February, Kozen parked his car in my beloved town of Hood River, Oregon, to take his dog for a walk. As Kozen told the town\\'s newspaper, \"I started to get out of the car, and heard someone yell, \\'Hey,\\' The car door smacked my head and then my head hit the door frame I lost part of my memory for about 15 minutes.\"\\nWhen news of the assault hit our small town, it shocked us all. We had a hard time believing it, especially when Kozen reported that the only other words he heard were \"F Muslim.\" Kozen, you see, is not a Muslim, he is a Buddhist monk and, in typical Buddhist monk fashion, his response was filled with compassion.\\n\"I am happy it happened to me and not to a Muslim,\" he said.\\n\\'I can\\'t feel safe in a third of my own country\\' In my church, we spoke at length about the assault and what it meant. By February, we had already seen that racism and white nationalism were on the rise. The fact that an innocent Buddhist monk was attacked at all was shocking, but that he was attacked for being something he wasn\\'t, for being nothing more than \"probably not white\" was what really smelled.\\nStill, my town assumed it was isolated. We assumed there was a small minority of people filled with hate.\\nWe assumed that the smell would go away on its own.\\nFor months, news stories abounded about white people verbally or physically attacking minorities, LGBT people, and people with disabilities. Still, many people - mostly white allies - thought that it was rare. Not something to worry about.\\nMiguel Carlos didn\\'t believe that for a minute.\\nMiguel is a black designer who was living in Philadelphia in July, but was returning to his native San Francisco. \"My white girlfriend and I are moving back to California this summer,\" he told me then.\\n\"We had originally planned to drive across the country and stop in Atlanta, New Orleans, Austin, and Phoenix. Needless to say, we\\'re not doing that any more.\" Miguel and his girlfriend took an plane instead. Too many stories of white backlash attacks in too many disparate places made them cancel their trip.\\n\"I was jokingly worried about being \\'a big, opinionated negro\\' in the south before this summer,\" he said. \"But now? It\\'s untenable. It\\'s incredibly sad that in 2016, I can\\'t feel safe in a third of my own country.\"\\nMiguel is not alone. By spring, many minority people in America had already changed their behaviour and outlook. Marina (name changed), an Asian artist from Los Angeles, began to avoid eye contact with people on the metro when someone looked at her and said, \"Chinese people are so filthy\".\\n\"These experiences with remarks, actions and violence have existed before but haven\\'t gotten the attention they\\'re getting now. Also, social media makes sharing these experiences easier than ever before, so things I\\'ve encountered I\\'ve kept to myself, but with Facebook and Twitter I\\'m talking about it.\"\\nTalking with people throughout the summer, I saw this pattern repeated. Minority people of various ethnic, religious, and racial groups were all doing the same things.\\nThey were talking about the foul smell in the air, pointing out the real danger to anyone who would listen, and they were all being more cautious around white people. Many of them changed their behaviour in small, subtle ways. \"I wear headphones more at work now,\" said Deborah (name changed), a white lesbian woman who wants to remain anonymous for fear of a backlash at the legal practice where she works outside Portland, Oregon.\\n\"Because I just want to avoid the chance of getting into \\'that interaction\\' again.\"\\n\"That interaction\" was being verbally assaulted and called \"evil\" because she spoke about wanting to marry her partner. Even in Portland, national symbol of quirkiness, a lesbian woman felt afraid to argue for her right to a marriage that the state had already given her.\\nWilliam James, a black writer and actor in Orlando, Florida, who did not want his real name used, had a somewhat similar take on avoiding arguments when he talked about the police. \"The goal is not to win the argument,\" he told me. \"The goal is to get home alive.\" William happens to be 4ft tall and his car is fitted with special gearing to allow him to drive only with his hands. It is a car that only someone his size can operate.\\n\"But a white cop pulls me over one day,\" he told me, \"and is looking me up and down, looking at my insurance and my registration, and he asks me \\'Is this your car?\\' I mean, what is that question supposed to mean? We all know what it\\'s supposed to mean. You\\'re looking at my registration, and I have a car only I can drive. I know why you\\'re asking that question, but I\\'m not going to say that, because the goal is to get home alive, so I just say \\'Yes, sir. It is\\'.\"\\nThis is America, 2016.\\n\\' White men are taking America back to the 1850s\\' I heard similar responses throughout the summer and autumn: Minority people universally spoke of this election as a threat, they spoke of being scared. White people universally saw it as comical, an accidental event that would just disappear, that couldn\\'t really happen here.\\nSarah Kendzior warned us of exactly that sentiment. A political writer who studied fascism, Sarah has written of the seriousness of this election in numerous essays, telling us that \"it can\\'t happen here\" is exactly how fascism happens. Her essays are like a plan for how to avoid a catastrophe, yet it seems that no one wanted to bring her map on this journey.\\nIn August, I warned us too, writing that \"we are on the cusp of a historic decision in the US. We can make history and transition from the first black to the first female president. The alternative is to make history by electing our first fascist demagogue.\" America has made our choice.\\nSome of us knew this was coming.\\nRebecca Romani, an adjunct professor of ESL (English as a second language) and Media Studies at San Diego State University, has seen this in other countries and has been \"deeply appalled and offended that we are heading down the slippery slope to racially - and economically - inspired fascism\".\\n\"My grandparents were enemy aliens in World War II, we were almost in internment again in 2003, and I feel the icy breath of the ghost of E0 9066 rising for me, some of my friends and extended family.\" Executive Order 9066 was the presidential authorisation for Japanese internment during World War II.\\n\"I fear a return to some dystopian 1950s idyll where women and others knew their place.\"\\nMiguel, now returned to his native San Francisco, put it more bluntly: \"I\\'ve been saying all along that I\\'d wake up this morning still black in America, no matter who won. The south is unsafe for me because of the people there and their politics, not because of who\\'s president.\"\\nWilliam had been expecting it as well. \"As people of colour we\\'ve known that racism has always been out there, but it\\'s been \\'somewhat\\' under wraps. Now it\\'s been given a voice and subsequent free reign.\"\\n\"I\\'m just so very sad,\" he continued, \"that Obama has to hand over the keys to the very man who called his humanity into question. Just like those mothers of the movement, he doesn\\'t get the luxury of voicing his anger. He has to be the role model.\"\\nSome people feel sad, some are angry, many are just more scared than they were before. This summer, such an outcome was only a possibility; now, it is a reality.\\nThe day after the election, William and I talked about our outlook and about the older generation of black people who are now speaking words like \"Hold your tongue\" and \"Be careful,\" words they used in the days before and during the Civil Rights Movement.\\n\"Being a part of that older generation,\" he said, \"I have to agree with them. [White men] are taking America back to the 1850s. The landscape is changing. Those in power who have a similar point of view as yourself may not be in power tomorrow. And let\\'s not forget the promised bald-faced retribution.\"\\nWilliam told me to be careful of that retribution when I write. \"You can\\'t afford to go full bore.\" But that is the silence that allows fascism to rise. That fear causes the silence Sarah Kendzior warns us about. She noted on Twitter that researchers pitched a story about how white nationalists were radicalised online, but the story was refused because the media was afraid to run it .\\nThe New York Times reported that The American Bar Association refused to publish a report about the presidential candidate citing the threat of being sued. Let that sink in: The governing body of America\\'s lawyers is afraid of being sued.\\nThey were scared into silence by our (now) president elect. This is the silence that allows fascism to rise.\\nSilence is what hog-tied the Republican Party, fear of retribution caused them to accept their fate. The silence of Liberal America allowed a demagogue to rise as they laughed at him and his followers.\\nAnd then there\\'s the silence of the Democratic Party. A silence of short-term economic goals and the knowledge that they didn\\'t have to actually perform for marginalised communities in order to be \"owed\" their votes.\\nMany of us know that the Democratic Party was no small part of what was to come.\\nThis has been brewing since the neo-liberals took over Congress, increasingly gutting anti-trust regulations, workers\\' protections, promoting violent policies towards other nations \"in our national interests\", and ever moving the party towards the right.\\nThe appearance of Democrats as disconnected and \"the educated elite\" was bolstered by the fact that, by and large, the national party turned its back on both actual peace in the rest of the world and on the survival of the working-class whites who should have been part of its base.\\nToday working-class whites can\\'t look to the Democrats for real support, and minority people are increasingly angered that their vote never results in substantive change for the better. Is it any surprise that the minority vote was apathetic and the white vote was against them?\\nAnd yet, still, many people were surprised.\\nThere is nothing at all surprising here. This is a trend that has been nearly a century in the making. Minority people across America - especially black women - have been warning us about it while Liberal America laughed at John Oliver\\'s jokes.\\nNow Liberal America is reeling. Hamid Dabashi wrote in Al Jazeera that \"Liberal America is now scared that [he] will do to America what America has done to the world.\"\\n\" For the world at large,\" Dabashi wrote, \"and at the receiving end of American military might, [he] is the very quintessence of America because [he] is what America does to the world, and now it has come dangerously close to do unto itself what it has habitually done unto others.\"\\nThis is certainly true, but it\\'s not the entire truth. The truth is that America is dangerously close to doing unto it\\'s white self what it has habitually done to others. America, as a whole, has never had much of a problem doing exactly that to its black and brown citizens.\\nAsk black and Latino people who have lived for generations with an increasingly militarised police force if things will suddenly be different for them in America. Ask the Native people protesting for water security at Standing Rock if life will suddenly be different for them in America.\\nWhen has America not been a colonial power to its black and brown people? At its best, America holds a grudging tolerance for us - giving us access to the legal system, yes, but modifying it for white convenience and \"safety\". At its worst, America attacks black and brown citizens with laws designed to deny black agency and meets black freedom with military force. Even now, America gasses indigenous brown people on their native land in favour of a corporate entity.\\nThe truth is that for many minority people America has always treated them the way that it has treated the world. The only thing that has changed is that now America is about to turn on its white citizens too.\\nThis is what Jean-Paul Voilleque, a straight, white lawyer in Portland, found the day after the election. He was dressed in his business casual jeans and a bright blue shirt, and was met on his way to work by the new regime. Crossing a footbridge over the Willamette River, a white man \"in well-worn clothes\" shouted that he was \"a faggot\". Another white woman, wearing a scarf to cover her head from the chill, was told to go back to her own country.\\nMartha, a white public school teacher is \"furious at myself, a middle-class heterosexual white woman, for being a part of what got this country to last night\\'s horror show.

       " ['U.S. Health Care Lags Behind, Costs More Than Other Countries',\n",
       "  'Most Americans are going to pay a lot more for health insurance in 2017. They also will pay considerably more out of their pockets for copayments, prescriptions and satisfying large deductibles. However, the U.S. health care system costs users more than medical care in other countries, but people are not getting their money’s worth as levels of care lag behind what is offered in other Western countries.\\nLove it or hate it, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) did enable an estimated 23 million in the country to get coverage. However, the ACA and market dynamics have made that care less than affordable for many. They are in health plans that only pay for physicals and major medical expenses, after a considerable deductible. Consequently, 33 percent of American adults did not see a doctor when they needed one or failed to fill a prescription for financial reasons. (A comparable study in 2013 – before the ACA health plans were introduced – showed 37 percent did not get needed care.)\\nAmericans have worse health and are less likely to seek treatment then in other wealthy Western nations, like the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and France. This was according to a study published in “Health Affairs.” (By comparison, only 7 to 8 percent in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K. did not obtain care because of cost considerations.)\\nThe 2016 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey was conducted by telephone. They surveyed adults in those countries, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland this spring. Survey participants were asked about experiences with their health care system, in terms of access, quality of care, and affordability, as well as questions about their overall health.\\nCost Issues Compared The cost of medical care and health insurance also affects Americans’ ability to afford other things. Approximately 31 percent of the adults in the U.S. surveyed reported hardships due to health care costs. Broken down, 15 percent worried about affording nutritious food and 16 percent struggled to afford housing.\\nCaps on annual spending for medical care and subsidies for lower-income adults and families help in the U.S. However, other countries make more of an effort to remove the cost barriers to care. For example, in Canada, the Netherlands, and the U.K., there are no medical plan deductibles or co-payments for primary care. The French exempt lower-income adults as well as people with chronic illnesses from co-payments and other cost sharing. Germany and Sweden cap out-of-pocket spending far lower for those who are chronically ill.\\nThe U.S. performed worse in nearly all the measures studied in comparison to respondents from all 11 countries researched. Only Canada joined the U.S. in one ignominious area: More than one-fifth of adults reported that having more than one chronic health issue, such as heart problems, asthma, diabetes, or arthritis. (In the U.S., 28 percent had two conditions and, in Canada, 22 percent did.)\\nChanges to the ACA are top priorities for the Republic-dominated Congress and President-elect Donald Trump. This survey indicates, however, that health care affordability in the U.S. lags far behind other Westernized countries, and costs continue to rise. With the election over, there needs to be a rhetoric-free discussion on providing access to actually “affordable” care.\\nWritten and Edited by Dyanne Weiss\\nSources:\\nHealth Affairs: In New Survey Of Eleven Countries, US Adults Still Struggle With Access To And Affordability Of Health Care\\nFortune: America Is Still One of the Unhealthiest Countries in the World\\nHealthcare Informatics: Let’s Think Internationally about Health care Policy Challenges—and Where HIT Fits In\\nBecker’s Hospital CFO : US adults still struggle with access to and cost of healthcare, survey of 11 nations finds\\nPhoto courtesy of U.S. Navy [Public domain] ACA , affordable care , costs , health care'],\n",
       " [\"The B'nai Brith and the History of the Mounting Assault on Academic Freedom in Canadian Universities\",\n",
       "  \"Prof. Rafiq Islam Responds to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Punjab Outlining the Background of the Hall Case at the 2 Shares\\n1 0 0 1\\nDear Vice Chancellor Kamran:\\nSalam from the East coast of Canada.\\nThank you for taking the time to address this important issue regarding Professor Hall. Like yourself, we all have been stunned by the voracity of Dr. Mahon’s action. We used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the Establishment. We all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group. However, B’nai Brith is not just a special interest group, it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west. Allow me to elaborate.\\nYou have correctly identified B’nai Brith to be “behind this movement against shutting down free speech.” While this statement is accurate, this phenomenon of targeting Canadian universities and Canadian society is not something that started now. Not too long ago, it used to be branded as ‘the hidden hand behind the hidden hand’. During the Harper era, this operation became a full-blown politically driven policy directive. The legislation that Dr. Mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the Harper era. Harper had an extremist right-wing background and organizations like B’nai Brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda. As early as the 1980s, I personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of Muslim Student Association at the University of Alberta. Although Harper didn’t attend that university, we were not too far from the epicentre of the neo-conservatism movement that was brewing in Canada. We fast-forward 30 years and come upon the type of events such as Professor Hall travesty that are products of that time. In fact, a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of Canadian lives. Only recently, we had this court ruling against Canadian Security Intelligence Service that was illegally spying on the public. This gangster-like involvement started in 2006, shortly after Harper and the neocon came to power.\\nThis is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government. In fact, the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime. Take for instance the case of Omar Khadr travesty .\\nMORE... Creating an Anti-Muslim Bias at a Canadian University Suspension of Tenured Professor Lacks Due Diligence Toxic Mind Control Contaminates The Public Sphere Irish human rights activists against freedom of speech? This case is something we had known, albeit too late to intervene at the time, and has been subsequently discredited publicly, even during the Harper regime . The overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely 16 year old, Omar Khadr, who said, “ You don’t care about me ”. This is what defines the mindset of these people, bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience.\\nThe attack on Professor Hall was particularly toxic, but equally sinister attacks have taken place before. Some decade ago, now defunct Canadian Islamic Congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring. It was the largest Muslim Organization at a time Canadian Muslims became the largest religious minority. One particular episode involved B’nai Brith’s planted story involving a University professor, who became the target of hate crime, while at the same time investigated for hate crime. If it wasn’t for the humane and civic behaviour of the then University president (current Governor General), David Johnston, it would have become career threatening, if not life threatening event of the professor. Top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from ‘donors’ that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena. The vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today. What we don’t know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing.\\nClearly, some of the faithful members/sympathizers apply it publicly. Such was the case of former professor turned politician, Irwin Cotler, who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia. Then there are others, such as Alan Rock of University of Ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia. A third group would be Lorna Marsden of York University that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda. Yet, others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence. It doesn’t matter which category they belong to, they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and, for some cases, join in to the atrocity. This obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late Professor David Noble, who ended up suing York University and Canadian Jewish Congress jointly for conspiring against him. Professor Noble, a Jew himself, faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of Jews. That wasn’t enough, Dr. Noble had to take on Human Rights Commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the University authority. Professor Noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon University of Ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of Alan Rock, a man without a PhD that was at the helm of the University. Mr. Rock recently left the University—but not before leaving the University’s good name in the sewerage of politicking. What Dr. Mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim.\\nHad I not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last 30 years, I would almost not understand what is at works here. In old days, such tactic would be unheard-of in a University. Certainly, such things couldn’t happen in a civilized country, I would exclaim.\\nSo, what happened to Professor Hall is not new. What is new is the waking up of the general public. Your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about Professor Hall. People are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice. For instance, in the context of CSIS, an activist, Jim Comeau wrote, “I would say it's time to jail the highest ranking CSIS to send a clear message to the rest of them, do something illegal, straight to prison. They damn well knew what they were doing was illegal.”\\nThe People’s revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of Julian Assange, who wrote on US General election day (November 8, 2016):\\n“Yet, some weeks ago, in a tactic reminiscent of Senator McCarthy and the red scare, Wikileaks, Green Party candidate Stein, Glenn Greenwald and Clinton’s main opponent were painted with a broad, red brush. The Clinton campaign, when they were not spreading obvious untruths, pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with Russia. The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications—because none exists.\\nIn the end, those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them – a reason for censorship the First Amendment cannot tolerate. Only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate.”\\nOf course, recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the United States.\\nTo anyone with an iota of conscience, there is no mystery here. People are making their voice clearly known. In the words of Claire Lanyado, “I prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil.” The problem is, when a president of University for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately, there is no recourse for a professor to fight him/her. In other cases, if such atrocity were launched against a student (e.g. the case of Freeman-Maloy vs. Lorna Marsden of York University ), the student, an anti-Zionist Jew, could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another Jewish lawyer, Peter Rosenthal (who himself is a University professor of Mathematics). It was struck down by the court, and then it was overruled by the court of appeals. At the end, the University settled and Dr. Marsden, the embattled President was gone. The morale of this story is, the path to justice is steep, but for a professor, the path to justice is becoming impossible.\\nThe irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes, just because they dare speak out against an atrocity. Of course, they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice.\\nThat’s how extremism works.\\n Sincerely,\\nRafiq Islam\"],\n",

Will Hillary win and then declare WWIII against her Russia/Iran/Syria “axis of evil”? Will the Middle East totally explode? Will the pivot to Asia totally implode? Will China be ruling the world by 2025?\\nAmidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins, the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late, great, deconstructionist master Jean Baudrillard. During the post-mod 1980s it was hip to be Baudrillardian to the core; his America, originally published in France in 1986, should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical/geological/cultural Instagram of Exceptionalistan.\\nBy the late 1990s, at the end of the millennium, two years before 9/11 – that seminal “before and after” event – Baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze. Now, it’s a black market paroxysm.\\nGlobal multitudes are subjected to a black market of work – as in the deregulation of the official market; a black market of unemployment; a black market of financial speculation; a black market of misery and poverty; a black market of sex (as in prostitution); a black market of information (as in espionage and shadow wars); a black market of weapons; and even a black market of thinking.\\nWay beyond the late 20th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as “liberal democracy” – actually a neoliberal diktat – has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l’oeil effect. What’s left is a widespread, noxious condition; the pre-emptive prohibition of any critical thought, which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine (or finding the right internet niche).\\nBaudrillard already knew that the concept of “alter” – killed by conviviality – does not exist in the official market. So an “alter” black market also sprung up, co-opted by traffickers; that’s, for instance, the realm of racism, nativism and other forms of exclusion. Baudrillard already identified how a “contraband alter”, expressed by sects and every form of nationalism (nowadays, think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme-right wing political parties) was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant, obsessed with regimentation, and totally homogenized.\\nThere could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures, signs, differences and “values”; but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact IT replica – artificial intelligence, playing with the line of demarcation between human and non-human in the domain of thought.\\nThe result, previewed by Baudrillard, was the secretion of a parapolitical society – with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption (think the financial Masters of the Universe). Power is unable to fight this mafia – and that would be, on top of it, hypocritical, because the mafia itself emanates from power.\\nThe end result is that what really matters today, anywhere, mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits; like in a social black market.\\nIs there any information “truth”?\\nBaudrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine, producing value, producing signs of wealth, but not wealth itself. The whole media/information system – still ruled by America – is a massive machine producing events as signs; exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology, the star system and catastrophism.\\nThis abstraction of information works as in the economy – disgorging a coded material, deciphered in advance, and negotiable in terms of models, as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value.\\nSince all merchandise, thanks to this abstraction of value, is exchangeable, then every event (or non-event) is also exchangeable, all replacing one another in the cultural market of information.\\nAnd that takes us to where we live now; Trans-History, and Trans-Politics – where events have really not happened, as they get lost in the vacuum of information (as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation).\\nThus this quintessential Baudrillard insight; if we consider History as a movie – and that’s what it is now – then the “truth” of information is no more than post-production synch, dubbing and subtitles.\\nStill, as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events, there is immense disappointment as well, because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them. Call it a pathetic, universal contagion; people don’t know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm – in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences.\\nNo acts, deeds, crimes (the 2008 financial crisis), political events (the WikiLeaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the “nonprofit” Clinton cash machine, what’s private and what’s public, the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth, and the affairs of the state)\\nseem to have real consequences.\\nImmunity, impunity, corruption, speculation – we veer towards a state of zero responsibility (think Goldman Sachs). So, automatically, we yearn for an event of maximum consequence, a “fatal” event to repair that scandalous non-equivalence. Like a symbolic re-equilibrium of the scales of destiny.\\nSo we dream of an amazing event – Trump winning the election? Hillary declaring WWIII? – that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes.\\nShadowing the world\\nJust like Baudrillard, I got to see “deep” America in the 1980s and 1990s by driving across America.\\nSo sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning, “Objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear.”\\nBut what if they may also be further than they appear?\\nThe contemporary instant event/celebrity culture deluge of images upon us; does it get us closer to a so-called “real” world that is in fact very far away from us? Or does it in fact keep the world at a distance – creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent?\\nIn parallel, we keep slouching towards a single future language – the language of algorithms, as designed across the Wall Street/Silicon Valley axis – that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe, just like the globalist/New World Order dream of One Thought and One Culture.\\nLanguages are multiple and singular – by definition. If there were a single language, words would become univocal, regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning. There would be no interplay – as in artificial languages there’s no interplay. Language would be just the meek appendix of a unified reality – the negative destiny of a languidly unified human species.\\nThat’s where the American “dream” seems to be heading.

       "  'Picture, if you will, video footage of vintage (early 2016) Donald Trump buffoonery with the CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves commenting on major media’s choice to give Trump vastly more air time than other candidates: “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.”\\nThat’s the introduction to a powerful critique of the U.S. media. A new film screens in New York and Los Angeles this week called All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone .\\nThe website AllGovernmentsLie.com has screening dates , a list of lies , and a list of good journalists who expose lies . The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film, but there’s a good deal of overlap — enough to give you a sense of what this project is about.\\nI’d have made various changes and additions to the film. In particular, I’m tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003. This film touches on war lies since then, but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence.\\nStill, this is a film that should be shown in cities, homes, and classrooms across the United States. It includes and is driven by Noam Chomsky’s analysis of how the media system is “rigged” without those doing the rigging believing they’ve done anything at all. It’s a survey of skullduggery by corporate media. It’s an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm. And it’s an introduction to I.F. Stone. It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stone’s tradition.\\nOne of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin (non-)Incident. Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie. And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense. That is: had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a U.S. ship off their coast, that would not have been any sort of legal, much less moral, justification for escalating a war. I’d love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and every other part of the earth today.\\nBut the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the U.S. ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the U.S. role of Global Policeman. Someone had to make the lies transparent. Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of So-Called Defense and the President were lying. Sadly, nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings, and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war.\\nAnd it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed, and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did. Yet, those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew. And they knew it because of I.F. Stone who just weeks after the (non-)incident published a four-page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin.\\nStone’s analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen. And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964. The United Nations, including its U.S. ambassador, had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory. President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia. And President Lyndon Johnson, even at the time of Tonkin, Stone notes, was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other.\\nStone, who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to, pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks: the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter. The latter two are still theoretically in place for the U.S. government.\\nThe United States in Vietnam, Stone goes on to show, could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats. And indeed the U.S. ships, Stone reports, were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands. And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the U.S. military and the good old American tax payers.\\nStone did not have access to closed committee hearings, but he hardly needed it. He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war. And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees. He found their denials to be non-denials and nonsensical. It made no sense that the U.S. ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships. Stone didn’t believe it.\\nStone also filled in the background information. The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the non-incident. And Stone raised numerous suspicions, including the question of why the U.S. ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the (non-)incident to (not) occur, and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military (something nobody could explain, though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored).\\nMissing from the film and website of All Governments Lie is I.F. Stone’s work on lies about the outbreak of the Korean War. We’ve learned more since he wrote it, but seen little more insightful, relevant, or timely for our understanding of Korea and the world today.\\n David Swanson wants you to declare peace at http://WorldBeyondWar.org His new book is War No More: The Case for Abolition .'],\n",

       "  'Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump…it turns out Trump was right…he didn’t need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‘never Trumpers’ from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him… \\nIt’s easy to glance at Tuesday’s popular vote — which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 – and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama’s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states — Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin — Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What’s more, she far surpassed Obama’s 2012 vote total in Florida, the country’s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. \\nA review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country’s most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation’s most critical battleground states. Let’s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren’t yet final because not all precincts have reported. \\nFLORIDA — 29 EVs — 98 percent reporting \\nObama 2012: 4,235,270 \\nClinton 2016: 4,485,745 TRENDING ON 100% Fed Up '],\n",

       "  ' 2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election\\nUnearthed tape: \\'We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win\\'\\nBy Ken Kurson\\n \" Observer \" - On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.\\nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.\\nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton\\x92s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is \\x93rigged.\\x94\\nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).\\n\\x93I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,\\x94 said Sen. Clinton. \\x93And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.\\x94\\nChomsky recalls being taken aback that \\x93anyone could support the idea\\x97offered by a national political leader, no less\\x97that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.\\x94\\nSome eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.\\nRegarding capturing combatants in war\\x97the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind\\x97Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, \\x93And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there\\x92s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we\\x92ve got to capture a soldier.\\x94\\nEquating Hamas, which to this day remains on the State Department\\x92s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper\\x92s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase \\x93these cultures\\x94 is also a bit of a head-scratcher.\\nAccording to Chomsky, Clinton was \\x93gracious, personable and pleasant throughout\\x94 the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz.\\nAnother part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign\\x97speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he\\x92d \\x93get along\\x94 with Putin.\\nChomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation.\\n\\x93Do you think it\\x92s worth talking to Syria\\x97both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel\\x92s point [of view]?\\x94\\nClinton replied, \\x93You know, I\\x92m pretty much of the mind that I don\\x92t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you\\x92re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,\\x94 an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016.\\nShortly after, she said, \\x93But if you say, \\x91they\\x92re evil, we\\x92re good, [and] we\\x92re never dealing with them,\\x92 I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I\\x92ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That\\x92s my take on it.\\x94\\nA final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, \\x93I think you can make the case that whether you call it \\x91Islamic terrorism\\x92 or \\x91Islamo-fascism,\\x92 whatever the label is we\\x92re going to give to this phenomenon, it\\x92s a threat. It\\x92s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States Therefore we need a global response. It\\x92s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there\\x92s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.\\x94\\nIt\\x92s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what\\x92s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase \\x93Islamic terrorism\\x94 and the even more strident \\x93Islamo-fascism,\\x94 at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper.\\nIn an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some \\x93odd and controversial comments\\x94 on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined \\x93Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,\\x94 is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story.\\n\\x93I went to my bosses at the time,\\x94 Chomsky told the Observer. \\x93The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody\\x97even a direct Quote: from anyone\\x97in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn\\x92t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.\\x94\\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, publisher of Observer Media.'],\n",

       "  ' Trump\\x92s Slim Chance for Greatness\\nSpecial Report: Donald Trump\\x92s unlikely victory created the opportunity to finally break with the orthodoxy of Washington\\x92s neocon/liberal-hawk foreign policy, but can Trump find enough fresh thinkers to do the job, asks Robert Parry.\\nBy Robert Parry\\nNovember 16, \" Consortium News \" - Donald Trump must decide \\x96 and decide quickly \\x96 whether he wants to be a great U.S. President or a robo-signature machine affixing his name to whatever legislation comes from congressional Republicans and a nodding figurehead acquiescing to more neoconservative foreign policy adventures.\\nOr, to put it in a vernacular that Trump might use, does he want to be \\x93Paul Ryan\\x92s bitch\\x94 on domestic policies? And does he want to surrender his foreign policy to the \\x93wise guys\\x94 of Washington\\x92s neocon establishment.\\nTrump\\x92s problem is that he has few fully developed ideas about how to proceed in a presidency that even many of his close followers did not expect would happen. Plus, over the past few decades, the neocons and their liberal-hawk sidekicks have marginalized almost every dissenting expert, including old-line \\x93realists\\x94 who once were important figures.\\nSo, the bench of \\x93confirmable\\x94 experts who have dissented on neocon/liberal-hawk policies is very thin. To find national security leaders who would break with the prevailing \\x93group thinks,\\x94 Trump would have go outside normal channels and take a risk on some fresh thinkers.\\nBut most mainstream media accounts doubt that he will. That is why speculation has centered on Trump settling on several neocon retreads for Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, such as former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former CIA Director James Woolsey and ex-National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, all staunch supporters of George W. Bush\\x92s disastrous Iraq War which Trump has denounced.\\n\\x91Team of Rivals\\x92\\nIf Trump is guided in that direction, he will make the same mistake that President Barack Obama made during the 2008 transition when Obama was seduced by the idea of a Lincoln-esque \\x93Team of Rivals\\x94 and staffed key top national security jobs with hawks \\x97 keeping Bush\\x92s Defense Secretary Robert Gates , hiring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and leaving in place top generals, such as David Petraeus .\\nThat decision trapped the inexperienced Obama into a policy of continuity with Bush\\x92s wars and related policies, such as domestic spying, rather than enabling Obama to achieve his promised \\x93change.\\x94\\nFaced with powerful \\x93rivals\\x94 within his own administration, Obama was maneuvered into an ill-considered \\x93counterinsurgency\\x94 escalation in Afghanistan in 2009 that did little more than get another 1,000 U.S. soldiers killed along with many more Afghans.\\nSecretary Clinton also sold out the elected progressive president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, when he was ousted in a coup in 2009, signaling to Latin America that \\x93El Norte\\x94 hadn\\x92t changed much.\\nThen, Clinton sabotaged Obama\\x92s first attempt in 2010 to enlist the help of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to work out a deal with Iran on constraining its nuclear program. Clinton favored an escalating confrontation with Iran along the lines dictated by Israeli hardliners.\\nClinton and the other hawks succeeded in thwarting Obama\\x92s will because, as Gates wrote in his memoir Duty , Gates and Clinton were \\x93un-fireable\\x94 in that they could challenge Obama whenever they wished while realizing that Obama would have to pay an unacceptably high price to remove them.\\nAs clever \\x93inside players,\\x94 Gates, Clinton and Petraeus also understood that if Obama balked at their policy prescriptions, they could undercut him by going to friends in the mainstream news media and leaking information about how Obama was \\x93weak\\x94 in not supporting a more warlike approach to problems.\\nObama\\x92s Real Weakness\\nYet, by failing to stand up to this neocon/liberal-hawk pressure , Obama did make himself weak. Essentially, he never got control of his foreign policy and even after the Gates-Clinton-Petraeus trio was gone by the start of Obama\\x92s second term, the President still feared angering Washington\\x92s foreign policy establishment which often followed the heed of Israel\\x92s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\nObama was so worried about Israel that, at the apex of his power after winning reelection in 2012, Obama went on a several-day trip to visit Netanyahu in a craven attempt to show his love and obeisance to Israel. Obama took similar trips to Saudi Arabia.\\nStill, that was not enough to spare him the wrath of Netanyahu and the Saudi royals when Obama finally pushed successfully for an Iran nuclear deal in 2014. Netanyahu humiliated Obama by accepting a Republican invitation in 2015 to speak to a joint session of Congress where he urged U.S. lawmakers to repudiate their own President.\\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia demanded and got new concessions from Obama on arms sales and his grudging support for their proxy war in Syria as well as their direct aerial bombardment of Yemen \\x96 both part of a Sunni Wahhabist sectarian strategy for destroying Shiite-related regimes. (The Sunni/Shiite clash dates back to the Seventh Century.)\\nIndeed, the little-recognized Israeli-Saudi alliance targeting the so-called \\x93Shiite crescent\\x94 \\x96 Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Iran \\x96 is at the heart of what has been driving U.S. policy in the Middle East since the 1990s.\\nAnd, if President-elect Trump wants to truly reverse the downward spiral of the United States as it has squandered trillions of dollars in futile Mideast wars, he will have to go up against the Israeli-Saudi tandem and make it clear that he will not be manipulated as Obama was.\\nFacing down such a powerful coalition of Israel (with its extraordinary U.S. lobbying apparatus) and Saudi Arabia (with its far-reaching financial clout) would require both imagination and courage. It would not be possible if Trump surrounds himself with senior advisers under the thumb of Prime Minister Netanyahu and King Salman.\\nSo, we will learn a great deal about whether Trump is a real player or just a pretender when he selects his foreign policy team. Will he find imaginative new thinkers who can break the disastrous cycles of Mideast wars and reduce tensions with Russia or will he just tap into the usual suspects of Republican orthodoxy?\\nSunlight on the Swamp\\nTrump could also show his independence from Republican orthodoxy by recognizing that government secrecy has gone way too far, a drift into opacity that dates back to Ronald Reagan and his reversal of the more open-government policies of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.\\nTrump says he wants to \\x93drain the swamp\\x94 of Washington, but to do that first requires letting in much more sunlight and sharing much more information with the American people.\\nFor starters \\x96 assuming that the timid Obama won\\x92t take the risk \\x96 President Trump could pardon national security whistleblowers who have faced or could face prosecution, such as Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange, John Kiriakou, Jeffrey Sterling and Edward Snowden.\\nThat could be followed by an executive order forbidding excessive secrecy inside the federal government, recognizing that \\x93We the People\\x94 are the nation\\x92s true sovereigns and thus deserve as much information as possible while protecting necessary secrets.\\nTrump could show he means business about respecting average American citizens by sharing with them U.S. intelligence assessments on key controversies, such as the Aug. 21, 2013 sarin gas attack in Syria and the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 shoot-down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. [See here and here. ]\\nThe Obama administration has engaged in selective release of information about these mysteries to manipulate U.S. public opinion, not to inform and thus empower the American people. Trump could go a long way toward restoring public trust by renouncing such tricks.\\nHe also could save many billions of dollars by shutting down U.S. propaganda agencies whose role also is to use various P.R. tricks to shape both foreign and domestic opinion, often in the cause of \\x93regime changes\\x94 or \\x93color revolutions.\\x94\\nTrump could shut down the State Department\\x92s Office of Public Diplomacy , return the U.S. Agency for International Development to its legitimate purpose of helping poor countries build schools and drill wells, and shutter the trouble-making National Endowment for Democracy .\\nBy steering the world away from the New Cold War with nuclear-armed Russia, Trump could not only help save the future of mankind, he could save trillions of dollars that otherwise would end up in the pockets of the Military-Industrial Complex.\\nFDR or Coolidge?\\nRegarding domestic policy, some Republicans expect that Trump will simply sign off on whatever Ayn-Rand-inspired legislation that House Speaker Ryan pushes through Congress, whether turning Medicare into a voucher program or privatizing Social Security.\\nIn this area, too, Trump will have to decide whether he wants to be a great president in the mold of Franklin Roosevelt or someone more of the caliber of Calvin Coolidge.\\nTrump also must face the reality that he has lost the popular vote by a rather significant margin \\x96 almost a million votes in the latest tallies \\x96 and thus only has the presidency because of the archaic Electoral College. In other words, he lacks a real mandate from the people.\\nWhen confronted with a similar situation in 2000, George W. Bush chose to pretend that he had a decisive mandate for his right-wing policies, shoved them down the Democrats\\x92 throats (such as his massive tax cut mostly for the rich that wiped out the budget surplus), and eventually saw his failed presidency sink into bitter partisanship.\\nRepublicans will surely urge Trump to do the same, to ignore the popular vote, but he might do well to surprise people by looking for overlapping areas where Democrats and Republicans can cooperate.\\nFor instance, many Democrats fear that Trump will undo the difficult progress made on climate change over the past eight years. After all, Trump has voiced doubts about the scientific consensus on the existential threat posed by global warming.\\nBut Trump also wants to invest heavily in America\\x92s infrastructure (plus he has vowed to help the inner cities). So, there\\x92s potential common ground if Trump were to launch a major program to create a world-class mass transit system for urban and suburban areas.\\nTrump might even turn to one of his critics, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, for Transportation Secretary with instructions to study mass transit in Japan and Europe and implement a similar system in the United States, quickly. Besides creating jobs and improving life for urban dwellers (who largely supported Hillary Clinton), quality and fast mass transit could get millions of Americans out of their cars and thus help in the fight against global warming, too.\\nTo demonstrate a willingness to reach across the aisle on such important issues, Trump might even consider offering Energy Secretary to Al Gore.\\nBut such bold steps would require Trump to have the courage and creativity to go against the Republican \\x93playbook\\x94 which calls for a zero-sum game against the Democrats.\\nWhether Trump has such courage and foresight is the pressing question of the moment. Will he go for true greatness (both for himself and America) or will he be content to have his name and face on one of those place mats showing the 45 U.S. Presidents?\\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

       "  'News Outlets Already Report Hillary Losing By Landslide News Outlets Already Report Hillary Losing By Landslide Posted By admin on November 8, 2016 Subscribe In an unlikely and surprisingly early turn of events, news outlets across the country have reported that enough early votes have already come in to determine a winner in this election, making it the earliest call in American history for future President of the United States of America Donald Trump. Thanks to the incredibly fast processing power of computers in this day and age, early votes were counted in record time giving the soon-to-be-President an entire extra day to get ready for his imminent Presidency. The irony of an election called so early, and what Trump would have said had it been called in Hillary’s favor about it being “rigged” is not lost on many Americans. Local pig farmer and regional pie eating champion Kenneth Bacon said of the results, “Now how about that. I was gonna go vote for Hillary tomorrow, but I suppose if it’s a lost cause I’ll just farm some extra pigs. I know when I’m beat and I see no reason to pretend it ain’t how it is!” Many analysts are perplexed by the incredibly early voter turnout in favor of Trump, citing that poll numbers just don’t seem to match up. “I guess Trump supporters are just a close-lipped bunch that keep their opinions to themselves,” said Nate Silver, an American economist and well-respected predictor of both baseball and American elections. “We just couldn’t have seen this coming. \\nTo be honest with you, I’ve lost a lot of money and am going to have quite a bit of egg on my face when I get into the office tomorrow.” \\nEven if every person that hasn’t voted yet in the country rushed out and voted right this minute, Hillary could still not possibly win, meaning those of us that haven’t voted can just sit back and relax. Especially Trump supporters. \\nWhen reached for comment about the victory, Trump had few words, saying only, “Now that I’ve won I’m not going to just sit back and rest on my laurels. I’m going to get out there and start doing my damnedest to make America great again, just like I promised.” '],\n",

       " ['Bush Admin Just Got Involved In FBI’s Probe Into Clinton’s Emails And It’s Game Changing (IMAGE) – New Century Times',\n",
       "  \"Share on Facebook \\nWhen you imagine partisan government overreach, it’s hard not to think about the Bush administration, especially when it comes to ignoring the law to accomplish their goals (think “enhanced interrogation”). When they tell the FBI they’ve gone too far, well, the FBI had better listen. \\nIn an Op-Ed in the New York Times , Richard Painter, George W. Bush’s White House ethics lawyer from 2005 – 2007, wrote about his problems with the FBI’s latest investigation of Hillary Clinton and, most surprisingly, he’s taking legal action to stop it. According to Painter, it’s an abuse of power. \\n(I)t would be highly improper, and an abuse of power, for the F.B.I. to conduct such an investigation in the public eye, particularly on the eve of the election. It would be an abuse of power for the director of the F.B.I., absent compelling circumstances, to notify members of Congress from the party opposing the candidate that the candidate or his associates were under investigation. It would be an abuse of power if F.B.I. agents went so far as to obtain a search warrant and raid the candidate’s office tower, hauling out boxes of documents and computers in front of television cameras. \\nThe F.B.I.’s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. \\nBeyond that, Painter says it’s against the law, the Hatch Act in particular, to try to influence the outcome of an election. On that basis, Painter is taking action. George W. Bush's ethics lawyer filed a complaint yesterday against the FBI for violations of the Hatch Act. Via NYT: https://t.co/cXbs2xFYxj pic.twitter.com/3FbVRCPTyi \\n— Nick Gourevitch (@nickgourevitch) October 30, 2016 \\nAnd that is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers’ ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. \\nThe Hatch Act specifically prohibits government officials, with the exception of the President, the Vice President and a handful of others from engaging in political activities. Painter is particularly concerned about the fact that FBI director James Comey has made comments about Hillary Clinton in the past, such as his statement that Clinton’s handling of classified information was “extremely careless.” \\nWhat seems “extremely careless” is the way Comey has handled this investigation. \\nOn Friday, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, sent to members of Congress a letter updating them on developments in the agency’s investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s emails, an investigation which supposedly was closed months ago. This letter, which was quickly posted on the internet, made highly unusual public statements about an F.B.I. investigation concerning a candidate in the election. The letter was sent in violation of a longstanding Justice Department policy of not discussing specifics about pending investigations with others, including members of Congress. According to some news reports on Saturday, the letter was sent before the F.B.I. had even obtained the search warrant that it needed to look at the newly discovered emails. And it was sent days before the election, at a time when many Americans are already voting. \\nPainter notes that Comey’s intent doesn’t matter. He violated the rules simply by taking the actions that could influence the election and frankly, there was no reason for Comey to release those emails, which aren’t even directly tied to Clinton, now. \\nHe finished his op-ed with a dire warning to Americans: \\nThis is no trivial matter. We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power. Allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more, and even worse, abuses of power in the future. \\nPainter isn’t alone in sharing this concern about Comey. Before these latest emails, Politico published an op-ed comparing Comey to the notorious J. Edgar Hoover , who was the first FBI director, who was perhaps best known for using questionable tactics to bring down dissidents. \\nSince taking office, Comey has repeatedly injected his views into executive branch deliberations on issues such as sentencing reform and the roots of violence against police officers. He has undermined key presidential priorities such as crafting a coherent federal policy on cybersecurity and encryption. Most recently, he shattered longstanding precedent by publicly offering his own conclusions about the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email. (The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.) \\nIt would be difficult to argue—in terms of temperament, manner, or motivation—that he is, or ever will be, the next J. Edgar Hoover. But increasing numbers of critics believe he has displayed a worrying disregard for the rules and norms that have constrained all but one of his predecessors, straying with blithe confidence—and with increasing regularity—across the fine line that separates independence from unaccountability. \\nIf nothing else, this election year has shown us something completely unprecedented and completely undemocratic. It’s not just that Comey is influencing the election, he’s using emails stolen by a foreign government to influence an election. As Donald Trump says, this is “ worse than Watergate ,” just not in the way Trump thinks. \"],\n",

       "  'By Amanda Froelich at trueactivist.com\\nDuring a standoff between riot police and peaceful protesters, a herd of buffalo appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp.\\nYesterday, tensions between law enforcement workers and peaceful protestors with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe escalated. A series of standoffs resulted in “protectors” being maced, shot with rubber bullets, tasered, and even attacked with sound and concussion cannons. Ultimately, 117 people were arrested in the plight to stop the four-state Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) from being constructed.\\nAfter months of similar struggle to protect sacred burial grounds and the Missouri river, opposers of the DAPL were blessed today when a herd of buffalo appeared from nowhere. While mass arrests, macing, and beatings from batons took place, a stampede of bison appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp. Reportedly, a cry of joy erupted from the crowd, as protectors have been praying for help from the American bison (known as Tatanka Oyate) during their standoff with riot police and national guardsmen.\\nAs UsUncut relays , the Native American culture honors the Tatanka Oyate as a symbol of sacrifice. Its appearance is reportedly being hailed as a gift from the Great Spirit.\\nDespite impressive attention being given to the protesting of the Dakota Access Pipeline by alternative media sites , activists on the frontlines, and even celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Shailene Woodley , little is being done in Washington D.C. The tribal leaders are calling on state and federal governments to respect the constitutional rights of water protectors and to stop the mistreatment of the indigenous who assert their ownership of the land due to a 1881 treaty.'],\n",
       " ['Should Christians Celebrate Halloween?',\n",
       "  'Whether or not Christians should celebrate Halloween has been a controversial topic for decades. Some view dressing up, eating candy and enjoying the festivities harmless and innocent, while others view it as an offense to their faith. Americans spend nearly $6.9 billion yearly making it the second largest commercial holiday in the country. As commercialized as the celebration has become, many of its roots are completely paganist. Is this a cause for Christians to avoid the entire celebration?\\nThis is a time of year filled with debate, but not necessarily politics. Many Christians are convinced that Halloween is a satanic holiday while the rest of the world has found their sweet spot complete with costumes and candy. Children and adults have the opportunity to dress in accordance with their imagination, confirming from its haunted history to modern festivities, this holiday is a big deal. With decorations, candy, parties, and costumes, the average American spends up to $75 in the spirit of celebration.\\nHalloween is the holiday that links the seasons of fall and winter. Reportedly, it originated with one of the ancient Celtic festivals; an event where people would wear various costumes and light bonfires in hopes of warding off roaming ghosts. However, by the late 1800s, Americans shifted the theory of Halloween into a holiday centered on community and fun events. The focus, for many, has transitioned from witchcraft and ghosts to neighborhood celebratory events. With the evolving of the focal point, should Christians change their stance to celebrate the holiday?\\nDespite having at least partial roots from a Christian tradition, the relationship between Halloween and Christians has long been complicated. On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther essentially started the Protestant Reformation in Wittenberg, Germany, when he nailed his 95 Theses to a door. Many of the early Christian groups that came to America rejected this holiday as pagan. The Protestant Reformation heavily influenced the Pilgrims, Puritans, Quakers, and Baptists causing the great majority to frown upon it. However, that did not prevent Halloween from finding its way to American shores.\\nIn the eighth century, Pope Gregory III dedicated November 1 as a time to honor all saints and martyrs. The holiday became widely recognized as All Saints’ Day. The evening before was known as All Hallows’ Eve, which later became Halloween. The word “hallow” originated from the Old English word for “holy” and “e’en” is an abbreviation of “evening.” As such, Halloween represented the night before All Saints Day.\\nOver time, Halloween advanced into a secular, community-based holiday branded by child-friendly activities that include costumes, neighborhood trick-or-treating, and more recently, trunk-or-treating. Along with a variety of pumpkin-flavored foods, Parties for both children and adults have become a very common way to celebrate the holiday. Some Christians still choose to lock themselves indoors with the lights off, but others have found freedom in their faith and are at liberty to decide when and how to participate.\\nIn multiple countries around the world, as the days grow shorter and the nights get colder, people continue to escort the winter season in with candy-coated gatherings and a wide range of costumes. Halloween is a celebration that allows people of all ages to participate. Nonetheless, the question remains, “Should Christians celebrate?”\\nDue to the efforts of community leaders and parents, Halloween has lost most of its illogical and religious undertones and is now more about imagination than spooky interpretation. There is nothing sinful about a Christian dressing up and participating in fun, non-threatening, celebrations. As a result, many Christians find no harm in dressing in costumes, attending parties and festivals as well as allowing their children to participate in school and local activities.\\nBy Cherese Jackson (Virginia)\\nSources:\\nHistory: Halloween\\nKidsville News: Around the World – October 2015\\nGrace to You: Christians and Halloween\\nPhoto Credits:\\nTop Image Courtesy of Billy Wilson – Flickr License\\nInline Image (1) Courtesy of Richard Vignola – Flickr License\\nInline Image (2) Courtesy of The Forum News – Flickr License\\nFeatured Image Courtesy of John Nakamura – Flickr License christianity , halloween'],\n",

       "  '\\nPosted by Matthew Bernstein | Nov 10, 2016 | Liberal Corruption Thanks To The Protestors, He’s Thinking Of Declaring Martial Law \\nIn every competition out there, there will be a winner and a loser. It’s just the way that competitions work. Literally everywhere you go there are competitions going on and there are always winners and losers. How To Make An Organic Super Food For Survial At Home - Watch Video Click Here \\nWhen we are children, we are always taught to be gracious losers. Yes sometimes losing a tough competition hurts, but if you accept it graciously, people will always praise your character. The problem with today’s young generation is that they have forgotten how to lose graciously. \\nSince the announcement that Donald Trump has won the presidential election, liberals have been protesting this victory. They’re literally ignoring everything that has been taught to them since we were children. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like the result; Trump won the election and that is a fact. \\nBut these protests continue and there is one person that seems to be the mastermind behind it. That would be the ultra liberal billionaire George Soros. He was also responsible for financing some of the protest groups that was designed to have violence at the Trump rallies. George Soros Has A Plan In Place \\nDuring the election season, it was discovered that Soros was behind some of the protestor’s actions. He was paying them to create a scene and cause violence that would have the media talking about the Trump rallies. Now this shouldn’t have been happening in the first place but it was. \\nAnd now that Trump has been elected president of the United States, there are people that are out on the streets protesting his victory. It’s a little ironic considering that liberals were the ones that were complaining about how Trump wouldn’t accept the election results if fraud was detected. \\nHere is the issue though. There are people out on the streets that are protesting a presidential election. These are the same people that were the ones inciting violence at the Trump rallies. And those people were paid by Soros to start, so it’s likely that he is the one that is paying them to start civil unrest now. \\nAnd there is a specific reason that Soros wants to have violence at the protests. That would mean that President Obama would have to declare Martial Law. This is how it works. It’s literally a domino effect. There are people out protesting the election results. Obama Might End Up Declaring Martial Law \\nBut when they start having mass amounts of violence at the protests then the entire country is going to start noticing. If that happens then there is going to be pressure on the president to solve it. President Obama would then declare Martial Law. \\nMartial Law is when the president has to suspend transfer of power due to the fact that there is a “National Emergency.” Therefore if that would happen then Trump wouldn’t be able to see the White House because Obama would still be the president of the United States. There is a good chance that this has been the back up plan for some liberals all along. \\nAnd there is proof out there that the protests are staged. There are protests going on all over the United States and in one part of the nation, Austin, Texas, they found the buses that were used to bring the people in. Again these are planned in order to create civil unrest. They Literally Found The Busses The Protestors Used \\nAnd there is more proof. The signs that the people brought to the protests were all created and printed by groups related to the Soros cause. You can’t just print thousands of signs on a whim. These events have to be planned and thought out. And that is exactly what was happening. \\nFinally the last bit of proof was that the Democrats and Soros have paid people to protest and create a disturbance at Trump events before. Since they have done it in the past, they are definitely going to do it now. And the Democrats are willing to pay them to create this disturbance. The Signs Were Created By Soros Groups \\nBut the scariest part about all this is the fact that people are actually volunteering to protest the election just because Trump won. Again we are taught from a young age to accept defeat with graciousness. Right now they are acting like a bunch of spoiled kids because they didn’t get their way. \\nAnd now there is a possibility that Obama is going to declare Martial Law because of these protestors. They couldn’t accept the fact that the country spoke and they wanted Trump in charge. But now they are actively interfering with a Democratic election because they want to complain about the choice. \\nAgain this is all most likely due to Soros. And he has had a hand in it before. He wants to see a globalized country and that means that he will do whatever he can to make it happen. That includes ordering an attack on Trump Tower in Chicago . That was where some of the protests in the country were happening. \\nBut he also had a hand in trying to fix the election. In 16 States they were using voting machines that were being produced by Soros controlled companies . Of course that meant that he was going to do what he could to rig the election. It most likely wouldn’t have mattered if you voted Trump; the machines were going to submit for Clinton. \\nShare this article to show people that Soros has a plan for all of these protests. He wants to make sure that they create enough of a civil disturbance that Obama will declare Martial Law and stop the transfer of power from him to Trump. That way the globalist agenda could still happen. \\nHowever the best option is to not engage with the people that are out there. It’s like handling a two-year-old child that is throwing a temper tantrum. If you just ignore them they will settle down. Therefore just ignore the protestors and don’t engage with them. '],\n",

       "  'Email Print A top member of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign told Clinton’s top supporters Thursday her defeat was “the most devastating loss in the history of American politics,” while campaign chairman John Podesta said the defeat was due to a pro-Donald Trump bias in the media. The remarks were made during a conference call between Clinton’s shell-shocked campaign team and several backers of Clinton’s campaign, such as donor J.B. Pritzker, Ready PAC co-founder Allida Black, and political strategist Maria Cardona. The contents of the private call were reported by The Hill , which spoke to one of the Clinton backers on the call. Clinton campaign spokesman Jennifer Palmieri didn’t mince words in describing how brutal Clinton’s upset defeat was, according to The Hill. “Thirty-six hours after the most devastating loss in the history of American politics, we’re looking at a white board right now with lots of ideas,” said Palmieri said. “We’re sort of figuring out what we need to do this week, and what we need Democrats to do in the next two months ahead of the inaugural.” Other aides, meanwhile, tried to shift blame for the shocking defeat away from the campaign and onto the media. “The media always covered her as the person who would be president and therefore tried to eviscerate her before the election, but covered Trump who was someone who was entertaining and sort of gave him a pass,” said Podesta. “We need to reflect and analyze that and put our voices forward.” Podesta also pointed a finger at FBI Director James Comey, who resurrected the matter of Clinton’s private email server in the final weekend. Podesta said the “dominance of the way [the media] covered the emails” caused them to drown out issues like Trump’s income taxes or his alleged links to Russia. The campaign’s explanations apparently didn’t do much to remedy the agony of defeat.

       "  '( ANTIWAR ) Amnesty International has issued a new statement warning that the US needs to do more to prevent civilian casualties in its coalition airstrikes in both Iraq and Syria, and cautioned the US has dramatically under-reported the number of civilians killed in their air war. The new report centered on Syria, noting that the US-led coalition had killed at least 300 civilians in Syria, and had not admitted to the vast majority of those slain. They reported the US had killed around 250 civilians just in the city of Manbij and the surrounding area.\\nThe US backed a Kurdish invasion of Manbij earlier this past summer, and conducted several major airstrikes in the surrounding areas, including some which killed scores of civilians. As Amnesty pointed out, the US has not officially included any civilians from the Manbij strikes on their official count, despite the incidents being well established.\\nAmnesty warned that the lack of official recognition raised concerns that the US had not made any corrections to their policy, and that this was particularly concerning with the ongoing invasion of the city of Mosul, which is many times larger and expected to be an even longer conflict.\\nThe Pentagon has only acknowledged a few dozen civilian deaths in both Iraq and Syria combined.

(Ross and Navarro seem to be unaware that to “eliminate our trade deficit” – such as was done, for example, during the Great Depression – is to eliminate net contributions by foreigners to increasing the size of America’s capital stock.)\\nBut Trump’s most absurd promise is to enrich Americans by increasing exports and reducing imports. Imports are what we voluntarily buy and exports are the price we pay. Therefore, a policy meant to increase exports while decreasing imports is a policy meant to force Americans to pay more to foreigners and to receive less in return – a decidedly unartful deal the architect of which would deserved to be fired.\\nBut the Trump camp’s confusion runs even more deeply. Exporting for Americans is worthwhile only because it supplies us with the means to purchase imports, either currently or in the future. So a policy that aims both to increase exports and to decrease imports is akin to a policy that aims both to increase people’s spending power and to decrease it. It’s a policy meant to give Americans greater means for acquiring imports as it simultaneously strips Americans of the freedom to use those means. It’s the economic policy equivalent of an attempt to square a circle.\\nSincerely,\\nDonald J.

       "  '0 66 \\nA source at MSNBC’s Morning Joe confirms that the newly-elected Trump has made a decision regarding Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Source tells @Morning_Joe @realDonaldTrump won’t pursue investigations into @HillaryClinton for private email server use/Clinton Foundation. \\n— Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) November 22, 2016 \\nDespite all his campaign bluster, when he was calling Clinton “crooked Hillary” and promising that Clinton would “be in jail” once he was president, it seems Trump has had a change of heart. It seems like only a month ago that Donald Trump told his supporters that: \\n‘This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I’ve ever seen involving justice in the United States — in the history of the United States.’ \\nIn fact, it was only a month ago. Trump promised his bloodthirsty supporters that he would “lock her up” as president, and just six weeks ago Trump promised during the second presidential debate that he would appoint a “special prosecutor” to look into Hillary Clinton’s “situation” regarding her use of a private email server. \\nFive days after being elected, Trump did one of the most rapid walkbacks in presidential history when asked about that “special prosecutor” to throw Hillary Clinton in prison. When asked by 60 Minutes interviewer, Lesley Stahl, about his plans for the former secretary of state, Trump balked. \\n‘I don’t want to hurt them. I don’t want to hurt them. They’re, they’re good people. I don’t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.’ \\nThe same man who fanned the flames with supporters who called Clinton a “criminal” and “evil,” who exploited women who claimed that they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and laughed at as a child rape victim by Hillary Clinton, now wants the American public to know that Bill and Hillary Clinton are “good people.” \\nOf course, it was never in question whether or not Hillary Clinton would be convicted of a crime or sentenced to prison, since multiple investigations by GOP-led committees regarding Benghazi and two investigations by the FBI regarding the private email server that Clinton and every modern predecessor of hers used turned up no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. \\nJust like every other promise Trump made on the campaign trail to attract voters with vengeance and hatred on their minds, it was all just smoke and mirrors. \\nFeatured image via Getty/Chip Somodevilla Share this Article!

       "  '0 - items Only Geniuses & Schizophrenics Can Pass This 3 Question Quiz! \\nMany neuroscientists estimate that as much as 98% of all brain activity is unconscious. Just think about that for a second – 98%. \\nAll that unconscious activity is influenced heavily by the world around its subconscious cues. To demonstrate that, we’re going to call on a super cool quiz. The premise is simple; only geniuses and schizophrenics can answer the following three questions. Which one are you? Continue to find out! \\nThere are no hints! You either know it or you don’t! \\nThe test you’ve just done relies on what researchers call the ‘contraposition method.’ This method tests the extent of a person’s awareness and brain processing power. It’s a super complicated method with tons of ‘moving parts,’ so to speak, but here’s what you need to know for the purpose of this article: There are objects which one can reasonably say are unrelated. Most people would assume, for example, that a race car and a hurricane have very little connection. A genius who thinks outside of the box, however, would deduce some sort of connection. A schizophrenic patient would also deduce a connection because of the way the illness makes people see non-existent connections in just about everything. In other words, if the quiz in this article left you scratching your head, you’re normal. If not, one of two things is true – you’re brilliant, or you have schizophrenia. \\nDon’t worry, I won’t leave you guessing. Here are some facts that will help you figure out which one you are: Geniuses will have taken their time to think before blurting a response. Did you get the answers right? What do you think – are you a schizophrenic or a genius? As far as the schizophrenia angle goes, this post is not a diagnostic tool. It can get you thinking about schizophrenia and, if you have concerns, you can see a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation. \\nSources: '],\n",

       "  'Getty - Michael Loccisano, Mike Nelson \\nDespite the fact that Hillary Clinton is the one running for president, as the election looms ever closer, new details continue to emerge about former President Bill Clinton — particularly regarding his alleged affairs and sexual assaults. \\nGennifer Flowers has long claimed that she engaged in a consensual affair with the former president while he was still governor of Arkansas. The affair lasted some 12 years, according to Flowers, who refers to her former boss as “the love of her life.” \\nWhen she first went public with allegations of the affair, she provided the press with a series of tape-recorded phone calls as evidence. But there was something else in that alleged audio, something that was all but overlooked until Flowers gave a new interview this past week to Breitbart\\'s Aaron Klein. \\nIn the midst of several conversations regarding a lawsuit alleging that Clinton had engaged in numerous affairs, Flowers also recorded a brief exchange referencing her job. \\nThe job wasn\\'t anything special on the surface — a clerical position working for the state of Arkansas, making around $17,000 per year. Flowers secured the job just over a year prior to Clinton\\'s run for the presidency. \\nBut prior to getting the job, Flowers sent a letter in which she told Clinton about her financial troubles. The National Memo reported on the contents of that letter: \\n\"Gennifer wrote Clinton again on February 25. \\'Since we were unable to connect by phone,\\' the letter began, \\'I thought I should drop you a note.\\' Flowers complained that Gaddy hadn’t been very successful in helping her and that her financial situation was dire. She enclosed a copy of her lawyer’s letter threatening to sue the radio station, and closed by asking Clinton to \\'Please, be in touch.\\' \\nThree months later, Gaddy sent Flowers to the Arkansas Merit System to be tested for an administrative assistant position that paid $17,524.\" \\nAs Clinton prepared his campaign for the presidency, he and Flowers spoke again on the phone — after a woman in her office had complained that she was more qualified for the job — and Flowers again allegedly recorded their conversations : \\nGF – But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It’s just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, “Well, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,” and then uh, “they told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there.\" \\nBC – Good for you. \\nGF – Well the only thing that concerns me, where I’m, where I’m concerned at this point is the state job. \\nBC – Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you’ve just been looking for one, you’d uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you’d talked to me about it, you can say no. \\nGF – Well and I would. But I’m… here is the thing I’ve got to consider, too, is I’ve gotta go in there to work every day. You know what I mean? \\nBC – Yep. \\nGF – And if, and if these people start talking or someone in the press… \\nBC – Well, have they been nice to you there? \\nGF – Yeah they have been. But I don’t, you know, I mean, I just want you to know what’s going on. And I’ll be glad to hang in there. \\nBC – Has the, has the… \\nGF – But if it gets real… \\nClinton did eventually admit to having sexual relations with Flowers, though he insisted there had only been a single encounter. \\nFlowers, who has never been a fan of Hillary Clinton\\'s, has come out in recent months in support of Donald Trump. She was one of the women Trump invited to sit in the front row during the debates in an effort to make the Clintons uncomfortable. \\nYou can listen to Klein\\'s interview with Flowers below: '],\n",
       " [\"The shortest and most powerful explanation of Trump's victory I have ever seen\",\n",
       "  'Zach Cartwright | November 11, 2016 \\nThe Democrats’ staggeringly piss-poor performance Tuesday night resulting in Donald Trump’s victory can be summed up in one word: Turnout. \\nHillary Clinton would have won had she focused her message more on appealing to white, working-class voters in rust belt states like Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. As this New York Times map of the 2012 election shows, President Obama won all of those states in 2012. Obama also won roughly 2.6 million more votes than Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Donald Trump’s narrow margin of victory in the Electoral College was only possible by winning all of the aforementioned rust belt states . \\nThere was hardly any enthusiasm behind Hillary Clinton when examining exit poll results. In an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos exit polling, Times writer Sarah Jaffe found several revealing trends showing why Clinton was a poor choice for the Democrats in terms of motivating voters to get to the polls and cast their ballots for their party’s nominee: \\n75 percent of respondents agreed “America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.” Only slightly fewer agreed that “the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,” and — perhaps the kicker — 68 percent believed that “traditional parties and politicians don’t care about people like me.” \\nThe numbers bear out that argument — Clinton’s turnout was lower than Obama’s turnout in both 2008 and 2012, even though she still won the popular vote this year. No matter how you slice it, Clinton wasn’t enough of a draw to make the difference, particularly in key states like Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — states Obama won in 2012. As the Washington Post reported, three traditionally blue states Trump won in 2016 that Obama won in 2012 — Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — Clinton got between 5 and 15 percent fewer votes than Obama. \\nThe Democratic primaries were a harbinger of things to come in a general election matchup featuring Clinton and Trump. As US Uncut reported in March, Hillary Clinton’s victories in the March 1 Super Tuesday primaries all depended on voter turnout numbers lower than 2008 figures — the last time there was a contested Democratic primary. In all seven states Clinton won that day, each state had turnout anywhere between 4 percent and 50 percent lower than in 2008 . \\nThe data makes the argument all by itself. No amount of scapegoating heaped on Jill Stein supporters can explain Hillary Clinton losing traditional Democratic strongholds that Obama won not only once, but twice . In Detroit, Michigan, for example, Hillary Clinton got roughly 120,000 fewer votes than President Obama in 2012. Those votes made the difference in securing Trump’s victory, as Clinton lost Michigan by roughly half that number. \\nFormer Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell — one of the most senior officials within the Democratic Party apparatus — argued in a radio interview that even though Hillary Clinton was beloved by Democratic Party leadership, Bernie Sanders would have likely prevailed among the white, working-class rust belt constituency specifically due to his anti-establishment message. \\n“It would be interesting to think of how Bernie Sanders would’ve done. Bernie Sanders would’ve lost a few Republicans who voted for Hillary because of some of his economic views but he would’ve fought Donald pretty hard for those disaffected, angry, and frustrated workers,” Rendell said on 1210 WPHT in Philadelphia. \\nHad the Democratic Party nominated a candidate more attuned to the mood of voters in one of the most anti-establishment elections in generations, turnout could have been much higher, and America would have averted Trump’s victory. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

While winning the popular vote would not in itself guarantee a Trump victory, if IBD / TIPP is once again accurate and Trump has a 2% or greater margin in the popular vote, it would far more likely than not he would also catapult above the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the Presidency. \\nIBD’s polling partner TechnoMetrica uses “traditional” telephone methodology using live interviewers for data collection for its public opinion surveys. Roughly 65% of interviews come from a cell phone sample and 35% from a Random Digit Dial (RDD) land line sample. \\nIBD’s result is a outlier if you compare it to polls conducted by network as CBS News, ABC, NBC and Fox News have Clinton up between 1 and 4% in their final pre-Election polls. \\nHowever, today’s LA Times / USC poll has Trump with an even larger 5% margin of victory. \\nWe won’t have to wait long to see which national poll ends up being right.

According to 18 U.S. Code § 594 : “Whoever intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose.” \\nThe states are allowed to regulate election procedures, so the rules vary widely. Some states allow poll watchers to help out by simply being in the room. They watch for any specific suspicious behavior. What Are Poll Watchers? \\nFor example, in Florida, each candidate is allowed to have one poll watcher at each polling place. They have to be approved by the state beforehand. \\nThe poll watcher’s job is to make sure that the votes are counted correctly and to make sure there aren’t any weird voting schemes going on. \\nAlso in Florida, the poll watchers are allowed to challenge someone’s identity if they find a problem with the person’s identification or if the voter doesn’t show up on local voter rolls. If the issue isn’t resolved on-site, then the person can fill out a “provisional” ballot. \\nThis ballot won’t get counted until the problem with the voter’s identity is cleared up, and only if the vote numbers are close enough for provisional ballots to make a difference. Unfortunately, they often don’t get counted at all and if they do, not until after the vote would’ve been useful. Who Are The Poll Workers? \\nThe poll workers are usually a combination of state employees, temporary contractors, or volunteers. They are trained to answer your questions, and they handle disputes with the poll watchers. \\nYou are allowed to ask who poll workers are and who they represent. If you have a problem while voting, you’ll report it to the poll workers. \\nPoll watchers and poll workers are not allowed to intimidate voters or suppress voting based on race, gender, national origin, or religion. They also can’t question you, and they can’t film you without your approval. \\nStay safe on election day, November 8! \\nDonald Trump has gotten himself in some hot water for calling for poll watchers: \\nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot .

       "  '0 SHARE \\nLaw enforcement and national intelligence officials have suspended Hillary Clinton’s weekly intelligence briefings after further information regarding the Democratic nominee’s use of private emails has surfaced. \\nAccording to sources familiar with the briefing process, senior officials notified the Clinton campaign on Sunday afternoon that several federal agencies “no longer believed it was either appropriate or prudent for a candidate to receive classified intelligence briefings while under a significant and ongoing investigation.” \\n“While the FBI and Department of Justice continue their independent investigations and while the law enforcement community continues to search for answers, it would be unwise to continue national security briefings amidst a very serious investigation concerning threats to national security.” \\nIt is customary for the major party nominees to receive weekly classified intelligence briefings from senior defense and intelligence officials in order for the eventual president to be fully knowledgeable on matters of national security. Both Clinton and Donald Trump have received these briefings since their respective party conventions in June. \\nOn Friday, the Director of the FBI, James Comey, notified Congress that the Bureau was effectively reopening its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while Secretary of State. Comey wrote that new emails had surfaced that led investigators to warrant further examination. \\nAccording to sources familiar with the investigation the newly-found emails were found on a device of Clinton’s personal aide Huma Abedin. Abedin is married to disgraced NY Congressman Anthony Wiener, and it is believed that the emails were discovered during an ongoing investigation into his sexting scandal. \\nThis latest revelation, including the suspension of weekly intelligence briefings, does not bode well for the former Secretary of State in the final days of a heated election. Donald Trump has seized on the news, and he is expected to continue to do so in the coming week.” \\n'],\n",

       "  \"Zach Cartwright | November 6, 2016 \\nOne of the most prolific Twitter users in the world is being denied his favorite medium of communication in the days before the election. \\nAccording to the New York Times, Donald Trump’s social media usage is being stymied by top campaign aides, in an effort to keep the Republican presidential nominee from straying off message as voters prepare to cast their ballots. Calling the revocation of Trump’s sole control over the @realDonaldTrump account an “essential move” prior to Election Day, the Times reported that Trump’s tweets are now being closely screened by top communications aide Hope Hicks , who approves every tweet before it’s fired off into the world. \\nTrump’s tweeting has previously landed him in rough waters, such as a flurry of tweets fired off at 3 AM about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who the billionaire reality TV host once referred to as “Miss Piggy” in reference to her weight gain following the pageant, and “Miss Housekeeper” in reference to her Latina upbringing. Trump also encouraged his 13 million followers to “check out” a sex tape allegedly featuring Machado. The tweets came after a debate with Hillary Clinton, who brought up her rival’s treatment of the beauty queen near the end of the 90-minute debate. Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con. \\n— Donald J.

In 2012, Trump tweeted his doubts that President Barack Obama was born in the United States, and to peddle fears about the Ebola virus. He’s also tweeted insulting remarks about prominent women in society, given unsolicited advice to celebrities about their relationships, and fired off insults at random people.

       " [\"Desperate Obama RIPS Comey: 'We Don't Operate On Innuendo' | Daily Wire\",\n",
       "  \"Desperate Obama RIPS Comey: 'We Don't Operate On Innuendo' By: November 2, 2016 \\nBarack Obama must be pretty worried. \\nEarlier this week, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told the media that FBI director James Comey’s decision to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton didn’t spring from bias or politics. He explained : \\nDirector Comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the Bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the FBI was considered by the United States Senate... they speak to his good character and the president's assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed. For example, the president doesn't believe that Director Comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election. And the president doesn't believe he's secretly supporting a candidate or political party. He's in a tough spot. He's the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties. \\nNow, with the polls closing to within the margin of error, President Obama has had second thoughts. He told NowThisNews : \\nI do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we don’t operate on innuendo and we don’t operate on incomplete information and we don’t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made. When this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasn't anything there that was prosecutable. \\nIt’s worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here – Obama’s entire administration has been built on innuendo. His Department of Justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism. His IRS used innuendo to destroy conservative 501(c)3s. His entire 2012 campaign was rooted in innuendo about Mitt Romney’s supposed secret evils. \\nBut more than anything, the Obama flip here shows serious desperation. What changed? The polls. On Monday, it looked like the FBI scandal would detract from Hillary’s polling numbers, but wouldn’t kill her. Now it looks like she might go down in flames. This shows how faithless Obama is – Comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened Hillary’s chances, at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo. \\nIf Comey has any stones, he should resign in protest at Obama’s accusations. He’s already been thrown under the bus by his commander-in-chief for not playing dead for him long enough to move Hillary into the White House. He’s got no future in his position no matter what he does. It would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell Obama and his cronies to stuff it now. Tags \"],\n",

       "  'Australian taxpayers charged over $88 million for donation to corrupt Clinton Foundation October 31, 2016 Google + They both love to play the gender card, turning their immense privilege into victim status and \\xaddividing the electorate by sex.\\nThus, Gillard nobbled Tony \\xadAbbott with her fabled misogyny speech and Clinton’s machine manages to drown out every Wikileaks embarrassment with a new Donald Trump bimbo eruption. \\nThe other thing the two ladies have in common is the Clinton Foundation , which Wikileaks emails now show is an influence-peddling political slush fund. \\nAnd guess which country was one of its biggest donors? Australia. Yep, we’re up there with Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \\nThe Australian taxpayer shovelled at least $88 million into the Clinton Foundation and associated entities from 2006 to 2014, reaching a peak of $10.3 million in 2012-13, Gillard’s last year in office. Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard both involved in the influence-peddling political slush fund that is the Clinton Foundation. \\nOn the Clinton Foundation website, AusAID and the Commonwealth of Australia score separate entries in the $10 million-plus group of donors, one rung up from American teacher unions. \\nIn 2009-10 Kevin Rudd handed over another $10 million to the foundation for climate research, part of $300 million he squandered on a Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. \\nGillard also donated $300 million of our money to the Clinton-affiliated Global Partnership for Education. \\nLo and behold, she became chairman in 2014 and has been \\xadactively promoting Clinton as president ever since — in a campaign video last December slamming Trump, in opeds trumpeting the next woman president and in appearances with Clinton spruiking girls’ education. \\nThe Abbott government topped up the left-wing organisation’s coffers with another $140 million in 2014, bringing total Australian largesse to $460 million, according to a press release from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. \\nAnd yet, apart from the beautiful friendship with Gillard, what did Australia get from the Clintons for all that cash? \\nA whole lot of trouble is what. \\nThe latest treasure trove of Wikileaks emails released last week shows that Australian green groups have been secretly funded to destroy our coal industry by environmental activists connected to the Clinton campaign. Apart from the friendship between Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard, what does Australia get from the Clinton Foundation for donating all that cash? A whole lot of trouble is what. \\nThe email account of Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta reveals extraordinary details of the sabotage of the $16 billion Adani coalmine in Queensland, which has damaged Australia’s national interest and denied cheap electricity to millions of poor Indians. \\nLast August John Hepburn, former Greenpeace activist and founder of Australian anti-coal group the Sunrise Project, sent a crowing email to his American paymasters, the Sandler Foundation, which is also a major donor to the Clinton Foundation. (Founder Herb Sandler and mate George Soros funded another Clinton-aligned progressive group, the Centre for American Progress, previously chaired by Podesta.) \\n“The Adani Carmichael mine and the whole Galilee Basin fossil fuel industrial complex is in its death throes,” Hepburn wrote in the email forwarded to Podesta. \\n“I am going to buy a few bottles of bubbly for a celebration with the (Environmental \\xadDefenders Office) legal team, our colleagues at GetUp, Greenpeace, 350.org, ECF, Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Mackay Conservation Group, Market Forces and the brilliant and tireless Sunrise team.” \\nIn another email forwarded to Podesta, Hepburn panics about an Abbott government inquiry into environmental charities and discusses hiding Sunrise’s sources of funding to safeguard its charitable tax status. \\nHepburn boasts about the latest legal blow to Adani, when the Federal Court overturned its approval and the Commonwealth Bank quit the project. \\nIn it he now wants to “escalate the campaign \\xadtowards the other 3 big Australian banks”. \\nAnd he mocks miners who “try to claim that there is some kind of foreign-funded and tightly orchestrated conspiracy to systematically \\xaddestroy the Australian coal industry. (I seriously don’t know where they get these wacky ideas from!)” \\nAs if it’s not bad enough that foreign-funded activists are meddling with our largest export earner, Podesta’s emails also detail their insidious influence on indigenous land owners who blocked the Adani mine using powerful native title rights. \\nThis alliance of green groups with native title owners is a frightening development detailed in a new book by historian Keith Windschuttle, The Break-up of Australia: The Real Agenda behind Aboriginal Recognition. \\nHe reveals the imminent expansion of native title claims, either \\xadapproved or quietly being processed, stretch across a whopping 60 per cent of the Australian continent, an area twice the size of Western Europe. \\nAlready 6000sq km of the Kidman cattle empire in the Kimberley has been given, via native title, to green activists to be converted from productive cattle country to a wildlife conservation area. \\n“In return, the Yulumbu people get a paltry $50,000 a year royalty,” Windschuttle writes. \\n“As a flora and fauna sanctuary it is economically defunct for the foreseeable future.” \\nAt worst, writes Windschuttle, the upcoming referendum for indigenous constitutional recognition, proposed by Gillard in 2012, could pave the way for a separate Aboriginal state on native title land, funded by taxation, royalties and lease payments — passive welfare in another guise. \\nAt the very least, the \\xadalliance between foreign-\\xadfunded green groups and \\xadindigenous owners gives \\xadenvironmentalists the opportunity to take whole swathes of Australia out of the productive economy and shut down industries they don’t like, from coal mines in Queensland to cattle farms in Western Australia. \\nThanks for nothing, Hillary and Julia.

       "  'Saturday 19 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree Jose Mourinho to motivate players for Arsenal match by punching them in the face \\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho is to take his confrontational style of management a stage further and prepare all his players for today’s crucial Arsenal match by punching them all squarely in the face. \\nThe news follows Mourinho’s criticism of Chris Smalling for not playing with a broken toe and Luke Shaw for having a broken leg and not being ‘brave.’ \\n“My players are all total bastards,” said the grumpy Portuguese, either as some magnificent psychological game that no one but he can understand, or as another stage in what increasingly looks like a total psychotic breakdown. \\n“I despise them for not making the goals I want, but I am Mourinho. I understand players. How to make them play better for me. \\n“I will punch them in the face. All of them. I will continue to punch them all in the face until they score all the goals I want them to. \\n“I am no longer the Special One, I am the Punchy One.” \\nPundits seemed impressed with Mourinho’s plans. \\n“The problem with players today is they’re soft-arsed, headphone shitters,” said Chris Sutton, angrily. \\n“A punch in the face would do them all the power of good. \\n“And a kick in the balls wouldn’t hurt, either. \\n“C**ts.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

       "  '18 Shares\\n17 0 0 1\\nMohsen Abdelmoumen : Don\\'t you think that we are in a continuation of the cold war between the USA and its allies in NATO on one side and China and Russia on the other, and who has interest to provoke a confrontation between these superpowers?\\nBrian Cloughley: It’s not so much a continuation as a resurrection of the Cold War. After the Warsaw Pact disbanded in March 1991, NATO, although deprived of any reason to continue in existence, managed to keep going, and in 1999 added Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to its 16 members. As the BBC noted, these countries became “the first former Soviet bloc states to join NATO, taking the alliance’s borders some 400 miles towards Russia.” With good reason Moscow wondered what on earth the US-NATO military alliance might be planning.\\nIn spite of facing no threat whatever from any country in the world, NATO continued to expand around Russia’s borders, inviting Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to join in 2002, which they did two years later.\\nAs President Putin observed in an interview with Italy’s Corriere della Sera “we are not expanding anywhere; it is NATO infrastructure, including military infrastructure, that is moving towards our borders. Is this a manifestation of our aggression?”\\nThe US is also implacably hostile to China and does what it can to provoke it in the South China Sea, but NATO has not yet ventured into Eastern waters.\\nMORE... Arise President Trump (or Why it\\'s not the End of the World as We Know it) Trump\\'s sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOP\\'s attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump, Turkey, and police tyranny: The crisis of Imperialism finds political expression There is certainly confrontation — but it was originated by the western powers at the behest of Washington. It is dangerous to indulge in military menaces, but the US appears determined to continue such a policy, and the world as a whole will certainly not benefit from its posture.\\nHow do you explain the silence of the media and Western Governments on the infamous war led by Saudi Arabia against the people of the Yemen?\\nThe most important things are money and oil. Western governments and mainstream media may from time to time make statements that “regret” the Saudi war on Yemen, but they will never take action against the Riyadh royal dictatorship that might make it cease its merciless blitz on the Yemeni people. The US State Department records that in Saudi Arabia its “citizens lack the right and legal means to change their government” while there are “pervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement and religion; and a lack of equal rights for women . . .”, but Washington takes no action to encourage the Saudi monarchy to relax or even modify its domestic tyranny.\\nSaudi Arabia is a valued ally of the United States and indulges in “torture and other abuses [and] arbitrary arrest and detention,” while “freedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law.” It might be imagined that the President of the United States might feel it proper to indicate his disapproval of the fact that in Saudi Arabia “civil law does not protect human rights, including freedom of the speech and of the press.” — but no US president will ever do anything to discourage the Saudi monarchy from continuing its domestic tyranny and murder of so many innocents in Yemen.\\nDon’t you think that, with Hillary Clinton President of the USA, we’ll have a total war, knowing that she is supported by the neocons and the military-industrial complex?\\nUnder a Clinton administration there would have been no cessation of US havoc-wreaking wars around the world, and desperate refugees would have died in their thousands. Her regime would have ensured that the Pentagon’s fleets continue to go down to the seas in confrontation, and the bombers would have streaked across the skies, deliberately provoking China and Russia. Remember that she is one of the Washington-Brussels war-drum beaters who planned the 2011 aerial blitz on Libya to destroy the government of President Gaddafi, about whose murder she giggled that “ We came; We saw; He died. ” The US-NATO attacks on Libya caused massive suffering and destruction, opened the way for feuding bands of militants to fight each other for control of parts of the country, and created a haven for the lunatic extremists of Islamic State [aka ISIS].\\nHillary Clinton has not criticised or questioned Obama’s years of aerial bombardment around the world and her foreign policy adviser, Jeremy Bash, told London’s Daily Telegraph that she would order a “full review” of US strategy on Syria as a “first key task” of her presidency, resetting the policy to emphasise the “murderous” nature of the government. He said that Mrs. Clinton would work to get Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, “out of there.”\\nPresident Assad has been selected as another target for the Clinton policy of “We came; We Saw; He died,” and his country appears doomed to a rerun of the Libya fiasco.\\nIf Hillary Clinton had become President of the United States, as seemed only too likely, there would have been even greater emphasis on global airstrikes and military confrontation. Greater turmoil, chaos and catastrophe were to come.\\nSeveral reports mention deliveries of Western arms to groups activated in Syria, weapons that ended up in the hands of terrorist groups, such as ISIS-Daesh and al-Nusra. How do you explain the miscalculation of governments that have delivered weapons to terrorists to find these weapons turned against them, as we have seen in various attacks on European soil?\\nThe US supplies weapons to many rebels and insurrectionists around the world. One of the most absurd of these supply chains was in the 1980s when they gave hundreds of Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, then had to buy them back for half a million dollars each when it was realised that the Mujahideen were about to use them against civilian airliners. The British have also supplied ground-to-air missiles to insurrectionists groups, with much less publicity but on occasions with serious results. The only explanation for the motives of western governments in doing this sort of thing is that they are poorly informed by their vastly expensive intelligence agencies.\\nThe Americans destroyed Iraq with their ally Tony Blair, Sarkozy made the same thing in Libya with David Cameron, how do you explain that these personalities are not judged, in particular via ICC, authority which judges only African despots?\\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) “investigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.” But the United States “is not at present a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court” and although Britain and France are in theory supportive of the ICC, there will never — ever — be a political leader of these countries arraigned before the Court for war crimes or anything else. The African despots it judges are no doubt guilty of heinous crimes, but they are also easy to arraign.\\nHow do you explain that Hillary Clinton\\'s candidacy was maintained while she does not stop making headlines with multiple scandals?\\nBecause the Democrat Party desperately wanted a Democrat president. Members of the Party was prepared to hold their noses with one hand to keep out the stink of Hillary’s scandals while with the other hand pressing the button to Vote Hillary.\\nIn your opinion, why do Western Governments continue to support old leaders and despotic regimes and to destabilize others according to their interests under the pretext of \"human rights\", \"democracy\", etc.? Who gave them this right?\\nNobody gave them the right to support or destroy any government, anywhere, but Western politicians and generals continues to believe that, as in the old colonial days, they have a mission to alter the lives of those they consider inferior. There is flexibility in this policy, however, because if dictators are important for the economies of the West, they are permitted to torture detainees, treat women as chattels, forbid freedom of religion and imprison critics.\\nSome of our European intelligence sources tell us that there was a mass movement of Daesh towards some countries of Northern Europe, result of the offensive on Daesh in Syria and Iraq. How do you explain that such redeployment towards Europe is possible with all the risks of attack that entails? Don’t you think that the coordination between European intelligence fails?\\nI do not believe that there has been mass movement of Daesh/IS adherents to northern Europe.\\nLibya is a terrorist sanctuary a few kilometers away from Europe. You have an experience in both military and diplomatic, how do you see the resolution of the Libyan equation, is a crisis that can only be resolved militarily or is the policy which should prevail?\\nUnlike in Saudi Arabia, for example, in Gaddafi’s prosperous Libya there was freedom of religion and women were regarded as human beings. The entire population received free education and medical care. Then the country was reduced to anarchy by the US-NATO aerial blitz of March-October 2011 (Germany refused to join in), during which, among other devastation, water and oil pipelines and pumping stations were deliberately destroyed. Militia bands took over various parts of the country and continue to fight against each other, while extremist Islamic [Wahhabi] groups have grown in size and influence and the “Government of National Accord” is powerless.\\nMany of those who energetically supported the war, such as the former secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continue to claim that it was a success — “a model intervention” — and that it is the fault of “the international community” that the country is a shambles. But even US President Obama admitted that the war on Libya “didn’t work” and that failure to have a plan for the future of the country after the murder of President Gaddafi was “the worst mistake” of his presidency.\\nGiven that the Obama presidency is in its last months, it is unlikely he will order an invasion of Libya to try to eradicate the Islamic [aka Takfiri] terrorists and rebuild the country he and his allies destroyed. He and his supporters in Europe, notably France and Britain, will continue clandestine ground operations, drone attacks and conventional airstrikes to try to assassinate extremist leaders and destroy their gangs, but these will fail. It is difficult to predict the future in Libya, other than to say that it is most likely that its people will continue suffering the appalling effects of the US-NATO war, and that there will be no peaceful resolution of its problems.\\nIs the era of the American domination a fatality? Doesn \\' t humanity may find it beneficial to see the emergence of a multipolar world ?\\nIt should be remembered that in an August 2014 interview with the New York Times President Obama said “Our participation in the coalition that overthrew Qaddafi [emphasis added] in Libya. I absolutely believed that it was the right thing to do.” The name of the game is regime change, but America, the “indispensable nation” has failed in its military adventures all over the world and has created widening instability which in turn has led to growth in extremism and terrorism. Unipolarity, with the US possessing and exercising most military power, has not worked.\\nIt appears that multipolarity might be a better alternative, with other nations restraining Washington from unilateral intervention aimed at overthrowing governments, but it is apparent that the US is determined to do all it can to prevent interference in its world domination strategies. In consequence it has engaged in a deliberate policy of confrontation with China and Russia that is entirely counter-productive and could well lead to war. Multipolarity would probably benefit humanity, but that is irrelevant to the indispensable nation.\\nWhat do you think of the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the victory of Donald Trump?\\nMr. Trump has not elucidated a foreign policy as such, and we can only hope that he will build on the positive indications he has given about America ceasing to meddle militarily all round the world. His greatest achievement would be engage in positive discussions with Russia and China, which would result in vastly diminished tension in east and west. The defeat of Clinton has meant that the threat of US international confrontation has at least diminished, because the world would have been a very dangerous place if she had got in to the White House.\\nInterview realized by Mohsen Abdelmoumen\\nWho is Brian Cloughley?\\nBrian Cloughley is a British and Australian armies’ veteran, former deputy head of the UN military mission in Kashmir and Australian defense attaché in Pakistan.\\nHe studied South Asian affairs for forty years and is South Asia defense analyst for IHS/Jane\\'s Sentinel, covering Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, updating material regularly.

Reines, Clinton’s longtime aide who served as her senior advisor while she was Secretary of State. \\nIn the same email, Reines cryptically wrote about Clinton’s email scandal that “email retention = Benghazi.” \\nThe March 3, 2015 correspondence was posted by Wikileaks after the email was ostensibly captured in John Podesta’s hacked gmail account. \\nThe message was a response to a suggestion from Clinton’s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, that Clinton make a joke about the email fiasco during a charity dinner later that day. This was two months before the State Department publicly released the first batch of Clinton’s emails, messages which had previously been provided to the House Select Committee on Benghazi . \\n“Greetings. I wanted to float idea of HRC making a joke about the email situation at the Emily’s List dinner tonight. What do folks think about that?” Palmieri asked, in an email to numerous Clinton confidantes, including Podesta and Reines. \\n“Margolis and I discussed,” replied Mandy Grunwald, a communications adviser to Clinton. “We don’t know what’s in the emails, so we are nervous about this. Might get a big laugh tonight and regret it when content of emails is disclosed.” \\nThat’s when Reines chimed in with his remarks: \\nTrust me, most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with. Read in total by America she would either win 49 states, or lose 49 states. I go back and forth. \\nI’m not hard over either way, but I would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke, because email retention = Benghazi. \\nBUT, if we could get some business done in a light way it’s worth trying: signaling that she is more than fine with them making their way into the public domain. Because past the process stuff, next phase is content. And the assumption is that she did this secretly, hiding, etc. Simply not true. We can’t jam State to release them at this point, but if Dan can think of a light way to say “I am proud of the work we did at State and hopefully at some point everyone will be able to read what’s in them as a way to better understand that work, but until then, I want to talk about…” Doesn’t need to be at the top, could be at some natural point. \\nThat’s my strong vote since I think her expressing more than a willingness for them to be released into the wild is what’s most important.

       "  '— Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) October 31, 2016 \\nRemington Research\\'s summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become \"increasingly competitive\": \\nLast week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. Trump appears to be holding strong in his must-win states and Colorado remains within the margin of error. The data also show that Pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. \\n“The presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. Hillary maintains an advantage leading in Colorado and Pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen,” said Titus Bond, Director of Remington Research Group \\nOther state polling data came out on Sunday that also showed a close-race between Trump and Clinton, although the polls were surveyed before FBI director James Comey\\'s announcement that they were re-opening their investigation against Clinton . Via RealClearPolitics : Florida: New York Times/Siena: Trump 46 percent, Clinton 42 percent. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 45 percent, Trump 44 percent. Gravis: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 47 percent. Colorado: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 42 percent, Trump 39 percent. Arizona: CBS/YouGov: Trump 44 percent, Clinton 42 percent. North Carolina: NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist: Clinton 47 percent, Trump 41 percent. Gravis: Clinton 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 45 percent. Pennsylvania: CBS News/YouGov: Clinton 48 percent, Trump 40 percent. \\nThe fact that some of these polls were close even before the Comey announcement led to this observation from FiveThirtyEight\\'s Nate Silver: Both things can be true: 1) Comey impact overblown — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 31, 2016 \\nRadio host Steve Deace writes at Conservative Review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, the renewed FBI investigation could \"have a potentially huge impact\" on Election Day: \\nTrump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Indiana, and Alaska that rarely go blue on Election Day. It’s quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the Clintons could sway the bulk of Republican-leaning undecideds Trump’s way. But that’s provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as he’s been prone to do. Then there’s the matter of Trump’s emerging Evan McMullin headache in Utah. \\nIf Trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. Those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 Electoral College votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or New Mexico where Trump is visiting during the campaign’s final week. The hope is that there’s enough voters in those states wearier of Clinton’s corruption than worried about whether Trump’s fit for office. \\nFiveThirtyEight currently has Trump\\'s odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their polls-plus forecast. This week will be crucial for Trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the FBI\\'s re-opened investigation into Clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to Election Day.

       "  '. Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his government\\x92s repeated affronts to the White House.\\nIn the past weeks alone, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last year\\x92s nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact, which bolstered Hitler; and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the \\x93ethnic cleansing\\x94 of Jews.\\nAmerican president Barack Obama, meanwhile, hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic party\\x92s candidate to succeed Mr Obama in November\\x92s election.\\nIn reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Israeli expectations of a $4.5bn-a-year deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran deal.\\nIn fact, Israel already receives roughly $3.8bn \\x96 if Congress\\x92s assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds.\\nThe deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollar\\x92s depreciation against the shekel.\\nA bigger blow still is the White House\\x92s demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry.\\nNonetheless, Washington\\x92s renewed military largesse \\x96 in the face of almost continual insults \\x96 inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog. Even The New York Times has described the aid package as \\x93too big\\x94.\\nSince the 1973 war, Israel has received at least $100bn in military aid, with more assistance hidden from view. Back in the 1970s, Washington paid half of Israel\\x92s military budget. Today it still foots a fifth of the bill, despite Israel\\x92s economic success.\\nBut the US expects a return on its massive investment. As the late Israeli politician-general Ariel Sharon once observed, \\xadIsrael has been a US \\x93aircraft carrier\\x94 in the Middle East, acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit Washington.\\nAlmost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraq\\x92s and Syria\\x92s nuclear programmes. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal.\\nIn addition, Israel\\x92s US-sponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry, the country\\x92s most powerful lobby. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East.\\nThe first F-35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December \\x96 their various components produced in 46 US states \\x96 will increase the clamour for the cutting-edge warplane.\\nIsrael is also a \\x93front-line laboratory\\x94, as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend, that develops and field-tests new technology Washington can later use itself.\\nThe US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome \\x96 which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation \\x96 it largely paid for. Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyber\\xadwarfare, such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Iran\\x92s civilian nuclear programme.\\nBut the clearest message from Israel\\x92s new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians: Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood.\\nSome believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace.\\nHopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal.\\nIf Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.\\nMr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal \\x96 he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity.\\n- See more at: http://www.jonathan-cook.net/2016-09-19/palestinians-lose-in-us-military-aid-deal-with-israel/#sthash.fL4Eq28N.dpuf Forget the FBI Cache; The Podesta Emails Show How America is Run By Thomas Frank\\nNovember 01, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" The Guardian \" - T he emails currently roiling the US presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome Anthony Weiner, but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate Washington today, the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton\\x92s campaign chair John Podesta. They are last week\\x92s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers.\\nThe class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn\\x92t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent.\\nThey are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves.\\nLet us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someone\\x92s email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that people\\x92s personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesn\\x92t seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we don\\x92t know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they aren\\x92t.\\nRepublican nominee hunkers down at Valley Forge; surrogates spread out as campaign enters final week; Clinton camp accuses FBI of double standards\\nWith all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty.\\nThe dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement.\\nCertain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillary\\x92s ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. In one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, appear to name President Obama\\x92s cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery).\\nThe far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to email Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to visit Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to \\x93learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action\\x94). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valley\\x92s seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who complains that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be:\\n\\x93 spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.\\x94\\nAttacking billionaires! In the year 2015! It was, one of the correspondents appears to write, \\x93madness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continue\\x94.\\nThere are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words \\x93Davos\\x94 or \\x93Tahoe\\x94. But it is when you search \\x93Vineyard\\x94 on the WikiLeaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us. By \\x93vineyard\\x94, of course, they mean Martha\\x92s Vineyard, the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts where presidents Clinton and Obama spent most of their summer vacations. The Vineyard is a place for the very, very rich to unwind, yes, but as we learn from these emails, it is also a place of high idealism; a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve.\\nConsider, for example, the 2015 email from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker (who then seems to have forwarded the note on to Podesta, and thus into history) expressing concern that \\x93Hillary\\x92s image is being torn apart in the media and there\\x92s not enough effective push back\\x94. The public eavesdrops as yet another financier invites Podesta to a dinner featuring \\x93food produced exclusively by the island\\x92s farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines\\x94. We learn how a Hillary campaign aide recommended that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that \\x93It wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make \\x96 but far enough ahead of Hamptons and Vineyard money events\\x94. We even read the pleadings of a man who wants to be invited to a state dinner at the White House and who offers, as one of several exhibits in his favor, the fact that he \\x93joined the DSCC Majority Trust in Martha\\x92s Vineyard (contributing over $32,400 to Democratic senators) in July 2014\\x94.\\n(Hilariously, in another email chain , the Clinton team appears to scheme to \\x93hit\\x94 Bernie Sanders for attending \\x93DSCC retreats on Martha\\x92s Vineyard with lobbyists\\x94.)\\nThen there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta \\x96 the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite \\x96 for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony.\\nThis genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. Of course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should \\x93come from the industry itself\\x94. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. Read these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one another\\x92s careers, constantly.\\nEverything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department, the banks, Silicon Valley, the nonprofits, the \\x93 Global CEO Advisory Firm \\x94 that appears to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation. Executives here go from foundation to government to thinktank to startup. There are honors. Venture capital. Foundation grants. Endowed chairs. Advanced degrees. For them the door revolves. The friends all succeed. They break every boundary.\\nBut the One Big Boundary remains. Yes, it\\x92s all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you aren\\x92t part of this happy, prosperous in-group \\x96 if you don\\x92t have John Podesta\\x92s email address \\x96 you\\x92re out.'],\n",

       " ['Punishment Is Violent And Counterproductive',\n",
       "  ' Punishment Is Violent And Counterproductive By Robert J Burrowes\\n Punishment is a popular pastime for humans. Parents punish children. Teachers punish students. Employers punish workers. Courts punish lawbreakers. People punish each other. Governments punish \\x91enemies\\x92. And, according to some, God punishes evildoers.\\nWhat is \\x91punishment\\x92? Punishment is the infliction of violence as revenge on a person who is judged to have behaved inappropriately. It is a key word we use when we want to obscure from ourselves that we are being violent.\\nThe violence inflicted as punishment can take many forms, depending on the context. It might involve inflicting physical injury and/or pain, withdrawal of approval or love, confinement/imprisonment, a financial penalty, dismissal, withdrawal of rights/privileges, denial of promised rewards, an order to perform a service, banishment, torture or death, among others.\\nGiven the human preoccupation with punishment, it is perhaps surprising that this behaviour is not subjected to more widespread scrutiny. Mind you, I can think of many human behaviours that get less scrutiny than would be useful.\\nAnyway, because I am committed to facilitating functional human behaviour, I want to explain why using violence to \\x91punish\\x92 people is highly dysfunctional and virtually guarantees an outcome opposite to that intended.\\nPunishment is usually inflicted by someone who makes a judgment that another person has behaved \\x91badly\\x92 or \\x91wrongly\\x92. At its most basic, disobedience (that is, failure to comply with elite imposed norms) is often judged in this way, whether by parents, teachers, religious figures, lawmakers or national governments.\\nBut is obedience functional or even appropriate?\\nConsider this. In order to behave optimally, the human organism requires that all mental functions \\x96 feelings, thoughts, memory, conscience, sensory perception (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste), truth register, intuition \\x96 must be developed and readily involved, without interference, in our life. If this happens, then all of these individual functions will play an integrated role in determining our behaviour in any given circumstance. This is a very sophisticated mental apparatus that has evolved over billions of years and if it was allowed to function without interference in each individual, human beings would indeed be highly functional.\\nSo where does obedience fit into all of this? It doesn\\x92t. A child is genetically programmed to seek to meet their own needs, not obey the will of another. And they will behave functionally in endeavouring to meet these needs unless terrorized out of doing so. Moreover, they will learn to meet their own needs, by acting individually in some circumstances and by cooperating with others when appropriate, if their social environment models this.\\nHowever, if a child is terrorized into being obedient \\x96 including by being punished when they are not \\x96 then the child will have no choice but to suppress their awareness of the innate mental capacities that evolved over billions of years to guide their behaviour until they have \\x91learned\\x92 what they must do to avoid being punished. For a fuller explanation of this, see \\x91Why Violence?\\x92 http://tinyurl.com/whyviolence and \\x91Fearless Psychology and Fearful Psychology: Principles and Practice\\x92. http://anitamckone.wordpress.com/articles-2/fearless-and-fearful-psychology/\\nUnfortunately, as you can probably readily perceive, this process of terrorizing a child into suppressing their awareness of what they want to do so that they do what someone else directs is highly problematical. And it leads to a virtually infinite variety of dysfunctional behaviours, even for those who appear to have been successfully \\x91socialized\\x92 into performing effectively in their society. This is readily illustrated.\\nPerhaps the central problem of terrorizing individuals into obedience of conventions, commands, rules and the law is that once the individual has been so terrorized, it is virtually impossible for them to change their behaviour because they are now terrified of doing so. If the obedient behaviours were functional in the circumstances then, apart from the obviously enormous damage suffered by the individual, there would be no other adverse social or environmental consequences.\\nUnfortunately, when all humans have been terrorized into behaving dysfunctionally on a routine basis (in the Western context, for example, by engaging in over-consumption) then changing their behaviour, even in the direction of functionality, is now unconsciously associated with the fear of violence (in the form of punishment) and so desirable behavioural change (in the direction of reduced consumption, for example) is much more difficult. It is not just that many Western humans are reluctant to reduce their consumption in line with environmental (including climatic) imperatives, they are unconsciously terrified of doing so.\\nBy now you might be able to see the wider ramifications of using violence and threats of violence to force children into being obedient. Apart from terrorizing each child into suppressing their awareness of their innate mental capacities, we create individuals whose entire (unconscious) \\x91understanding\\x92 of human existence is limited to the notion that violence, mislabeled \\x91punishment\\x92, drives socialization and society.\\nAs just one result, for example, most people consider punishment to be appropriate in the context of the legal system: they expect courts to inflict legally-sanctioned violence on those \\x91guilty\\x92 of disobeying the law. As in the case of the punishment of children, how many people ask \\x91Does violence restore functional behaviour? Or does it simply inflict violence as revenge? What do we really want to achieve? And how will we achieve that?\\x92\\nFundamentally, the flaw with violence as punishment is that violence terrifies people. And you cannot terrorize someone into behaving functionally. At very best, you can terrorize someone into changing their behaviour in an extremely limited context and/or for an extremely limited period of time. But if you want functional and lasting change in an individual\\x92s behaviour, then considerable emotional healing will be necessary. This will allow the suppressed fear, anger, sadness and other feelings resulting from childhood terrorization to safely resurface and be expressed so that the individual can perceive their own needs and identify ways of fulfilling them (which does not mean that they will be obedient). For an explanation of what is required, see \\x91Nisteling: The Art of Deep Listening\\x92 which is referenced in \\x91My Promise to Children\\x92. https://nonviolentstrategy.wordpress.com/strategywheel/constructive-program/my-promise-to-children/\\nSo next time you hear a political leader or corporate executive advocating or using violence (such as war, the curtailment of civil liberties, an economically exploitative and/or ecologically destructive initiative), remember that you are observing a highly dysfunctionalized individual. Moreover, this dysfunctional individual is a logical product of our society\\x92s unrelenting use of violence, much of it in the form of what is euphemistically called \\x91punishment\\x92, against our children in the delusional belief that it will give us obedience and hence social control.\\nOr next time you hear a public official, judge, terrorist or police officer promising \\x91justice\\x92 (that is, retribution), remember that you are listening to an emotionally damaged individual who suffered enormous violence as a child and internalized the delusional message that \\x91punishment works\\x92.\\nYou might also ponder how bad it could be if we didn\\x92t require obedience and use punishment to get it, but loved and nurtured children, by listening to them deeply, to become the unique, enormously loving and powerful individuals for which evolution genetically programmed them.\\nI am well aware that what I am suggesting will take an enormous amount of societal rethinking and a profound reallocation of resources away from violent and highly profitable police, legal, prison and military systems. But, as I wrote above, I am committed to facilitating functional human behaviour. I can also think of some useful ways that we could allocate the resources if we didn\\x92t waste them on violence.\\nIf you share this commitment and working towards this world appeals to you too, then you are welcome to consider participating in the fifteen-year strategy outlined in \\x91The Flame Tree Project to Save Life on Earth\\x92 http://tinyurl.com/flametree and to consider signing the online pledge of \\x91The People\\x92s Charter to Create a Nonviolent World\\x92. http://thepeoplesnonviolencecharter.wordpress.com\\nPunishment can sometimes appear to get you the outcome you want in the short term. The cost is that it always moves you further away from any desirable outcome in the long run.\\nRobert J. Burrowes has a lifetime commitment to understanding and ending human violence. He has done extensive research since 1966 in an effort to understand why human beings are violent and has been a nonviolent activist since 1981.

It is vital to ask before Tuesday were Barack and Michelle two of the friends enriched by the corruption that flowed from the Clinton Foundation? \\nDuring the time of Hillary Clinton’s corruption at work, Obama did not just keep looking the other way, he actually corresponded with Clinton on her private basement server under a fake name of. \\nHow like him to operate under a fake name as that’s what he’s been doing since 2008! \\nWhere’s the forensic investigation to tell us how much money has been siphoned off to the bank accounts of Barack and Michelle Obama through the Clinton Foundation? \\nStanding in for the MIA mainstream media, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh is asking the questions the voting public need need answered: \\n“Have the Clintons been selling United States foreign policy? \\n“Have the Clintons been engaging in pay for play? Meaning: You pay them and they’ll play ball with you by giving you policy considerations or what have you.” Have the Clintons been selling United States foreign policy? Engaging in pay for play? \\n“There is little doubt in the layman’s world that that has been going on. Proving it is quite another matter, but there’s little doubt, especially in the political world. There’s no doubt in my mind that that’s what’s been going on and that’s why she set up the server in the first place. The entire reason for the server in her basement was not because she wanted privacy per se. It’s not because she wanted convenience. It’s not because she didn’t want to go to the hassle of having a StateDepartment.gov email address. It’s not because she didn’t trust people. ( Rush Limbaugh Nov. 3, 2016) \\n“The reason she set up the server in her basement was specific, and it was to be able to conduct business for the foundation and keep those emails from ever being seen by anybody, including Freedom of Information Act requests. And what the Clintons have been doing via their foundation is where the real criminality is. There’s negligence and intent over on the email server side with classified data being trafficked and so forth. But over here at the foundation, that is where the Clintons have been engaging…” \\nThere can be little doubt that Obama’s a valued player of the Bill, Hillary, Huma and Anthony Weiner baseball team. \\nIndeed we can see for ourselves that the Obamas are proud of what Hillary has done in the shocking and revolting pay-for-play game. Both president and First Lady have been out on the campaign trail telling Americans Hillary’s the ONLY option for president. \\nIn praising his former Secretary of State, Obama has been telling outright lies, including the whopper that “the fate of the world is teetering” because of Donald J. Trump. \\n“The fate of the world is teetering” because Obama seeks to kill off all life for Western society. \\nHow conniving Obama is in his ‘Elect Hillary’ stumping: \\n“You know what?

And as a consequence, sometimes she’s underappreciated here at home,” he said. “But she made me a better president,” Obama told an audience of university students in Chapel Hill, N.C. \\n“Obama became most animated, and spent the most time, on the topic of Trump – a person he views as an existential threat to not only his legacy, but the world. \\n“I am not on the ballot.

Part of that learning curve teaches children to never lie. These children grow up into successful, trustworthy adults, right? How To Make An Organic Super Food For Survial At Home - Watch Video Click Here \\nLawyers, doctors, government officials, and so on are all supposed to be upstanding citizens. They are supposed to represent truth and freedom for our nation. \\nWhere there is great responsibility, there is also opportunity to abuse this power. Hillary Clinton’s appointed chairman, John Podesta, is familiar with this all too well. \\nTruth seeker and founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has released Hillary Clintons deleted emails from her private server to make Americans aware of what’s going on. \\nIn a world where it’s difficult to tell what’s right and what’s wrong anymore, its natural to feel fear. However, “fear” is what people like Hillary Clinton thrive on. \\nThe FBI is revisiting the initial Clinton email scandal and has provided newly declassified information about the Clinton Foundation via the FBI Vault . \\nIn an email sent to Cheryl Mills from John Podesta the evening of March 2, 2015, hours after the New York Times reported that Clinton possibly violated federal record requirements by using the private server, a shocking revelation has been uncovered. \\nAccording to the latest batch of Podesta’s hacked emails, Podesta writes, “Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later.” \\nMills responded, “Think you just got your new nick name.” \\nThe “Lanny” reference is to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to former President, Bill Clinton. Lawyers, unfortunately, are not always the most honest individuals and have been known to cover up for their guilty clients. Hillary Clinton is one of these lawyers. \\nCheryl Mills is the same woman who oversaw the controversial construction of a South Korean sweat shop being built in Haiti. A week after this email exchange took place, Hillary Clinton announced that she would love nothing more than to share her emails with the general public, claiming she had nothing to hide. At least, she didn’t think she did. \\nAfter being subpoenaed by federal court, Hillary Clinton acid-washed her private server, deleting thousands of emails. She denied, under oath, that classified information was ever on the server or sent/discussed via her private email address. Do you think Hillary Clinton ever gets tired of lying, each lie covering up the next? \\nAcid-washing a server costs a pretty penny. If she truly had nothing to hide, why did she completely bleach her server free of everything? \\nThanks to leaked emails from WikiLeaks, it has been proven that Hillary lied when she said no classified information had ever been involved with her private server- Not only was there classified information stored and talked about, but hackers were able to intercept the data and correspondence. \\nNew York Post comments, “Democrats on the House Oversight Committee point to Clinton tweeting on March 4, 2015, calling on the State Department to release her 55,000 pages of work files.” \\n“I want the public to see my email,” Hillary wrote two days after the Podesta message. \\nAt the time, the real Lanny Davis was in support of Clinton addressing her emails. \\nAnother WikiLeaks email displays members of the Clinton Organization getting frustrated with Davis’ public voicing. \\n“We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe,” campaign manager Robby Mook wrote Podesta March 8, 2015. “Can’t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.” \\nGood thing for Lanny Davis, “zap” doesn’t equate to “wet-work.” \\nAlthough Davis may have been rash to announce and support Hillary Clinton’s innocence, the DNC had major issues with it. \\nDavis told Fox News host Chris Wallace, during a televised interview, about Hillary Clinton’s private email server- “there can be a neutral party to review all these records – nothing unlawful.” \\nApparently, Davis wasn’t given the memo by Hillary Clinton’s team regarding her bleached server and it’s true contents. \\n“I think it is a reasonable idea if anybody has any doubts that there’s a delete on a hard drive- to have an independent go inspect her private e-mail?” Davis added. \\nHillary Clinton is known for lying, her own chairman doesn’t even believe her when she claims she “forgets” things. Even Podesta Knows She Is A Liar \\nHillary Clinton wouldn’t know honesty if it slapped her in the face. She is a psychopathic liar that thirsts for ways to obscenely scam on a global spectrum. \\nShe calls out Donald Trump for “using the system” but in no way has he abused the system in the grand scale that the Clintons have. He’s a business man, he was simply following the laws that government had implemented. \\nFloods of emails and documents are being leaked every day by Anonymous, WikiLeaks and the FBI. These are desperate cries for help mostly from whistle blowers who have been intimately involved with the government, trying to warn American citizens of certain madness and despair that awaits us if Hillary Clinton wins presidency. \\nDonald J. Trump genuinely cares for the American people. He is a natural leader, he enjoys helping people because he believes in bettering America, not policies that encourage ‘pay for play’. \\nHillary Clintons transparency is starting to become blurred. Shatter the busted deception and lock everyone involved with the Clinton scandals in prison. \\nDonald Trump recognizes the need for America to rebuild, which starts with depleting government corruption and replacing government officials. This is something Hillary could never accomplish. Hillary Clinton would just hire her friends and abuse her position of power, as she’s done for nearly four decades. \\nJohn Podesta suggested that Hillary Clinton delete her emails- he must believe she is capable of worse than sharing classified information and as president of the United States, who would stop her from committing even more crime? She would put each and every one of our lives on the line and not think twice. \\nJohn Podesta doesn’t even believe in her, why should America? '],\n",

       "  ' The Vision Thing\\nBy Paul Edwards\\nThat this election is an abysmal disgrace is nationally acknowledged; that it is absolutely unique is not, although it\\x92s undeniable. Never before has virtually the entire mainstream media avidly, emphatically endorsed one Presidential candidate while furiously, contemptuously vilifying the other. Never has a sitting President joined in general denunciation of a candidate. With ten days to go it\\x92s affirmed by most key sources that Donald Trump can\\x92t win and Hillary Clinton will. Many pundits predict a landslide for her. Assume it. What then? The most hated President-elect ever will not be loved by the Congress she will confront. Even with a majority in the Senate--just possible--and in the House--not--prospects for a legislative agenda, should she have one, are non-existent. What Obama\\x92s phony charm failed to achieve, Hillary\\x92s lack of it will scarcely obtain. This presages four more years of stasis and nullity, of social and economic rot, financial chicanery, and national decay. As regards the composition of the Supreme Court--the panicky Liberal pitch for being \\x93with her\\x94--unless she nominates hidebound conservatives, which is probable, not a single selection will be confirmed during her term. So... paralysis in Congress, reaction in the Court; two limbs of government neutralized, gives us rule by a disliked, distrusted figurehead with the full power of Wall Street and the Imperial War-loving Establishment behind her. What then will be accomplished? First, the interests of The Empire will be promoted at least as robustly as in Obama\\x92s eight years of sycophancy. Including his Rube Goldbergian Obamacare, still foundering and gouging, nothing of any benefit to Americans was achieved under this charlatan who perfected the skill of describing an airplane crash as a triumph of gravity. So what will she do in office? Well, start with what she won\\x92t do. She won\\x92t make any effort to restrain The Big Casino, the Gold Sacks Mafia. They made her an offer she couldn\\x92t refuse. She won\\x92t attempt any closing of the inequality gap. That would entail clipping her base--\\x94Our Crowd\\x94 of the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills. She won\\x92t meddle with Sick Care--\\x94fool me once...\\x94--or, corporate tax enforcement. Her Big Donors don\\x92t want to pay them and why should they, right? She can just let Labor die of its own raging leukemia. College grads have to stay in their parents\\x92 basements and service their college debt via Macdonalds because Arbeit Macht Frei. No need to do anything about Global Warming so long as you denounce it boldly at international meetings. Best leave the environment in the hands of those who can turn idle nature into money. Besides, the solution to pollution is dilution and clearcuts grow back in a millenium or so. On the minor agenda, she knows there are still small poor countries who require our R2P and cluster bombs. Others have resources that, with the odd military coup or assassination, should come on line nicely. Africa, say, has low-hanging fruit, and the Latin American mess needs our firm hand to prevent Lefty dictators diverting perfectly good profits to their own societies. Turning to the major crises, Exceptionalism requires that they be made far bigger. Our Defense Industries can\\x92t be expected to muck along forever on paltry brushfire wars: Iraq, Afghanistan--though in fairness they\\x92ve profuced steady income streams--and Libya, no bonanza, and Syria, which Putin\\x92s diabolical meddling prevented blossoming as we hoped. Still, there\\x92s no earthly reason we can\\x92t achieve a profitable Third World War simply by refusing to take the bait of Satanic Putin\\x92s wimpy peace offers and calling them what they really are: a mortal threat to our Capitalist System. So much for her first Hundred Days. Beyond the panicked cheerleading of the Imperial Elite--those that the late, great George Carlin referred to as \\x93your owners\\x94--and their failing organs of crowd manipulation, and beyond the day Clinton takes office if their hopes are consummated, America faces a cataclysmic crisis of governance; one of the order of magnitude of the secession of The South under Lincoln. Clinton and Trump are the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of that crisis. Our dead system must, and will, have catharsis. Which of them precipitates it may not greatly matter. Or it may mean everything.

       " ['Jackboots! Heavily Militarized Police Caught Red Handed In Collaboration With Oil Companies -',\n",
       "  'Via Alternet \\nToday’s militarized crackdown on water protectors in Cannonball, North Dakota stems from high levels of coordination between the extractive industry, state officials and police departments. It was waged against a frontline camp seeking to block the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which would cross beneath the Standing Rock Sioux reservation’s main drinking water source and bisect the community’s burial grounds. The attack took place under cover of a media blackout, with reports emerging that police were disrupting cellular phone reception. \\nWater protectors have already endured dog attacks, military-style checkpoints, low-flying surveillance planes, invasive strip searches, national guard deployments, and mass arrests. “What’s happening today is a travesty on the human rights of Indigenous people,” Tom Goldtooth, the executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, told AlterNet. “I see this as glaring evidence that the law enforcement of this county and state is more concerned about protecting corporate rights of the extractive industry than tribal nations.” \\nThere is evidence of close coordination between the companies backing the $3.8 billion crude-oil Dakota Access Pipeline and police departments. Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company for Dakota Access LLC, said Tuesday it intends to work with police to forcibly clear a frontlines water protectors’ camp. Energy Transfer Partners threatened that “in coordination with local law enforcement and county/state officials, all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land.” \\nChallenging the company’s charges of trespassing, the frontline Sacred Stone Camp says it is taking back “unceded territory affirmed in the 1851 Treaty of Ft. Laramie as sovereign land under the control of the Oceti Sakowin.” \\n“We have never ceded this land,” Joye Braun, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said in a press statement. “If DAPL can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land, then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland.” \\nToday’s events indicate that Energy Transfer Partners is not bluffing when it says police are siding with the company. In fact, law enforcement has vocally rallied behind the pipeline, which is backed by Enbridge. “At some point the rule of law has to be enforced,” Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. “We could go down there at any time. We’re trying not to.” \\nThe companies backing the pipeline already have private security under their employ. Dakota Access LLC confirmed to AlterNet in September that it had hired the notorious multinational security firm G4S during a period that overlapped with the protests, but would not state where its forces were located. Attorneys representing the Standing Rock encampments identified the companies behind the Dakota Access company’s brutal dog attacks, captured on video, as private security firm 10-Code Security, LLC and attack dog contractor Frost Kennels. \\nBut according to Peter Kraska, professor and author of Militarizing The American Criminal Justice System: The Changing Roles of the Armed Forces and Police , the extractive industry also has taxpayer-funded security, in the form of police. \\n“We have romantic notions of the relationships between government and the private sector and tend to think the old days of police supporting owners of capital—the railroad companies instead of the workers—are from a bygone era,” Kraska told AlterNet. “Situations like these show that corporations and energy interests are exercising a monopoly on violence to continue the fossil fuel industry unabated.” \\nSteven Salaita, professor and author of the forthcoming book Inter/Nationalism: Decolonizing Native America and Palestine , put it this way: “The current buildup of tremendous force at Standing Rock should be understood as a military invasion of a sovereign nation on behalf of a foreign oil company.” \\nThe heavy-handed response does not stem from local coordination alone. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department said in a press statement released Sunday that, “Due to escalated unlawful tactics by individuals protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, Morton County has requested additional law enforcement assistance from other states. The state of North Dakota made an Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) request to states for assistance on October 7th.” \\nRemarkably, the EMAC program is supposed to be used to allow “states to send personnel, equipment, and commodities to help disaster relief efforts in other states.” \\nAccording to the Morton County Sheriff’s Department, “Several states have responded and have arrived or will be arriving to support Morton County. States that are currently assisting Morton County are: Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming, Indiana and Nebraska.” AlterNet could not immediately reach Morton County for comment. \\nIn Minneapolis, news that local law enforcement officers were being sent to Standing Rock sparked protests on Wednesday. The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that, “At the request of the State of North Dakota, and as approved by the State of Minnesota, on Sunday, Minnesota Sheriff’s Deputies from the Hennepin, Anoka, and Washington Counties’ Sheriff’s Offices were deployed to assist in Morton County, North Dakota.” \\nThose counties cover the bulk of the Twin Cities area, where local police been accused of placing protesters in danger, through a far-reaching culture of incitement against the Black Lives Matter movement. In one incident, St. Paul police officer Jeff Rothecker was forced to resign in February after he was caught encouraging drivers to run over Black Lives Matter protesters slated to gather for a Martin Luther King Day mobilization. Lt. Bob Kroll, the head of the Minneapolis Police Officer’s Federation who has ties to a white-power-linked biker gang, has repeatedly referred to protesters as “terrorists.” \\nAs police departments around the country send reinforcements to North Dakota, the appeals of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe for federal protection from law enforcement violence appear to have had no effect. In a letter sent to Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this week, the water protectors asked the Department of Justice to intervene. \\n“To many people, the military tactics being used in North Dakota are reminiscent of the tactics used against protesters during the civil rights movement some 50 years ago,” the letter states. “But to us, there is an additional collective memory that comes to mind. This country has a long and sad history of using military force against indigenous people—including the Sioux Nation.” \\nSarah Lazare is a staff writer for AlterNet.

       "  'U.S.Army 4.7mm anti-aircraft gunsare lined up in the final assembly area of the Grand Rapids stamping division of Fisher Body in Detroit on June 1, 1944, prior to shipping.\\nMUNICH — World War II marked a crucial turning point for U.S. empire building and the growth of global capitalism, according to the historical analysis of noted political philosopher and scholar Noam Chomsky.\\nChomsky examined U.S. domination of world affairs in “ Who Owns The World? ,” a speech he delivered at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2012. In May, he published a book, “Who Rules The World?,” which examines similar themes.\\nWatch ‘ Noam Chomsky: Who Owns the World? Resistance and Ways Forward ‘ :\\nHe revisited the topic in a recent conversation with Zain Raza, a senior editor at the independent media outlet acTVism Munich. An excerpt from that conversation was published on Tuesday as part of acTVism Munich’s “Reexamining History” series .\\nMuch of the U.S. government’s global strategy both during and after World War II was based on a plan proposed by the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations , which Chomsky describes as the “major, non-governmental institution concerned with foreign affairs” whose membership “draws from a wide range of elite elements, business, politics, academics, and so on.”\\nBetween 1939 and 1945, the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations held regular strategy meetings to develop a post-war economic plan. These meetings led to proposal under which the United States would dominate a vast swath of the globe that came to be known as the “Grand Area,” Chomsky said. Explaining that the “Grand Area” would include “the Western Hemisphere,” Chomsky said:\\n“It included the former British Empire, which the U.S. was intending to largely take over, maybe Britain would be a junior partner. And as much of Europe, the commercial and industrial center of Europe, as much of that as possible. Certainly Western Europe, its industrial, technological, commercial center.”\\nWithin the “Grand Area,” Chomsky continued, “the United States would have pretty much complete economic and political control.”\\nWith the collapse of the German economy after the war, and amid the beginnings of the Cold War with Russia and China, the United States was in a unique position to implement this plan. Chomsky said:\\n“The war was very beneficial to the U.S. economy. Its industrial production virtually quadrupled, wartime spending ended the Depression, which had not been ended before — enormous stimulus to the economy. The technology that was developed just laid the basis for post-war growth. In that context ‘Grand Area’ planning of the kind I described was by no means unrealistic.”\\nFar from a Pentagon pipedream, the “Grand Area” became concrete U.S. foreign policy, and its effects linger to this day.\\n“If you look at the policies implemented and developed in the early post-war period, they follow these prescriptions pretty closely,” Chomsky said.\\nAs Chomsky and other historians have observed, Washington’s plans to dominate the “Grand Area” led directly to the Vietnam War. They were also crucial in the development of the International Monetary Fund , which continues to disrupt global economies for the benefit of multinational corporations and the military-industrial complex.\\nWatch ‘ Reexamining History with Noam Chomsky: New World Order & the Grand Area ‘:'],\n",

       "  ' Doomsday Election\\nBy Mike Whitney November 09, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" Counterpunch \" - This is what it must feel like to be on Death Row, to be waiting for the moment when the iron door clangs open for the last time and four burly guards escort you arm-in-arm to the room where your life will be extinguished. That same sense of dread hangs over the presidential election of 2016.\\nNo one is happy about the election and no one anticipates better days ahead. America\\x92s \\x91glory days\\x94 appear to be in the rearview mirror while the steady downward slide seems to be gaining pace. This year\\x92s presidential campaign has brought all the anger, anxiety and frustration bubbling to the surface. Nerves are raw, people are on edge, and the trepidation is so thick you could cut it with a knife. All the recent surveys tell the same story: Americans are sick of the mudslinging, sick of the scandals, sick of the recriminations, sick of the two party duopoly, and sick of the two candidates, the two most distrusted and reviled candidates in the country\\x92s 230 year history. This is from the New York Times:\\n\\x93An overwhelming majority of voters are disgusted by the state of American politics, and many harbor doubts that either major-party nominee can unite the country after a historically ugly presidential campaign, according to the final pre-election New York Times/CBS News Poll\\nWith more than eight in 10 voters saying the campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited, the rising toxicity threatens the ultimate victor. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, and Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, are seen as dishonest and viewed unfavorably by a majority of voters\\nAfter weeks of Mr. Trump\\x92s accusations that the election is \\x93rigged,\\x94 a little more than six in 10 of his supporters say they will accept the results as legitimate if he loses. More than a quarter of Mr. Trump\\x92s supporters say they will probably not accept the outcome if Mrs. Clinton is declared the winner, and nearly 40 percent of them say they have little or no confidence that Americans\\x92 votes will be counted properly.\\x94\\n( Voters Express Disgust Over U.S. Politics in New Times /CBS Poll, New York Times)\\nThe growing sense of desperation in America today is palpable and it goes far beyond this one, isolated election cycle. The steady erosion of confidence in the nation\\x92s main institutions is evident in Congress\\x92s public approval ratings which seem to be stuck in single-digit territory. The public probably feels equal contempt for the Loretta Lynch Justice Department which is loaded with Clinton toadies that have done their best to quash any investigation into the illicit pay-to-play machinations at the Clinton Foundation. And, let\\x92s not forget the media which has lost whatever shred of credibility it managed to salvage after its myriad of war-promoting lies about WMD, mobile weapons labs, aluminum tubes and Assad\\x92s imaginary chemical weapons attacks, attacks that were invented from whole cloth at one of Washington\\x92s many neocon think tanks where these fake ideas are typically hatched. The Forth Estate\\x92s latest gambit is an idiotic attempt to prove that Vladimir Putin is trying to hack our thoroughly-corrupted Third World voting system to achieve some nebulous political gain. What a joke.\\nNo, Hillary, Putin is not gaming the system like you did in the primaries with Bernie Sanders, nor did he put a gun to your head and force you to delete the 33,000 missing emails from your private server. That was your handiwork Ms. Clinton, although you have a done a masterful job in deflecting attention from yourself and passing the buck for your own sleazy, criminal activities onto Moscow.\\nBut, back to the media. This from Gallup:\\n\\x93Americans\\x92 trust and confidence in the mass media \\x93to report the news fully, accurately and fairly\\x94 has dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history, with 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This is down eight percentage points from last year.\\nGallup began asking this question in 1972, and on a yearly basis since 1997. Over the history of the entire trend, Americans\\x92 trust and confidence hit its highest point in 1976, at 72%, in the wake of widely lauded examples of investigative journalism regarding Vietnam and the Watergate scandal. After staying in the low to mid-50s through the late 1990s and into the early years of the new century, Americans\\x92 trust in the media has fallen slowly and steadily. It has consistently been below a majority level since 2007\\nBottom Line: the slide in media trust has been happening for the past decade. Before 2004, it was common for a majority of Americans to profess at least some trust in the mass media, but since then, less than half of Americans feel that way. Now, only about a third of the U.S. has any trust in the Fourth Estate, a stunning development for an institution designed to inform the public.\\x94 ( Americans\\x92 Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low , Gallup)\\n\\x93Designed to inform the public\\x94???\\nYou gotta be kidding? Droopy confidence in the media is a triumph for ordinary working people who have begun to see through the charade of \\x93unbiased coverage\\x94 and realize that the corporate owners of the press manipulate the news to shape perceptions and maintain their stranglehold on power. That\\x92s what\\x92s really going on, and that\\x92s why a growing number of people have swarmed to Donald Trump\\x92s campaign. They see Trump\\x92s lack of political correctness as a sign that he is not owned by the Washington oligarchy of racketeers who invent teleprompter candidates like Obama and Clinton who are never certain what they actually believe until they see it printed in bold letters on the screen in front of them.\\nTo large extent, Trump owes his shocking rise to the top of the GOP ticket to the fact that he shoots from the hip and that the media hates him. What was once a liability, has become an asset as trust for the despised media has plunged to depths never seen before.\\nBut that doesn\\x92t explain what\\x92s really driving this election and why are the American people so overcome by desperation?\\nIt\\x92s all about economic insecurity. It\\x92s all about the fact that standards of living are slipping, that an entire generation is bogged down with student debt, that all the good-paying jobs have been shipped to other countries, that family incomes are shriveling, that a good portion of the population feel threatened by immigration, that health care costs have skyrocketed, that retirement plans have been postponed, and that the great bulk of the nation\\x92s wealth has been transferred to the 1 percent plutocrats and Wall Street landsharks who dictate policy through their Congressional lackeys and their allies at the Federal Reserve. That\\x92s what the election is really all about.\\nPeople are waking up to the fact that the American dream is dead, that the US is no longer the land of opportunity, and that the lives of their children are going to be worse than their own, far worse. This is why everyone is so upset, so frustrated, so hopeless. They are looking for a political ally who will address their needs, and instead they get bromides on transgender bathrooms or \\x93glass ceilings\\x94 or any of the other soothing slogans the Democrats use to pacify the masses and to keep them in the flock. Only now it\\x92s not working as well. Now a sizable portion of the blue collar vote has shifted into Trump\\x92s camp mainly because they see through the phony Democrat rhetoric and all the job-eviscerating free trade deals they\\x92ve pushed for years. Trump has skillfully tapped into the collective psyche of millions of working people who feel the Democratic Party tossed them under the track-hoe 30 years ago and never looked back. And, he\\x92s right, too. The Dems have sold out their supporters, and it\\x92s only going to get worse under Clinton, or should we say, Madame TPP. Here\\x92s how Nile Bowie summed it up in a recent article at CounterPunch:\\n\\x93Economic disempowerment and political disenfranchisement have accelerated under President Obama, to the detriment of the American middle class. White, blue-collar Americans have witnessed the offshoring of their jobs and the erosion of their status in society, and Trump has masterfully stroked their resentment and discontent by playing on their fears of Muslims, immigrants and minorities\\nTrump\\x92s real problem with the Washington establishment is that he isn\\x92t part of it. His campaign represents an insurgent faction of the oligarchical class that aims to displace and replace the standing political elites. Bipartisan opposition to Trump is grounded in the belief that he would be an unreliable proxy and a liability, someone too narrow and unpredictable to manage the common affairs of the ruling class and the US deep state.\\nMoreover, the US establishment is not interested in being led by such a contentious figure, who would draw protest and public opposition in a way that more conventional establishment candidates largely do not. For example, Trump\\x92s rhetoric on immigration seems to engender more public outrage than the immigration policy under Obama, who has deported more people than any other president in history.\\x94 ( Election 2016: A Political System In Crisis , Nile Bowie, CounterPunch)\\nThe big money guys don\\x92t like Trump, and they make no bones about it. But Trump isn\\x92t going away and neither are his followers, a vast number of whom will not respect the results of the election if Hillary wins. That\\x92s a big problem for elites who like to manage the population through the popular election sham. Now all that\\x92s at risk.\\nAnd it\\x92s not like Trump hasn\\x92t bent over backwards to ingratiate himself with the deep-state powerbrokers either. He has. His first olive branch to the elites was the selection of Mike Pence as his running mate. Pence is a died-in-the-wool establishment Republican neocon who can be trusted to pursue the same extremist agenda the GOP has followed since the Gingrich revolution. But there was another big move that Trump made that escaped the notice of the media and which really underscores his willingness to \\x93play by to the rules.\\x94 Here\\x92s the story from Zero Hedge:\\n\\x93Six months ago, Steven Mnuchin became finance chair for the Trump campaign. Having successfully helped to raise 10s of millions of dollars for the campaign, the former Goldman Sachs partner and Soros Fund management employee is now positioned for something much larger as Donald Trump reportedly told his aides today that he wants Mnuchin to serve as his Treasury Secretary.\\nIronically, Trump has often criticized Clinton (and his former competitor Ted Cruz) for their links to the big banks:\\n\\x93I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,\\x94 Trump said in one debate.\\nBut as we noted previously, he had no qualms, however, in hiring one of the most prominent Goldman alums to raise money for him.\\nfor Trump, a self-professed \\x93anti-establishment\\x94 candidate, who has repeatedly stated he is not \\x93for sale to special interest groups\\x94, his sudden call for the seemingly most \\x93Wall Street\\x94 of Wall-Streeters to become Treasury Secretary may come as a big surprise to some and will leave many of his supporters demanding an explanation.\\x94 ( Trump Wants Former Goldman Partner And Soros Employee To Serve As Treasury Secretary , Zero Hedge)\\nAnother head of Treasury from G-Sax?\\nThat figures.\\nTrump is great with the rabble-rousing \\x93take back your country\\x94 tirades and all the gibberish about the \\x93rigged\\x94 system. But he also knows how to cave in when it suits his interests. He knows he\\x92s not going to be president without Wall Street\\x92s nod, so he\\x92s enlisted a trusted insider to take care of business at Treasury. It\\x92s a signal to the bigwigs that they don\\x92t have to worry about the Donald going off the reservation. (wink, wink) So much for Trump\\x92s independence, eh?\\nAnd what can we say about Hillary Clinton that hasn\\x92t been said a million times before?\\nClinton, who still holds a slim lead in most of the polls, is clearly the establishment candidate in a year when hatred for the corrupt Washington oligarchy, has reached levels not seen in the last hundred years. The fact that Hillary can run for the nation\\x92s highest office while being investigated by the FBI, while being savaged by the daily releases of new, incriminating emails (from WikiLeaks), and while promoting a hawkish, neocon-driven foreign policy that portends a direct military confrontation with Russia, speaks to the fact that traditional liberal Democrats are either still hoodwinked by the Democratic Party\\x92s manipulation of identity politics or simply terrified of the alternative, Donald Trump.\\nAnd that\\x92s why everyone is so utterly dejected and depressed about the election, because instead of voting for a candidate they really want or admire, most people are simply voting for the candidate that either disgusts or scares the hell out of them the least. What kind of choice is that?\\nIn less than 24 hours, the most agonizingly-wretched campaign of all times will be over, the ballots will be counted, and the new president will be named. The only thing that is certain is that, whoever wins, we lose. Mike Whitney lives in Washington state. He is a contributor to Hopeless: Barack Obama and the Politics of Illusion (AK Press).

       " ['Is the FBI Constitutional?',\n",
       "  'Email \\nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) James Comey is again under fire, this time by supporters of Hillary Clinton for permitting the re-opening of the investigation into her use of personal servers to store and send classified material, the second round of a scandal that could prove fatal to the Democratic nominee\\'s chance to occupy the Oval Office in January. \\nRepublicans had their own go at Comey when he declared after the original investigation of Clinton\\'s mishandling of classified documents and information that there was insufficient evidence to charge her with any criminal violation. \\nComey, it seems, has become a punching bag being worked over by partisans on both sides of the political aisle. \\nRegarding the sound and fury coming out of the Clinton camp, they don\\'t see that their candidate has fallen into a pit she dug for herself. She knew, or should have known, that there are rules governing the treatment and transmission of data that could place U.S. national security in danger. \\nShe broke those rules, and despite what Comey claimed, whether she did so knowingly or not is irrelevant, as the requisite mental state codified into the regulation is \"negligence.\" That is to say, in order to be in violation of the relevant statute, one need only fail to take reasonable care in the behavior in question. \\nIt is beyond dispute that there was a duty of care, and Hillary Clinton\\'s behavior fell well below that bar. \\nWhat is also beyond dispute is that neither the Republicans — when Clinton was exonerated — or the Democrats — when the whole affair was brought back into the light of investigation — ever questioned the authority of the FBI to carry on as a federal police force. \\nThe larger question, the constitutional question, is why does the federal government have an armed police force with nearly unlimited authority (at home and abroad) and with the power to conduct most of its work in secret, beyond the oversight of the American people, whose interest they ostensibly serve? \\nPerhaps Ryan McMaken has hit upon the answer to that question in an article published on the Mises Wire blog. McMaken writes of the federal government\\'s law enforcement agency: Of all federal police forces, the FBI is the most romanticized, and every FBI agent is assumed to be the modern embodiment of a fictionalized version of Eliot Ness: incorruptible, professional, and efficient. Decades of pop culture has driven this home with TV series and movies such as The Untouchables , The FBI Story , and This Is Your FBI have long perpetuated the idea that when local police fail, the FBI will step in to be more effective and simply better than every other law enforcement agency. Corruption cannot touch the FBI, we are told, and they apply the law equally to everyone. \\nAccording to a piece penned in 2012, \"A Stasi for America,\" reporter James Bovard painted a darker, less egalitarian picture of the FBI\\'s application of the law: A ripple of protest swept across the Internet in late March after the disclosure that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was teaching its agents that “the FBI has the ability to bend or suspend the law to impinge on the freedom of others.” This maxim was inculcated as part of FBI counterterrorism training. The exposure of the training material — sparked by a series of articles by Wired.com’s Spencer Ackerman — spurred the ritual declaration by an FBI spokesman that “mistakes were made, and we are correcting those mistakes.” No FBI officials were sanctioned or fired for teaching lawmen that they were above the law.... At least the FBI has been consistent. Since its founding in 1908, the bureau has rarely let either the statute book or the Constitution impede its public service. Tim Weiner, the author of a superb exposé of the CIA ( Legacy of Ashes ) has delivered a riveting chronology of some of the FBI’s biggest crimes with his new book, Enemies . \\nThere\\'s no question that in its roughly 100 years of existence, the FBI has seen its reputation rise and fall. \\nMcMaken recites a bit of recent history in support of his assertion that the creation and the continuation of the FBI as a federal secret police force is an assault on the liberty of the United States: The reality and the romance, of course, have always been two totally different things, and it\\'s helpful to remind ourselves that it was the FBI that was in charge of the Waco massacre where 26 children were killed. It was the FBI that led the raid on Randy Weaver\\'s house where an FBI sniper shot a woman dead while she was holding a 10-month old baby. It was the FBI that spied on Martin Luther King, Jr., and targeted peaceful anti-war organizations for political reasons during the 1960s and 70s. It was the FBI that came of age arresting opponents of the First World War. Naturally, in all of these cases, the FBI has actively covered up the facts and denied wrongdoing. \\nNext, the history lesson looks further back to the beginnings of the FBI to illuminate the transformation of the FBI from crime-fighting force (albeit no less unconstitutional) to powerful partner in the surveillance state: Thanks to war hysteria during World War I, the FBI rose to prominence as Woodrow Wilson\\'s shock troops against \"dissidents\" (i.e., peaceful opponents of the war). Indeed, persecuting and prosecuting political enemies of the American state would become something of the forte of the FBI, with the role of the agency being expanded ever more during times of perceived national crisis. The idea of the FBI as a crime-fighting organization — the primary message of fawning treatments of the FBI such as The Untouchables and The FBI Story — for decades served as cover for the FBI\\'s political activities. As Foreign Policy pointed out in 2014, though, the FBI quietly dropped its claims of being a crime fighting organization and began declaring itself a \"national security\" organization. Down the memory hole goes the FBI\\'s original claimed raison d\\'etre. \\nThis point is borne out in the FBI\\'s own description of its purpose. On the \"Questions and Answers\" section of its official web page, the agency describes itself as \"an intelligence-driven and threat-focused national security organization with both intelligence and law enforcement responsibilities.\" \\nWhere, one wonders, does the Constitution grant the federal government or any of its associated agencies any intelligence gathering and federal law-enforcement power? \\nFinally, not only is the FBI\\'s assumption of its current role as federal police force and armed branch of the federal surveillance apparatus unconstitutional and a persistent threat to freedom, but it represents yet another example of the inability of the government to perform any task on par with a privately owned entity with the same or similar objective. Again, from the Mises Wire: \"The unreliability of metropolitan police, with their strong local and partisan ties, prompted major businesses and industrialists to establish the Pinkertons and other private police forces. The Pinkertons ultimately functioned as a de facto national detective and policing service until the 1920s, when the FBI finally came into its own.\" \\nAs one scandal blends into the next, and as each generation sees the occurrence of some serious act of FBI abuse of power, perhaps it is time to consider the abolition of the agency and the return of its assumed duties to the private sector.

       " ['Breaking: Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin Could Be A Spy | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'Email Print It has been revealed that there are about 650,000 emails on Huma Abedin’s husband’s laptop. Of the 650,000 emails, thousands are labeled “classified” National Security material forwarded from another email server. According to sources, the emails were discovered in a folder labeled, “Life Insurance”. Is it possible the folder was mislabeled by Abedin to deliberately conceal its contents? This also begs the question: How did Huma Abedin get National Security clearance? \\nThe NY Post explains where FBI originally dropped the ball when they first investigated Abedin: Skeptical agents showed Abedin three separate email exchanges she had with an IT staffer regarding the operation of the private Clinton server during Clinton’s tenure at State. Abedin claimed she “did not recall” the email exchanges. So if you believe Abedin, she didn’t know the private clintonemail.com server that hosted her [email protected] account even existed until she heard about it in the news. Comey was a believer; he didn’t even bother to call her back for further questioning. Case closed. But Abedin’s role in this caper begs for fresh scrutiny. Making false statements to a federal agent is a felony. So is mishandling classified information. By forwarding classified emails to her personal email account and printing them out at home, Abedin appears to have violated a Classified Information NonDisclosure Agreement she signed at the State Department on Jan. 30, 2009, in which she agreed to keep all classified material under the control of the US government. An infographic puts it in a simpler form, stating how government emails were forwarded to her Yahoo account — for what? No one knows. There was allegedly a counter-espionage case going on around the time. With 500,000,000 email accounts hacked earlier last year, Abedin has put our National Security in danger.

       "  \"NBC's Baghdad Bob: There Is No FBI Investigation of Hillary November 4, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \\nRemember when Hillary Clinton was insisting that there was no FBI investigation of her, just a security review, even when the FBI rejected that claim? \\nWell Andrea Mitchell, NBC's own Baghdad Bob, isn't giving up that claim so easily. Even while the rest of the Clinton clique is screeching against the FBI for investigating Hillary like bats from the nether regions of left-wing hell, Mitchell is sticking to the old spin. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary . Close your eyes and say it three times. The FBI is not investigating Hillary. It's not. It's not. \\nIn a complete state of denial on Thursday, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell interrupted live coverage of Donald Trump speaking at a Florida campaign rally to supposedly “fact-check” the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the FBI was conducting an extensive investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mail and charitable foundation scandals. \\nMitchell refused to accept reality: “Just a lot of fact-checking to do. She's not under criminal investigation. In fact, it's not an investigation. It's just a review of the e-mails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, there’s no criminality.” She fretted: “I don't know even where to start....but I mean, we have to put it in some context.” \\nThe context is that defending Hillary Clinton has become a mental illness. \\nBut as I wrote earlier this week, fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary. Anyone who believes that is probably some sort of right-winger who listens to what the FBI actually says, rather than what NBC says that the FBI says. \"],\n",
       " ['Curious Alliances Taking Place Amid Mosul Operation | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Iraq As it always happens, a major military offensive in a country where multiple interests collide and converge, alliances take place. Some new are formed and some old suffer a set-back. Iraqi army’s operation in Mosul, the erstwhile capital of the Islamic State in Iraq, has produced the same kind of impact. As such, whereas it has widened the gulf between the US and Turkey (read: the US has quietly opposed Turkey’s military intervention in Iraq), it has equally bridged, to an extent, the gap between the US and Iran. On the other, the US opposition to a Turkish invasion of Iraq has brought Russia and Turkey a step closer to making an alliance in Syria and influence the situation together to their advantage. In short, what we have on the ground today is this: US, Iraq and Iran are quietly co-ordinating against IS in Mosul; while Turkey and Russia are watching it and responding to it accordingly. Two recent developments indicate this scenario: Turkey has scaled down its demand for a fully-fledged participation in the battle for Mosul, whereas Russia has redefined its strategic objectives in Syria that now include liberation of the whole country under the leadership of President Assad. This re-defined objectives has its roots in the sense that both Russia and Syria are getting from the Mosul operation: IS fighters from Iraq may find the newly liberated and the still-to-be-liberated areas in Syria as suitable sanctuaries to shift to and re-launch their ‘jihad.’ On the other hand, the fact that Tukey has been forced out of the battle for Mosul, a city it historically considers its own part, its chances of finding a place on the negotiating table have faded considerably, leaving it with no other option but to extend its engagement with Russia. Mosul, for Turkey, has a lot of strategic attraction. Ankara tends to organize and reinvigorate militia forces affiliated with it, which can be achieved through military presence in the Sunni-dominated city of Mosul and training those forces in Iraq. This plan aims to restrict Iran’s clout in Iraq and create some sort of power balance between Tehran and Ankara in the political arena of Iraq. However, with the US denying Turkey a ground military presence, this objective has suffered a clear set-back. As such, an important factor that has contributed to convergence of Russia and Turkey is the way Iran and the US are co-operating. Unsurprisingly, the US has preferred that the liberation of Mosul is best handled by Iraqi forces and affiliated militia without Turkish involvement, which is also the demand of Baghdad and the secret wish of Tehran. In this context, Iraqi Army’s alliance with the Shi’ite-based Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in the fight to retake Mosul makes perfects sense. Needless to say, PMF factions are led by none other than the charismatic commander of Iran’s famous Quds Force Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani. This Iran-US co-operation has been facilitated by the fact the US had secretly lifted some of financial sanctions in January that were to be originally lifted in 2023, allowing Iranian economy a reasonable breathing space in the global market. As part of the secret package deal signed in January 2015 in Geneva, Western companies can now do business with Iranian companies that may be linked to politicians and generals in Tehran (including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards commanders) who figured in the US’ sanctions list previously. Equally, the Obama administration has begun allowing Iran to use American dollars in its business dealings with foreign companies. This being the extent of co-operation between the US and Iran, an alliance between Russia and Turkey does make sense. Hence, Erdogan’s emphasis on working in co-ordination with Russia in Syria over the battle for Aleppo. As some reports have shown, Turkish President Recep Erdogan disclosed in the last week that in a phone conversation with Putin, they discussed the Russian wish that Ankara should persuade the al-Nusra fighters to leave Aleppo without further fighting. “We (Turkey and Russia) have given necessary instructions to our colleagues and have started to work in this direction. And we also discussed an agreement on how to drive out the al-Nusra from Aleppo and provide peace for the city’s inhabitants, and for this we need to work together,” Erdogan said. He added that if there is an exodus from Aleppo due to the fighting, Turkey will be willing to accept at least one million refugees. For Turkey, co-operation with Russia has become a lot more important in the context of extended US-Iran co-operation. Were Turkey not to co-operate with Russia over the battle for Aleppo, Turkey’s ‘Euphrates Shield’ might suffer similar set-backs its objectives in Iraq/Mosul have. Therefore, in addition to Turkey’s continued need of Russian acquiescence over its ‘Euphrates Shield’ operations in northern Syria, Ankara does also want to count on whatever Moscow could do to help resolve the contradictions involving Iran and Iraq today in Iraq. Contradictions The bigger picture emerging out of this whole scenario involves certain contradictions. Consider this: while the US is restricting Turkish involvement in Iraq, the former continues to rely on the latter for its military presence in Syria. Needless to say, despite their disagreement over Iraq, Turkey still remains a NATO member. This is because of the fact that whereas the US has a 7500 strong military presence in Iraq, it lacks such presence in Syria where Turkey influences, if not dictates, terms of engagement. Similarly, while Russia is watching over increasing convergence between the US and Iran in Iraq, both Russia and Iran continue to co-operate in Syria. As a matter of fact, nothing could be of more help to Iran than Russia striving for Syria’s complete liberation. In the same line, the US and Iran continue to have diametrically opposite views and objectives vis-à-vis Syria. With the question of Assad’s future still colouring their bi-lateral terms, it is far from clear which direction their mutual relations would go in the future. While important sanctions have been lifted, many still remain in place. Therefore, the alliances taking place in the shadow of Mosul operation are contradictory and may fall with the fall of IS in Iraq if those contradictions are not sorted out and resolved. What can resolve this contradiction is not how and the extent to which the countries involved co-operate in Iraq and Syria, but how these countries define their interests and the tactics they use to achieve them. \\nSalman Rafi Sheikh, research-analyst of International Relations and Pakistan’s foreign and domestic affairs, exclusively for the online magazine “ New Eastern Outlook ”.

       " ['Riots in Portland on Third Night of Protests       : Information',\n",
       "  ' Riots in Portland on Third Night of Protests Trump returns to Twitter to complain about \"unfair\" protests \"incited\" by media. By Ed Krayewski\\n \" Reason \" - There were more protests around the country against the election of Donald Trump last night, with police in Portland declaring the protest there a riot due to deteriorating conditions. Rioters there threw objects at cops, attacked newspaper stands, and smashed windows. Earlier, police said protesters were trying to stop \"anarchist groups\" from destroying property, and tweeted that it encouraged others to leave the area, before declaring the situation a riot and issuing orders to disperse the \"unlawful assembly.\" Police say they made 26 arrests and dispersed the crowd using pepper spray, \"rubber ball distraction devices\" and rubber baton rounds.\\nTrump returned to Twitter for the first time since being elected on Tuesday night after spending the day in Washington, tweeting that \"professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting,\" calling it \"very unfair!\" NBC News described the tweet as \"putting an end to a brief stretch of conciliatory behavior since Tuesday,\" although one salty tweet in a 72 hour period doesn\\'t seem like enough data to come to that conclusion. Trump had \"returned to pre-election form,\" as NBC News put it, also pointing out Trump himself had tweeted in favor of a march on Washington after Mitt Romney\\'s 2012 loss, and suggested if he lost riots could ensue.\\nAt least two other prominent Trump supporters, Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke and former Rep. Joe Walsh, had also tweeted supportively of protests and civil disobedience before the election but called for a tough response after. They did not expect Trump to win, so the calculus changed. Things are different now that he\\'s president-elect\\x97though not for Trump\\'s tendency to make loose statements and the media\\'s tendency to botch interpretations of those statements.\\nTrump\\'s tweet was characterized as \"unpresidential.\" I\\'m not sure what was expected at this point, particularly since such protests have, until now, worked in Trump\\'s favor. The Trump campaign cancelled a rally in Chicago after massive protests there. Trump said the protests would \"energize\" his voters\\x97he clinched the nomination in May. By June, I noted how attacks on Trump supporters by anti-Trump protesters were an apparent effort to help get Trump elected. In late September, when protests and riots erupted in Charlotte after a fatal police shooting there, I suggested the city was working hard to get North Carolina in the Trump column.\\nOn Wednesday night, when there were protests and \"vigils\" around the country, I suggested this trend to could end up helping Trump by earning him political capital and helping drive never-Trump conservatives back into the fold. Protesters say they are demonstrating because Donald Trump has created a climate of fear for minorities. Riots also have that tendency. If the mostly white rioters in Portland last night provide police in the city to ramp up enforcement, that endangers marginalized people the most. Protests last month over a police contract the outgoing mayor pushed through before leaving office failed to stop the contract, and it\\'s not unreasonable to fear tonight\\'s riots will increase tensions in altogether different neighborhoods.\\nAnd for all the talk pre-election of \"voter intimidation,\" what else could violent protests over the result of an election be other than voter intimidation? Hillary Clinton won Portland overwhelmingly, but that still leaves a minority of Trump voters watching their fellow citizens destroy property over the way they voted. And it leaves a slew of residents who didn\\'t vote, but will probably eventually be blamed for Trump\\'s win as well. Blame anyone but Clinton and the Democratic Party.\\nSome Anti-Trump protesters like to compare Trump to Hitler, yet it doesn\\'t seem they understand their own comparison. Hitler used civil unrest\\x97specifically the Reichstag fire\\x97to greatly expand his powers after he had already been elected. At the Republican convention, Trump called America a \"divided crime scene\" and said \"only\" he could solve the country\\'s problems. Anti-Trump protesters are setting the stage for him. It\\'s hard to imagine what continued violent protests (the Portland group has organized as a Resistance) can accomplish other than creating a climate of fear Trump could exploit to make it easier to get what he wants, whatever that turns out to be.\\nA write-up of a mostly white riot in Portland would perhaps be incomplete with a note about the occupation of a remote outpost in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in protest of federal prosecutors reneging on a plea deal with two ranchers who had set a fire on their property that spread onto federal land, appealing the sentences handed down in favor for longer ones. Those protesters were called \"terrorists\" by many left-wing commentators because they were armed. The hashtag #OregonUnderAttack went viral. No one has suggested Oregon, or Portland, have been under attack tonight, nor has anyone called the protesters or rioters terrorists. But as usual, one side has created a precedent when it was convenient rhetorically in the short term that can be used by the other side with as much, if not more, effect.\\nIf anti-Trump protesters are concerned about the powers Trump will inherit, President Obama and the Congress have two and a half months to try to get something accomplished in terms of limiting executive power. The prospect is unlikely already. Directionless protests make the prospect less likely, and also place efforts at reducing government power after Trump is in office at a disadvantage. Although protesters may be more interesting in expressing their feelings, including by rioting, than reducing government power and constraining the office of the president.\\nVandalized cars, smashed windows: Anti-Trump protest in Portland proclaimed \\x91riot\\x92 (PHOTOS, VIDEO): Some 4,000 people started their protest at Pioneer Courthouse Square and moved to northeast Portland, according to The Oregonian daily.

       " ['Yemen and YET another “False Flag” to Protect Saudi and US Interests in the Middle East | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Saudi Arabia In Seth Ferris’ NEO article on Yemen back in April it was suggested that the only reason the US suddenly withdrew from Yemen, after staying there through thick and thin, was because the US had only taken over the country to supply arms to terrorists. Now it is back – its warships are patrolling the coast so that it can maintain a military presence in another form, having yet to be embarrassed by the stolen military files which Ferris claims will prove his case. It is these warships which are being attacked by the Houthis. These are the people the US claims looted those millions of dollars of weapons which mysteriously vanished. So anything can be blamed on them, because they are covered by a previous official story. However, no one has yet provided a clear link between these attacks and the rebels. Remains of American munitions have been found, but these were not necessarily looted ones. Nor were they found near the warships: most conveniently, they were found like discarded foreign passports in the rubble of factories, hospitals, bridges and power stations attacked by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, not the rebels. This stunt is so blatant that even the New York Times is prepared to report it . We remember that earlier this year the U.S. military launched cruise missiles at radar sites along Yemen’s Red Sea coast, after its ships were supposedly targeted by missiles fired from rebel-controlled areas. Therefore the justification for making more cruise missile attacks is simply sending warships to the coast during a time of conflict. Apparently the last cruise missile attacks didn’t work, because the rebels are still shooting, despite the deadly effect of cruise missiles highlighted so effectively by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during its various waves of mass support . This suggests that neither the attacks on the warships or the US response were real, yet more false flags in support of failed US regional policy and the election campaign for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This whole story looks too bad to be true. Looted weapons which no one saw being looted, convenient enemies, an ongoing conflict the next president has no choice but to support the military in – Yemen is currently able to provide it all, without the long discussions which would take place if the same was happening in more debated hotspots like Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan. These attacks suit too many of the wrong people to be taken seriously – unless you happen to be Yemeni, but as ever the people the US claims to be doing these things for are the least important part of the equation. Blame it on Iran The USS Mason, a destroyer of the US 6th fleet, allegedly came under attack by the Houthis not once, not twice, but three times within days. The US has struck back by targeting and destroying radar sites in Houthi territory, if reports are to be believed . The missiles used against US warships are claimed to be Iranian Zafzlal III models. Of course they are – the US public and politicians are used to denouncing Iran, as they have been brought up to take that as a default position. If the word “Iran” is associated with something controversial, like the gas heater that supposedly killed the former Georgian PM during the George W. Bush presidency, that is supposed to explain it all. Particularly when we understand that Alarabiya is a pro-Saudi site with a long history of trying to implicate Iran in everything. Older heads can recall the Gulf of Tonkin Incident in 1964, in which two attacks were allegedly made on a US destroyer by a North Vietnamese patrol boat. The second never happened, and the first was misreported as an attack by the Vietnamese boats, in whose territorial waters the destroyer was trespassing, whereas in fact the US fired first. These false attacks led to President Johnson being given the legal justification to launch open warfare against North Vietnam. This famously led to crowds following him everywhere chanting “LBJ, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today ?” Gulf of Tonkin showed how is easy it is for a US president who presses the right verbal buttons to manufacture consent for his actions. The Houthis are a little-known and little understood force, and can thus be presented in any way the US State Department wants. All the vast majority of Americans are aware of is that they are Muslim separatists who are on the other side to the US, but that makes them a fair target as they are trying to destroy the American way of life, democracy and human rights. Perhaps Yemenis don’t aspire to the American way of life, even if they want the commercial benefits. But the US has to believe that everyone does to explain it own success, which would be a far more difficult process than assuming it is the product of some moral superiority. Shacking-up of convenience Saudi Arabia needs US support in Yemen because its adventures there have put the Saudi state itself at risk. The Yemen war has deeply damaged the Saudis, exposing the incompetence of both the military and the House of Saud—to the point that there is a risk it will cause a civil insurrection which will split the country in two. The eastern half, where Mecca and Medina are, wants to break away, as its inhabitants are from a completely separate tribal grouping to those of the eastern half, where the gilded rulers live. The US took advantage of that situation to enter Yemen and make it the regional dirty tricks capital. It is not going to leave until it has found another, as we saw when it stayed in Georgia, with a president it was happy to get rid of, until it could start moving its operations to Ukraine using the same individuals. The US still has a free hand in Yemen because the Saudis don’t have any other friends, apart from Bahrain, Qatar and Dubai, which are also run by despotic dynasties. Troops from those nations have fought alongside the Saudis in Yemen but have been no more effective than the Saudi troops, being nothing more than fodder for the Houthi’s cannons. So the US has no reason to leave, which is what made its sudden withdrawal after those documents were stolen all the more suspicious. But the US still has to manufacture consent not only to stay there, but justify its previous actions to its own public. If they were undertaken as part of a friendly intervention, this would be one thing. If US ships are attacked by Iranian weapons, this transforms the opponent into a known enemy and forces the US to intervene as a combatant in its own right. It also deflects any attention from how we got to this point – which can be excoriating, as Tony Blair has recently found to his cost . This desire also explains recent “independent” Saudi actions towards Iran. A senior Iranian military official has recently accused Israel and Saudi Arabia of collaborating on a plot to stir insurrection within the Islamic Republic. “We have thorough intelligence that Al Saud, in collusion with the Zionist regime, is hatching plots against our country,” Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari was quoted by Iran’s Press TV as saying . Calm before the storm Saudi Arabia’s major foreign policy decisions are often based on a general consensus among a number of senior princes. The operation in Yemen is no exception, and had the former King Abdullah still been alive, he would have most likely chosen exactly the same response to the current situation. Saudi Arabia’s goal is to reinstate the now-deposed President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. However Saudi troops have suffered major problems with various attempts to invade Yemen, and they know that any occupation is out of the question without the help of an outside power, such as the US military . Supply lines are stretched too thin, and are subject to attacks, as Houthi know how to fight a guerilla war under the harshest of conditions, and have successfully dealt with their neighbour for the last 80 years. Some claim that Saudi Arabia wants to sort things out with Yemen, come-hell-or-high water, in order to be able to have a greater impact at regional level. It hopes to weigh in on conflicts elsewhere in the MENA (Middle East and North African) countries. However to do this it needs political stability, and the reverses in Yemen have put that in question. Any long-term occupation of the country would come at too high a cost for the Saudis – financially, politically and in terms of human lives. Attention also needs to be diverted from the 28 pages of the 9/11 report that basically implicates the Saudi leadership in a terrorist attack on the American homeland, and the involvement of Saudi intelligence in Syria and Northern Iraq, where it has provided material support to known terrorists groups. The US knows it will stay in Yemen for as long as the Saudi monarchy is in danger of collapse, as the political systems of countries which lose wars often do. The worst of a bad job In Johnson’s time the US was expected to act unilaterally. Now it acts in partnership with other nations to cover its illegal acts – as if acting purely in response to their concerns, as a strategic partner, not from selfish motives of its own. Any temporary lull in such interventions provides an opportunity for all sides to lick their wounds and prepare for the next stage in the fighting, or allows the PR machine to catch up with the game plan on the ground, especially in an election year . But the Saudis have violated all ceasefires to date, and will likely try to continue doing the same now and into the future. As reported by the NYT, “millions have been forced from their homes, and since August, the government has been unable to pay the salaries of most of the 1.2 million civil servants.” Now that the Clinton influence peddling scheme has been exposed in the wake of the US presidential elections Saudi donations will dry up, as will their blank check to get away with murder. The Saudis will have fewer well-connected friends in the US State Department. But this is unlikely to prevent any further adventures in Yemen: on the contrary, the Saudis will need them all the more to prevent further embarrassments within the US, while the US military needs them to prevent its own embarrassment. Donald Trump has said several times that he doesn’t agree with the US spending all this money on all these foreign wars. Not only was a ramping-up of the Yemen conflict an attempt to support Clinton, it was an attempt to force Trump to support the military ad the general policy of fighting all these wars, should he be elected. Now that has happened, does anyone expect the military to just go home, with so many bases still in place and so many arms deals still being serviced? Trump can’t stop these things on his say-so, and is too much of a businessman to try and take on the whole capital structure of the US. The selling point of remaining in Yemen may well be that it reduces the Iranian direct involvement in protecting Assad and draws attention away from the movement of terrorist proxy fighters from Iraq back into Syria proper. It is much easier for Trump to continue demonising Iran, as a Muslim nation, than to stop this movement. But once this step is taken a precedent for this administration will have been set. Trump will either have to take on his military continually or find ways of justifying it – and Yemen, although not of Trump’s making, gives him every excuse to do the latter whilst still pretending to follow his campaign policy.

       " ['Readings in the Jewish Zionist Control of the United States: Interviews with Francis Boyle, James Petras, Kim Petersen',\n",
       "  'Part 1: Introduction 10 Shares\\n9 0 0 1\\nFor the last 30 years, I have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts. This reluctance to criticize any policies of the Israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the American-Israel Political Action Committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices.\\n— Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter [1]\\nHow the Interviews Came About\\nThe Marxian thesis that the dominant culture and ideology of a society (here referred to as Social Base or just Base) are those of the dominant class (here referred to as System) is a sharp tool to probe how political systems work and how they stay in power. Does this tool work in the U.S. model? Certainly, , the relation between the System and its Social Base has been regular since the inception of the thirteen colonies. Because of that sustained regularity, System and Base acted in convergent patterns of dependency. In historical perspective, it was not possible for the System to transform those colonies into states, and thereafter expand its conquests to form a continental empire without a solid social base that shared its purpose and visions for expansion. From that time onward, an ideological symbiosis ran between the System and the Base. Not only that, but each time the System modifies direction, philosophy, or ideology, the Base would adapt by modifying its attitudes and perception.\\nThe patterns of ideological association between the U.S. System and its Social Base extended into modern times, and the yardstick to measure them is the presidential elections. If you look at voters\\' turnout since 1960 , you will notice that a relative-to-large majority of Americans had voted in those elections. My interpretation of the vote in relation to Marx\\'s thesis is the following. Voting for a system that is known for its aggressive imperialist policies, crimes around the world, overthrowing foreign governments not in line with Washington, and countless military interventions and invasions that left millions of people dead means one thing: Voting for that system while knowing its attributes, policies, and actions amounts to active sharing in its ideology, culture, and violence.\\nMORE... Zionism is Racism Zionism goes from bad to worse, taking Judaism with it How modern is Israel? Green Party of Canada calls to revoke Jewish National Fund charitable status Caveat! That does not necessarily mean that all voters share the System\\'s imperialistic values of violence and destruction of foreign peoples. The pertinent meaning of voting interpreted in relation to the System\\'s foreign policy objectives versus the objectives of the Base resides in two concepts. Discarding immediately the notion that the Base has been cohabitated by the system, the first concept has it that the Base has given a mandate to the System to carry out its ideology of empire and imperialism based on the undeclared condition to spare the people from the horrors of foreign wars. A dichotomy sets in here. The System has its way of life, and the Base has its own. The second concept has to do with the basic tenets of colonialism. Meaning, if the System could be successful to obtain unspecified benefits through wars, then the base could share in these benefits despite aversion to violence and opposition to the institution of war as a means to resolve problems between nations.\\n A question: Would abstaining from voting resolve the issue of \"active sharing\" in the policies of the system? This subject is open for debate . . .\\nThe relation between the American System and its Base was uniform up to a certain point in history (late 1920s). Until that point, the American state was still busy completing its structural transformation into a big power status. That uniformity, however, managed to keep the patterns of the political power unchanged. To be exact, despite persistent immigration that should have altered the relations between the Base and government, as well as the composition of the latter, the dominance of the traditional ruling elites was 1) not open for challenge, and 2) shaped by an exclusive American Anglo-Saxon experience.\\nBut when Franklyn D. Roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the Zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a \"Jewish\" state in Palestine, he opened a large crack in the System. That was the first time in U.S. history where the powerful American imperialist state yielded to a foreign ideology that was not part of its basic project. With that, a movement with a limited religious social base began penetrating the files and ranks of the U.S. power. The rest is history. As a result, the unrelenting entrenchment inside the political structures of the United States coupled with accumulated changes in the configuration of the U.S. power, the dominant American System itself fell under the domination of one of its social factions—American Jewish Zionists.\\nWhen Franklyn D. Roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the Zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a \"Jewish\" state in Palestine, he opened a large crack in the System.\\nAs a group, American Jewish Zionists have all attributes of an independent establishment. They possess efficient organizational structures, have a monolithic political presence across the American system, and they know how to finance their activities with U.S. tax money. I must note that their alignment with the global agenda of U.S. imperialism is a two-point expedient. The first is focused on being recognized as earnest operators at the service of America\\'s interests. The second is tactical. To reap, on behalf of Israel, the benefits of alignment with slogans such as \"Israel is our only trusted ally in the Middle East\".\\nThe American Jewish Zionist experience is agenda driven. As such, their domestic and foreign agendas have precedence over any other Jewish-related consideration.\\nOn the domestic front, the focus could not be more evident: to consolidate Zionism and turn it into a means to 1) perpetuate Israel as an American national issue, and 2) make of them the principal factor in defining American politics. You can notice the endeavor clearly during U.S. elections when the Zionist media question whether this or that candidate is good for the Jews, and for Israel. Today, voicing dissent against the policies of American Jewish Zionism or criticizing Israel amounts to crime. Jimmy Carter experienced this firsthand. When he published his book: Palestine: Peace not Apartheid , American Jewish Zionists unleashed the fire of hell upon him.\\nAs for the Jewish Zionist foreign agenda, this is clear-cut and leaves no space for misunderstanding. It aims to induce, control, or lead the United States to 1) adopt hostile policies toward the Arab nations because due to their rejection of the Zionist state, and 2) undertake military actions against any country that appears as posing a potential or direct threat to Israel. Equally important, it demands that the United States keep denying the Palestinians rights for nationhood through American diplomacy. What is the rationale? Recognition of the Palestinian national rights means the invalidation of the Zionist state and its claim on Palestine.\\nBecause the Jewish Zionist control of the U.S. System is real and dominant, how does the American society figure vis-à-vis this dominance? Based on observations of the American society and its multiple cultural and ideological patterns, there can be but one answer: Zionism is not the dominant culture and ideology of the American people. It is, however, the dominant culture and ideology of the U.S. political system.\\nOBSERVATIONS\\nFirst, despite gargantuan Zionist propaganda apparatuses directed to the American people, Jewish Zionists have consistently failed to create interest or sympathy for Zionist issues and for Israel,\\nSecond, due to historically developed indifference to foreign issues, a majority of Americans have only vague ideas on what Zionism is,\\nThird, to establish roots for their political dominance, Jewish Zionist activists invariably focus not on the American people, but on ways to control the American system from inside by controlling first the institutions that matter: White House and Congress.\\nFourth, this control did not happen because of elections. It is preponderantly due to the practice of appointing Jewish Zionists to important positions inside the administrations,\\nFifth, among the stratagems employed by Zionists when they run for elective offices, one was particularly effective: Take advantage of the reverence of the population for the idea of election. To do that, Jewish Zionist candidates rarely, if ever, talk about Israel or Zionism. Instead, they only debate matters of interest to the voters. Once elected though, promoting Israel via American legislations becomes the top hidden agenda,\\nSixth, and to conclude this particular argument, the fact that one administration after another succumbed to the diktat of Jewish Zionists (thus indirectly to Israel) in matters of foreign policy and wars proves that the culture and praxis of those administrations are those of the dominant ideology and culture—Zionism.\\nAnother point to discuss is the expansion of the Jewish Zionist power. By all accounts, such an expansion is not a phenomenon but an incremental process. In his book, The Arabists: The Romance of an American Elite , Robert D. Kaplan defined the issue that I framed as a process in terms of gradual replacement of traditional diplomatic elites with new ideological elites that had no interest in the ways of the old school of diplomacy. Kaplan was unambiguous. He called these new elites by their names: Irish-Americans and Jewish-Americans.\\nKaplan\\'s viewpoint on this replacement is important to our discussion. He argued that the old elites approached the U.S.-Arab relations with an open mind and readiness for dialog, all while keeping an eye on the U.S. imperialist interests. His argument opens the door for a veritable conclusion. The two groups of post-WWII American society that Kaplan mentioned had in fact changed the dynamics of U.S. foreign policy. (It is public knowledge that both groups are known for their hostility toward Arabs and Muslims—each for his own set of religious, political, and ideological rationales.). As for the successive shares of African-Americans and Hispanics in the making of the national policy of the United States, this is another argument.\\nAs a witness to history, in early 2012, I began drafting a comprehensive analysis on the role of American Jewish Zionists in the making of U.S. policies and wars in the Arab world. In May of that year, as my work became broad in scope, I decided to seek more views on the subject. I came up with the idea to conduct several interviews where I pose the same questions. While some of the prospective interviewees declined, and others accepted but then withdrew, three prominent thinkers acclaimed for their knowledge, scholarship, and outstanding political activism graciously gave me their views.\\nThey are Francis Boyle, a professor of international law, University of Illinois, College of Law; James Petras, a professor emeritus, University of Binghamton, New York; Canadian writer and former co-editor of the online publication of Dissident Voice Kim Petersen. Professors Boyle and Petras answered my questions via phone conversations, and, Petersen via email correspondence.\\nHowever, in the weeks following the interviews, my work swelled up to such a length that it became unsuitable for internet publishing. In short, I was unable to honor my commitment to publish the interviews as planned. Today, as I thank Prof. Francis Boyle, Prof. James Petras, and Kim Petersen for sharing their invaluable insight, I apologize to them for the delay in putting the interviews out there to read.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe turning point in the emergence of Jewish Zionism as a dominant American political force came about when Iraq invaded Kuwait. (Discussing the origins and strategic complications of that invasion goes beyond the scope of this introduction.) The Jewish Zionist establishment seized the occasion, mobilized its omnipresent propaganda operatives, and led colossal media campaigns to promote military actions against Iraq. To bring their war mania to fruition, they unleashed their \"experts\" in all directions. They talked about Iraq\\'s \"formidable\" military capabilities and about Saddam\\'s one-million-man standing army ready to invade Saudi Arabia and seize its oil. They told stories about Saddam Hussein\\'s personal life, his bunkers, and his mortal \"nuclear threats\" to Israel. And they talked about Iraq\\'s threats to U.S. interests and \"allies\" in the Middle East. . . . Here is a brief account of those events.\\nOn July 25, 1990, Iraqi president Saddam Hussein met with U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie. It is on record that Glaspie gave Hussein an unambiguous but indirect greenlight to resolve Iraq\\'s problems with Kuwait militarily. On August 2, Iraq invaded Kuwait. On August 3, George H. W. Bush ordered the freezing of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets and immediately placed Iraq under hermetic embargo. Considering the prompt, extraordinary anti-Iraq measures that the United States took in the first 24 hours of that invasion, one wonders what was pushing the U.S. to move so quickly on Iraq knowing that only two days earlier, this was conducting a U.S. proxy against Iran. The observation that the U.S. did not take similar actions when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, or when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 raises many questions. What were the U.S. rationales in taking such measures? Who conceived them? Did the U.S. entrap Iraq? Why? . . .\\nThe atmosphere that followed the invasion was surrealistic. Like a lightning bolt, U.S. imperialist and Zionist forces instantly mobilized their media, talking heads, retired generals, and bogus experts on the Middle East. The deafening uproar they made and all lies they told about atrocities committed by Iraq in Kuwait hid a definite scheme: Incite for war . In the period August 2, 1990 – January 14, 1991, Israelis and Jewish Zionists from all fields appeared en mass and in every possible medium available to urge the Bush regime to give up diplomacy in favor of war. On January 15, 1991, a 30-member \"coalition\" in which the U.S. had the lion share—ninety-seven percent of the total force—attacked Iraq. By every standard and minutia of details, the war on Iraq in 1991 was an American War .\\nAt the end of a war that destroyed one of Israel\\'s Arab adversaries, George H. W. Bush might have thought of himself as America\\'s \"laureate hero\". He did not predict though that his temporary freezing of the U.S. loan guaranties to Israel, would have unleashed the Jewish Zionist establishment against him. The fact that he lost to Bill Clinton (who opposed Bush\\'s freeze, and who stated that Israel was the \"only country that paid back its debts\") indicated that American Jewish Zionists had finally reached their objective: To perfect ways to control the U.S. politics from the inside . In retrospect, it can be said that George H. W. Bush was the last non-Zionist American president. From Bill Clinton forward, U.S. presidents and their vice president became pawns in the Jewish Zionist play of power.\\nNow, as the United States was preparing for war with Iraq to \"liberate\" Kuwait, thousands of antiwar activists and intellectuals from a wide spectrum of political convictions spoke loudly against it. But no one could have ever beaten Patrick J. Buchanan\\'s memorable words about how American Jewish Zionists and Israel were pushing for that war. He said, \\'\\'There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner .\\'\\' [2] With that, Buchanan hit the proverbial nail on the head. A.M. Rosenthal, a ringleader of U.S. Zionist journalism could not bear what he heard. In a rebuttal, he unleashed an acerbic attack against Buchanan. His weapon of argument, so to speak, was the stale and trite accusation of \"antisemitism\".\\nWhining, Rosenthal twisted Buchanan\\'s clear words and went on to imply that Buchanan was in effect engaging in an \"anti-Jewish\" tirade. He re-interpreted Buchanan\\'s words and cast them in a standard Zionistic fashion. He wrote that Buchanan\\'s intention was \\'\\'The Jews are trying to drag us into war. Only Jews want war. Israeli Jews want war to save Israel\\'s hide. American Jews who talk of military action against Iraq want war because it would suit Israeli interests. They are willing to spill American blood for Israeli interests.\" [3]\\nBy inserting the word, \"Jew\" in his reply, Rosenthal and the New York Times behind him spat on the face of U.S. political reality under the tight grip of Zionism. We need not waste our breath on Rosenthal\\'s petty tactic. His clear objective was to distract from the central issue, which is, Buchanan\\'s opposition to the planned war against Iraq was unrelated to the religious denomination of those who were promoting it. Rather he was unmistakably referring to their political identity.\\nStill, Buchanan was honest. He pointed the finger to Israel and its \"Amen corner\" because that was the truth. The fact that most Israelis and \"Amen corners\" happened to be of Jewish faith was nonissue. To conclude, it is evident that Buchanan, a dreamer of an American \"republic\" not \"empire\", could not stand by idle while seeing the United States sheepishly fastened to the yoke of Zionism and gutlessly prostrating before a tiny settler state, Israel.\\nBuchanan did not stop there. Truthful and resolute, he dared to describe in categorical terms the pitiful condition of the U.S. Congress vis-à-vis Israel and American Jewish Zionists. He dubbed it as \"An Israeli-occupied territory\" [4]. Buchanan powerfully hit the target in such a way that countless cowardly American politicians would dare not think, let alone say. Notice that Buchanan had placed Israel before its U.S. \"amen corner\". I view this as a statement. He clearly implied that Israel is the primary decision maker. Did that also imply that U.S. Zionist groups (amen corner) are puppets moved by Israel? Most likely, if so, which has more power in setting the U.S. world agenda and policies: Israel or American Jewish Zionists? Dialectically, the answer should be Israel by means of its \"amen corner\\'.\\nNow, in December 1991, Jim Lehrer (a former co-anchor of The Macneil/Lehrer NewsHour, and later sole anchor of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer ) interviewed Pat Buchanan. It is important to mention, that Jim Lehrer has monopolized a significant position funded by federal tax money for over 30 years starting in 1975. Is that an issue? Yes, and to debate it, the following applies. Whenever a specific group of people, be they Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheist, duopoly party apparatchiks, etc., keeps an important public post for such a long duration, the implication is unescapable: the group controls that post because of its embedded importance. . . . But more important, they have the power to keep it.\\nNonetheless, when a specific group continues to hold, throughout time, important positions inside public corporations, agencies, and branches of the U.S. government, a paradigm emerges. Either the group controls said corporations directly—that is why it is able to do what they want. Or, it controls them indirectly by controlling first who appoints the board of trustees and sets corporate policies and appointees. At any rate, considering this type of control, the assumption that such group has power over the government and its public corporations is reasonable.\\nAdditionally, the issue of monopoly of news is critical in another respect. It means that someone within the context of U.S. imperialism has decided that the U.S. public discourse must conform to predetermined patterns. In these patterns, issues such as Israel, Zionism, Palestine, U.S. imperialism in the Middle East, wars, etc., are designed to move only on linear grounds without ever touching the core of the matter.\\nBefore continuing, I must state that Lehrer\\'s political views are not a subject to discuss vis-à-vis his program. For one, the NewsHour program is not about the personal views of presenters—it is about information prepared for the public from a public corporation. Second, whether Lehrer had sympathies for Israel or Zionism is nonissue because most viewers expect neutral discussions regardless of who delivers them. Nevertheless, a situation such as this has a consequence affecting the special relations between the narrated news/comments, the people who deliver them, and the people who hear them.\\nFirstly, planning news delivery to attain specific results is a good technique for those in the business of indoctrination. Psychology and perception are the areas of expertise that news planners depend on to disseminate certain news and analyses. To be sure, these planners know that most viewers have no special or personal stakes on events happening in other countries. Still, the immediate consequence that controlled news and commentaries could generate is easy to predict. They also know they can seep to the viewers pre-conceived ideas through pleasant dialogs, affable manners, appearance of neutrality, and clever circumlocutions.\\nTo be fair to Lehrer, he was consistent in making intelligent questions. However, he was also consistent at doing something else. He would calibrate his questions in such a way as not to reveal new truths or solicit critical replies that could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived so as not to be crossed. It is pragmatic to say that the observance of these boundaries would nicely serve the Zionist and imperialist discourse. In essence, a practice thusly followed is a preemptive mechanism of control cloaked as a professional presentation.\\nNow, in his interview, Lehrer played dumb when he asked Buchanan about his bold characterization of the Congress. He phrased his question as follows, \"You have also said that Congress is an Israeli-occupied territory. Now, what do you mean by that ?\" [Italics are mine]\\nCOMMENT: Semantically as much as politically, Buchanan\\'s figure of speech was terse and unequivocal. He plainly meant that the Congress observes Israel\\'s agenda and acts accordingly. There was no need for Buchanan to say anything further because what he said had (and still has) basis in verifiable facts. With a question such as, \"what do you mean by that\" Lehrer was not seeking a rational reply from Buchanan. The form and content of the question had the objective of wanting to entrap Buchanan, make him retract, or at least contradict himself to show inconsistency. In essence, Lehrer had simply tried to deny that Israel controls the Congress through its \"amen corner\" because his \"what do you mean\" indicated astonishment rather than request for explanation. [5]\\nTo wrap up the issue, without exclusion, any denial of the Jewish Zionist control of the United States is a farce. Take Abraham H. Foxman of the infamous Anti-Defamation League as an example. Foxman authored a master‑deceptive propaganda book that he called, \" The Deadliest Lies : The Israeli Lobby and the Myth of Jewish Control. [Italics are mine]. First, Foxman lied. He knew very well that the Jewish [Zionist] control is not a myth but a pervasive reality. Second, but most important, the problem is not the abstract \"Jewish control\" but the specific—Jewish Zionist control. This can be explained using a current universal truth: hundreds of thousands of Jews from all nationalities actively oppose Zionism on political, religious, ethical, historical, and ideological grounds.\\nFoxman\\'s denial means one of two things. Either he is a parochial charlatan when the subject is the undisputed power of American Jewish Zionism, or he is very ignorant of the history of Zionism , which is impossible. Either way, Foxman\\'s business is propaganda, demagogy, and deception. Incidentally, Foxman\\'s denial looks very similar to what some Arabs do in the Middle East. Villagers—but even some city folks—try to fend off \"envy\" by following an eon-old superstition. They fix a drawing on a wall in their shops or homes showing the palm of an open hand with an open eye in its center. It appears that Foxman and his associates have their own superstition. By decrying the \"deadliest lies\" against American Jewish Zionists, they try to fend off the accusation or the \"envy\" that Jews—specifically, Jewish Zionists—have power and influence.\\nOf substance, did Foxman not learn or did anyone inform him about what John Foster Dulles told William Knowland (a pro-Zionist senator from California) back in February 1957? In an exchange about the proposed sanctions to get Israel out of Egyptian territory occupied by Israel in the Suez War, Dulles pronounced these prophetic words, \"We cannot have all our policies made in Jerusalem . . .\" [6]. That was in 1957. Today, all those who deride or deny the charge that Israel has a say on U.S. foreign policy and wars in the Middle East must prove that those who are making this charge are misinformed or just lying.\\nInterestingly, years after Buchanan made that statement, the successive events proved his sharp assessment and political perspicacity. Two people vindicated his characterization of Capitol Hills as an Israeli-occupied territory\" and both used his words to make the point. The first is a former CIA officer Philip Giraldi, and the second is Philip Weiss, founder of MondoWeiss Website. In an article he wrote in 2011, Giraldi pointed to the Congress as, \" It’s Still Occupied Territory \". Weiss titled a piece he wrote in 2015 as such: \" Capitol Hill — still Israeli-occupied territory \".\\nAt this point, do American Jewish Zionists control the United States? Do they control it as polity or only the political system? Do they have real influence in setting U.S. foreign policy and wars against the Arab and Muslim nations? Or maybe all this talk is no more than baseless allegations?\\nNEXT\\nPart 2: Discussion\\nPart 3: Interview with Francis Boyle\\nPart 4: Interview with James Petras\\nPart 5: Interview with Kim Petersen\\nNOTES\\nJimmy carter, Speaking frankly about Israel and Palestine , Los Angeles Times, 8 December 2006 Pat Buchanan, The McLaughlin Group, Aug 26, 1990, Quote: d in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, What They Said: Israel and Its \"Amen Corner\" , February 1992 ON MY MIND; Forgive Them Not , The New York Times, 14 September 1990 Quote: d in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, Is Congress an Israeli-Occupied Territory ?, July 1995 The Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, What They Said: Israel and Its \"Amen Corner\" , Feb. 1992 David Tal, editor, The 1956 War: Collusion and Rivalry in the Middle East, Frank Cass Publishers, 2001, p. 40'],\n",
       " ['Knife Review: Kellam Hawk Is Traditional Puukko Design with Modern Materials | Survival',\n",
       "  \"(Before It's News)\\nby Leon Pantenburg\\nI bought this knife to review. At the time of publication, Kellem Knives had no sponsorship relationship with Survivalcommonsense.com. I’m a sucker for old time knife designs, especially when they are re-created with modern materials. IMO, this makes for a time-tested, utility design that will do the job.\\nI particularly like the Scandinavian Puukko design, so that’s why I got a Kellam Hawk.\\nThe Kellam Hawk\\nThe puukko is a Finnish knife, and the name lends itself to the Finnish word “puukotta,” which means “to stab/knife.” The prefix, “puu” means “wood” in Finnish. The design of the puukko is attributed to the indigenous Sami people, who created several knives to use for day to day tasks; the puukko was the smaller option, used to skin fish or animals.\\n“Although historical records vary, the puukko dates back about 1000 years. Both men and women carried (and carry) puukkos, although the sizes change depending on the person, as the puukko handle is meant to fit the hand size of the user. (From: EDC History: Pukko – A simple knife with a rich history.)\\nThe old design is getting some attention from modern knifemakers. I recently reviewed the Battle Horse Knives Feather Stick, another knife with the Puukko design, and it worked out really well.\\nHere’s the Hawk’s specs:\\nProduct Details:\\nBlade: 3″ Carbon Steel Handle: 4.5″ Stained Curly Birch Full Tang construction Dangler-style leather sheath Total Length : 7.5″ Grind: Convex is my all-time, go-to favorite grind , but scandi is a close second or third. For a beginner, it is the easiest to learn to sharpen on. The bevel is sharpening guide – all you do is lay it flat on a whetstone and hone away.\\nThe scandi is also a great woodworking grind, and a practical choice for someone looking for a bushcraft knife.\\nThe Hawk handle fits my large hands very well.\\nHandle: I have big hands – size large gloves – and many otherwise excellent knives don’t work for me because the handle is too short. I don’t like two or three finger grips. IMO, they don’t give a secure grip for hard work, and I’m concerned they might twist in my hand.\\nThe 4.5-inch handle fits my hand really, really well. It is made of dyed curly birch, a common wood in Russia and Scandinavia, with nice figure. The wood makes a handle that doesn’t transfer heat or cold. This is a consideration for a knife that will be used in Finland’s frigid winter.\\nThe diameter is large, which gives me a good, solid grip. When wet or slimy from cleaning fish, or bloody from butchering, the handle seems to get “grippier.”\\nA comfortable, safe handle is a really important aspect of a user knife. Pretty doesn’t cut it (pun intended) when there are lengthy cutting tasks to be done.\\nSteel: The high carbon steel holds a wicked edge. I don’t know exactly what it is, but the Hawk’s steel held up nicely to normal cutting and bushcraft tasks.\\nTraditionally, Blade materials can vary from the three-layer approach, which combines strong and flexible steels, to composite designs. Most are made with Finnish steel, Ovako 100Cr6, which is equivalent to U.S 52100 bearing steel, according to Nordic knife blog Nordiska Kniva r.\\nSpine: I would like the spine to be ground at a 90-degree angle, like an ice skate, so it could be used for processing tinder or scraping a ferro rod. It isn’t. But a few passes on a grinder could fix that.\\nSheath: The dangler-style, form-fitted leather sheath holds the knife securely. Almost too securely. It requires a slight twist to loosen the Hawk. It’s a consideration – the knife won’t fall out, but it’s a two-hand job to remove it. This might be a deal-breaker for some users.\\nI find this annoying, but you can get used to the tight sheath.\\nFull tang construction with a brass bolster. I prefer a full tang on any rigid blade knife, even though I’ve never needed that extra strength. In fact, one of my favorite user knives, the Mora 840 Companion , has a plastic handle and a three-quarter tang.\\nFor the strongest knife available, though, get a full tang.\\nHand made in Finland.\\nThe Hawk is a user knife, able to handle a variety of tasks.\\nIn actual use , the Hawk lives up to the user reputation of the Puukko knives. It went along on Fremont District’s Webelos Woods, a Boy Scout outing, recently.

       " ['Donald Trump\\x92s Moment: Will It Last?      : Information',\n",
       "  ' Donald Trump\\x92s Moment: Will It Last? By Lawrence Davidson\\nNovember 11, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - On Election Day, Hillary Clinton, with all her data specialists and poll gurus, came up short. The morning after, they didn\\x92t know what hit them \\x96 that is, the unexpected fact that statistical data and real life don\\x92t always coincide. People often tell pollsters what they think the pollsters want to hear, or what media tells them is the expected answer, while clandestinely harboring different opinions that they share only with their family, friends and drinking buddies.\\nHillary Clinton and the Democratic leadership, as well as their Republican Party counterparts, represent a well-entrenched political system. That system is responsive to lobbies or interest groups and not disgruntled citizens. What is more, none of the country\\x92s political bosses can see beyond this system and how it relates to their own political needs.\\nDuring the 2016 election campaign that near sightedness led to a fatal misinterpretation: that Trump represented only hooligans and \\x93deplorable\\x94 people who could not themselves possibly add up to a \\x93silent majority.\\x94 Thinking along these lines, Clinton and the overconfident Democratic establishment made a perhaps unconscious decision to let this apparent bozo Trump lose the election, rather than they, the Democrats, going out there and doing what was necessary to win it.\\nFor instance, they apparently did not bother to design a message to compete for the votes of those listening to Trump. They did not take into consideration the historically observable fact that millions of Americans had, over the last 50 years, seemed to give up on politics because they saw the system as unresponsive. The Democrat establishment did not respond to this phenomenon. Indeed, they made sure Bernie Sanders, the only Democratic who was trying to respond, would fail.\\nA Deep Division\\nThe truth is that the United States is a very deeply divided country, and has been since the 1960s. The division is multifaceted and involves cultural issues that touch on gender, race and lifestyle; and class issues such as job creation and trade treaties. Also, the city mouse/country mouse divide is very real and very deep.\\nMuch of rural white America has various degrees of negative feelings toward African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and anyone else who does not look and talk like them. These are the same sort of people who once hated kids with long hair, afros, and a preference for marijuana over whiskey.\\nAll of these disgruntled ones, like those millions of Christian Fundamentalists out there, have never gone away. They were just waiting \\x96 even if some of them didn\\x92t know it. They were waiting for a \\x93hero,\\x94 and when he appeared, they elected him president.\\nSo the divisions are real and they are not new. And no one in the political establishment, Democrat or Republican, addressed them. That opened the door for Mr. Trump.\\nThat means Trump\\x92s victory should not properly be seen as a Republican Party victory. Trump just exploited the party label. In truth, he has destroyed the Republican Party as we traditionally knew it. Its future is very uncertain.\\nWhat Can We Expect?\\nDonald Trump has made a fetish out of being unpredictable, which, at the very least, is bad for the stock market. Inevitably, however, there will be signs that give a hint as to what might be expected.\\nFor instance, Trump will have to name a cabinet. Interestingly enough, most of those who will be available, be they private-sector business people or right-wing goofballs like Sarah Palin and Chris Christie, are creatures of the standing political system. They have no real interest in reforming current ways of doing things as against profiting from them \\x96 which, of course, is a form of business as usual.\\nThere will be tremendous pressure on Donald Trump to go along with and slot himself into the existing political system in Washington (as did President Obama). At every turn, in Congress and in the bureaucracies, there will be no one to deal with but systems people.\\nBeyond a limited number of exclusively executive functions, Trump needs standing political arrangements to operate. Thus, if he suddenly turns relatively conventional, no one should be too surprised. What about all that campaign rebel talk? Well, remember, he is unpredictable which, in his case, goes well with also being a consistent liar.\\nTrump promised a lot during the campaign. He was going to rebuild the inner cities, the military, all of the nation\\x92s bridges, etc. And he would do so while simultaneously lowering taxes. Short of bankrupting the country, this is fiscally impossible.\\nHe promised to remake foreign policy, which, being within the realm of executive power, may be more doable. Will he try to cancel international trade agreements? Will he pull out of NATO? Will he dump the Zionists and the Saudis? Will he ally with the Russians?\\nThese are interesting questions. What about global warming, which he claims not to believe in? How about international law and our relationship to the United Nations? It\\x92s all up for grabs, and that worries a lot of people \\x96 very few of whom voted for Trump.\\nMany of those who did vote for Donald Trump don\\x92t care about any of this. They voted for him because he appeared to stand against the political system they hate. They want the country ethnically cleansed of Mexicans, the government downsized and, culturally, the clock turned back to the 1950s. If he does not do this, he will appear to have become part of that hateful system, and his fans may well end up hating him too.\\nLawrence Davidson is a retired professor of history from West Chester University in West Chester PA.

       " ['Just Saying Common Sense is not Common!',\n",
       "  'Common Sense as defined by the Cambridge Academic Text Dictionary is the ability to use good judgement in making decisions to live in a reasonable and safe way. While that may have sounded reasonable and safe back in the sixties and seventies when I was growing up, I find myself at risk daily based on the judgement of others who make decisions that have lasting and irreversible consequences. Ever since I started writing sporadically, beginning in the early eighties for small newspapers like the Chicago Daily News and the Chicago Defender, I have enjoyed the opportunity to research, find and expose resources. I started with “Canons on Careers”, which was my weekly contribution to those readers who were looking for career and employment opportunities and financial aid to pay for, and in some cases get paid for attending college. When I started “Just Saying” for the Guardian Liberty Voice in 2014, I was motivated to express my personal opinions about the world around me as I saw it through my limited world view. As I see the local landscape that I travail everyday, and the world at large portrayed to me and others by media moguls and highly paid infotainment charlatans, I write to vent my frustrations and fears that the world around me has been dumb down to the point where Common Sense will never again be Common!\\nSince I grew up in public housing and went to public schools, I have never really thought of myself as an intellectual or the brightest candle on the cake. I never ever thought that those around me would fall to such a level of illiteracy where the adults and the majority of inner city youth and young adults would struggle to read and write at an eight grade level or higher. I am in the business of hiring people daily and 7 out of ten people who I put to work daily cannot properly fill out an application or transfer information from a Resume’ to the application. The fact that illiteracy has been broken down to three categories, functional, cultural and moral doesn’t ease my anxieties as I see relatively modest and simple differences of opinion escalate to levels of violence and idiocy that cost people their limbs and their lives. While Functional illiteracy plagues over 24 million Americans, with over a million of them graduating from high school with a diploma the value of a wet food stamp, Cultural illiteracy is the lack of knowledge of the significant historical events that shaped this country which obscures the lessons learned ( or Not learned )! Moral illiteracy completes the three forms of illiteracy, and to my view causes the senseless and heinous callousness that prevails in the United States today! Our young are not taught the moral values of the old and therefore disrespect the old, value the new and care more about the self than the community of you! That said, how could common sense ever factor into the equation ! There is no ME in common and the only sense that counts is mine!\\nI’m Just Saying……What’s a fella to do? I live in a country that just elected a guy named Donald Trump, President, who says he represents the people and that he is the change agent that is going to make America GREAT again. Yes, this is the guy who going to bring back all the jobs that our poor trade polices gave away. Yes, this is the guy who says Climate Change is a hoax and all those coal mining jobs are coming back to West Virginia, Pennsylvania and all those lily white towns who used to thrive on those deadly but well paying jobs. This is also the guy who is the protege’ of Roy Cohn (the instigator and arbitrator of McCarthyism) who caused many people to commit suicide and destroyed countless lives with tactics of fear using race, misogyny and communism! In a NUTshell, Donald Trump cohnned many of America’s so-called common folk into thinking he was with them and one of them! Yep, a millionaire/billionaire (who knows, he never revealed his taxes) who claims to be a commoner! It took me a long time Dad but now I get it…….Common Sense is not Common!!!!'],\n",

Practically not just Hillary, but whole Clinton family is going to jail! \\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings.

Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” \\nDespite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014. \\nSean Davis at The Federalist notes, “the bulk of the charitable work lauded by the Clinton Foundation’s boosters — the distribution of drugs to impoverished people in developing countries — is no longer even performed by the Clinton Foundation. Those activities were spun off in 2010 and are now managed by the Clinton Health Access Initiative, a completely separate non-profit organization.” (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Deceived IRS On Tax Exemption From The Start) \\nAs first reported by The Daily Caller, the IRS launched an investigation into the Clinton Foundation this past July after 64 House Republicans called the foundation a “lawless ‘pay-to-play’ enterprise that has been operating under a cloak of philanthropy for years and should be investigated” in a letter to the IRS, FBI and Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \\nThese Clintons are nastier than El Chapo Guzman family members! \\nBut El Chapo never portrait himself as some huge persona, Clintons are with a mask of Mother Theresa but with heart and soul of a Russian mobster! \\nIf you agree, please share and comment below. \\n'],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site – Advertisement – \\nFrom Nation of Change \\nTrump’s unexpected election has created political space for a new agenda . \\nThere is a critical lesson to learn from this election: People will only take so much before they rise up and fight back. This voter revolt has been brewing for a while. If the Democrats had possessed the capacity to be self-critical, they would have seen it coming, but I suspect that despite the growing unrest they thought they had everything under control. The party has been getting away with manipulation of the debates and primaries, control of the commercial media, empty promises of a better future and blaming everyone but themselves for decades. That era of hubris is over. The election of Trump was not because people like him; it was a revolt against the Democratic Party, represented this year by Clinton. It had little to do with her being a woman and everything to do with her representing the political elites who serve Wall Street interests instead of the people. – Advertisement – The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) played a major role. Workers in states where manufacturing jobs were moved out of the country felt betrayed by President Obama and didn’t trust Clinton’s new, weak opposition to the TPP, especially after the Democratic National Committee defeated Sanders’ anti-TPP amendment and his campaign. Sanders and WikiLeaks further exposed the Democrat’s fake populism and corruption. \\nUnfortunately, the election of Trump, who was perceived as “the outsider,” will unleash even worse policies than Clinton would have enacted, with the exception perhaps of foreign policy. Clinton’s support for a no-fly zone over Syria would have heightened tension with Russia and increased the risk of a major war. Trump says he’ll work things out with Russia. Members of the international peace community are relieved. \\nEarly indications of the Trump agenda, however, signal lower taxes for the wealthy and corporations and greater military spending, which will likely trigger greater austerity measures for the rest of us. He intends to weaken the less-than-adequate current measures in place to mitigate the climate crisis. Trump’s plans for health care are disastrous. Opening the sale of health insurance across state lines may lower prices but at the expense of coverage. Block grants for Medicaid mean states will sacrifice coverage in times of economic stress. \\nTrump’s unexpected election has created political space for a new agenda. This is a critical moment when the people must continue their revolt by defining the agenda to create an economy that works for everyone, achieve universal health care, end systemic racism, protect the planet, stop wars and more. Now more than ever, we must be clear about the solutions we want such as taxing wealth, improved Medicare for all, jobs with living wages, and a clean energy economy by 2030. \\nThe largest movement of movements against rigged corporate trade deals just stopped the TPP. This is a victory of the people over transnational corporations. Let’s build on that victory by continuing to rise up and put an end to plutocracy. \\nIn the words of the recently deceased Leonard Cohen, “Democracy is coming to the USA.” \\n[embedded content] '],\n",

       "  'Nov 6, 2016 Axel Tillmann Opinion \\nThere are plenty of talented Russians working in U.S. tech companies. Such partnerships are sure to create wealth and be beneficial for both countries. \\nRussians have a high chance of succeeding in Silicon Valley if they surround themselves with others whose talents complement their own. Photo: Theory and Practice \\nAlthough it may come as a surprise to many, Russians have long had a presence in the U.S., particularly in Silicon Valley . It’s a mistake, especially for businesspeople, to trust the picture politicians and the media paint of Russia. Many Russian IT companies view Silicon Valley as the promised land, and many Russians have much to contribute here. \\nMost Russians arrive in the U.S. with a strong education and a different way of looking at the world that enables them to “design” products. I speak from experience. In one of my startups, I partnered with a Russian named Vladimir who quietly worked away in his office. Occasionally he would get up from his chair and step to a white board to sketch out his design plans. Eventually there would be the sound of his keyboard clicking as he produced on his screen what he had designed in his mind. Eventually we created a great product. There are plenty of Vladimirs working away in U.S. tech companies. Recommended: \" Russians in America: How to find success in Silicon Valley \" \\nIn other cases, whole Russian companies have found success in the U.S. market. One company worth highlighting is Kaspersky Lab . The Moscow-based firm was a dark horse in the software security business, up against such competition as McAfee and Symantec. Yet today, Kaspersky’s market share is in the top eight of all vendors in the sector, and it is twice the size of McAfee’s. Kaspersky is an important case study in what it takes to be truly successful in the market. The company had a great product, but what made the firm successful was its brilliant go-to-market strategy, crafted in cooperation with North American market managers. \\nWisely, Kaspersky’s leadership chose to tap experts in the local market to craft the company’s strategy rather than trying to do it by themselves. I’m not ashamed to admit that as a German immigrant, I started down the path of launching a product with a limited sense of marketing skills, believing in The Field of Dreams theory, “if we build it, they will come.” Unfortunately, that’s just not so. After a long and painful journey of my own, I finally came around to seeing the benefits of hiring professionals who know how to play the game, but this required that I make a change in my way of thinking. \\nI have met many talented Russians during the last five years and they are hungry to succeed; but most need the same kind of awakening I had in order to create their own success stories. Not everyone will become Google co-founder Sergey Brin, or even Birger Steen, who created the extremely successful software platform Parallels, but the opportunity to be a success is available to all who can combine their love for technological achievements with excellence in marketing and sales. Here are few more examples of innovators with Russian who have found that success: Valentin Gapontsev (IPG Photonics), Yuri Milner (investor), Stepan Pachikov (Evernote), David Yan (ABBYY). \\nSilicon Valley is truly a magical place, and anyone who comes to work here learns quickly that the main advantage of the Valley is the network that exists. Russians have a high chance of succeeding in Silicon Valley if they surround themselves with others whose talents complement their own. One way to do this is to join a networking organization. Two of the larger networking organizations for Russian entrepreneurs and developers are AMBAR (American Business Association of Russian Speaking Processionals) and the Global Technology Symposium, led by the legendary Alexandra Johnson. \\nWhile current geopolitics is encouraging Russian entrepreneurs to take another look at China , culturally Russians are closer to the U.S. mentality . In the long-term, Russia and Russians have little to gain from China. What interests do the Chinese have in helping Russia develop a culture of innovation? Chinese companies have a clear track record of observing the ideas and the scientific research of others, and then reverse engineering it to create their own products. \\nI encourage investors to embrace Russian entrepreneurs and help them find a U.S. partner. Only if we encourage this free entrepreneurial spirit can we stop the long-standing intellectual brain drain that Russia has experienced for so many years. \\nLet’s work together to make some money. \\nThe opinion of the author may not necessarily reflect the position of Russia Direct or its staff. \\nThe article was initially published in Russia Direct’s special project “ U.S.-Russia Shared Frontiers .\" Tags: '],\n",

There’s no evidence to support the Republican nominee’s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. \\nThe latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city’s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. “One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn’t have a voice,” says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. “We’ve had legal immigrants who’ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.” Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the “broken immigration system in this country.” \\nNoncitizen voting isn’t as radical as it might sound. For more than half of U.S. history, from 1776 until the 1920s, noncitizens were widely permitted to participate in elections. “We had 40 states that used to allow it,” says Ron Hayduk, an associate professor of political science at San Francisco State University. “Immigrants could vote, not just in local elections,” he says. “They could even run for office—and did win office.” The hope, Hayduk says, was that immigrants would feel more invested in civic life if they were able to participate in American democracy. \\nDo you think Democrats would want non-citizens to vote if they tended to vote Republican? \\nOf course not. \\nThe Democrat party is a criminal enterprise and they’ll do whatever they have to do to win. shares '],\n",

       "  'Comments Actor Steven Seagal has just stood up for America, while the rest of Hollywood remains silent. This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial. Then, she called millions of hardworking Americans “deplorable.” As if that weren’t enough, NFL players throughout the country have been blatantly disrespecting the American flag. Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.” What do you think of Seagal’s comments?

       " ['Pepsi Pledges to Cut Sugar: Replacing One Addictive Substance With Another',\n",
       "  'Far too often, artificial sweeteners replace one addictive substance with another. Recently, The Pepsi Corporation announced that it is pledging to cut sugar from its products, raising the percentage of its single-serving beverages with 100 or fewer calories to 66 percent by 2025. Currently, that percentage is less than 40.\\nHow are they planning to do this while still manufacturing and marketing a profitable addictive drink? Artificial sweeteners. Last year, responding to changing tastes, Pepsi pledged to reduce the number of their products with the artificial sweetener Aspartame in them. However, in September they actually re-introduced Aspartame into several products. Because the market craves that sweet taste and so long as that is the case profitable flavor companies will figure out how to meet that demand.\\nThe huge problem for people trying to lose weight is that artificial sweeteners undermine that goal. I find they are more dangerous than sugary drinks because it is easy for people to think they are getting a freebie—something sweet that will not impact their weight. How many chronically overweight people do you know who live on diet beverages?\\nWhat is happening? …Well, a few things.\\nFirst, when the sweet taste hits the tongue the body cues up the insulin response system, same as for sugar. Only, within minutes, the body is flooded with insulin, but there are no calories for that insulin to process. This breaks the body’s feedback mechanism and contributes to insulin resistance and Type-II diabetes.\\nThe added danger of anything that elevates the body’s insulin level is that we now know insulin blocks the hormone leptin in the brain. Leptin is critical for weight loss. It is the hormone that signals the body that it is full and needs to get moving. When leptin is blocked, the body feels relentlessly hungry and lethargic—and there is no amount of caffeinated diet cola that will fix that. Artificial sweeteners also put the body through the same high and insulin crash, making the body crave more sugar or caffeine to wake back up. Anything that sets you up to leave you feeling wanting is ultimately going to sabotage your weight goals.\\nSecond, drinking artificial sweeteners keeps cravings alive. Cravings are a function of a brain that has been overstimulated by sugar to the point that it has taken some pleasure receptors offline to cope. This is a neurological process called downregulation and you only have to eat the average amount of sugar Americans consume, 22 teaspoons daily, for three weeks for it to happen. The remaining receptors in the brain’s nucleus accumbens then demand more sugar just to stimulate them back to baseline functioning and now you have a sugar addiction. Artificial sweeteners do not heal that cycle. The sweet flavor jacks the brain the same way and triggers the same neurological response: MORE. The brain demands more.\\nTherefore, the final result of eating artificial sweeteners should come as no surprise. Studies show that people who eat artificial sweeteners will eat more sugar later when it is offered, AND more total calories. Which makes sense. The body received a message that calories were coming, but none came. The next time calories are on offer the body is going to consume as many possible—and try to hold onto them. Because it is now nervous about your food source.\\nRemember, we may live in a land of plenty, but for the majority of our species’ existence food was scarce. Our bodies operate from that place. In addition, when leptin is blocked by elevated insulin we are primed to be looking to consume calories anyway.\\nUltimately, I do not advocate the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages for my Bright Line Eating boot camp members because they keep the brain oriented around and expecting that fix. In order for the brain to heal from sugar addiction, the cycle has to be broken.\\nThe good news is if allowed to heal, receptors do replenish. Cravings diminish. Baseline insulin levels drop, and leptin gets back on board to make us feel full and eager to be active.\\nI try to encourage people to think of Aspartame, NutraSweet, and Saccharine, not as free treats, but as methadone. They are simply an additive substitute that fully keeps the addiction alive and prevents you from living how I want all of my Bright Line Eaters to live—Happy, Thin and, most of all, Free.\\nWritten by Susan Peirce Thompson, Ph.D.\\n(Edited by Cherese Jackson)\\nSources:\\nBright Line Eating: The Science of Living Happy, Thin and Free\\nFortune: PepsiCo Sets a Global Target to Reduce Sugar in Its Soft Drinks\\nSusan Peirce Thompson, Ph.D. is a psychology professor, a brain and cognitive scientist, and an expert in the psychology of eating.

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nUpdate: RUSSIAN PM APPOINTS DEPUTY MINISTER YELIN AS ACTING RUSSIAN ECONOMY MINISTER – IFAX \\n* * * \\nIn an unexpected move, Russian Economy Minister Alexey Ulyukayev was detained Monday on suspicion of taking a $2 million bribe in return for his ministry’s support for a major oil company deal, Russia’s Investigative Committee said. The minister is in custody and awaiting charges. \\nAlexey Ulyukaev \\n“The circumstances of the crime are connected with Alexey Ulyukayev, who occupies a public post in the Russian Federation, receiving $2 million on November 14 for the positive assessment provided by the Economic Development Ministry that allowed Rosneft to complete the deal on purchasing the government’s 50 percent stake in Bashneft,” Svetlana Petrenko, deputy head of the Investigative Committee, said in an official statement. \\nPresident Vladimir Putin named Ulyukayev, at the time a first deputy governor of Bank of Russia, economy minister in June 2013; it is unclear what prompted his fall from grace. \\nThe case comes as Rosneft is preparing a mandatory offer to buy out minorities in Bashneft , where it purchased a 50.08 percent stake for 329.69 billion rubles ($5 billion). Rosneft’s Oct. 12 purchase from the government was made at a premium to the market, or 3,706.4 rubles for each common share it bought. Bashneft shares closed at 3,480 rubles in Moscow on Nov. 14, or 6.1 percent below the purchase price \\nThe Bashneft deal, around which the charges against Ulyukayev revolve, is not going to be revised during the probe, Petrenko told RIA Novosti. \\n“The necessary investigative actions concerning Ulyukayev are under way,” the Investigative Committee’s spokesperson said quoted by RT . Ulyukayev was detained in the act of taking a bribe amid an investigative experiment, Petrenko revealed, as cited by RIA Novosti. “Ulyukayev was caught red-handed when receiving a bribe,” she said. According to Petrenko, the minister resorted to threats, attempting to extort the money from Rosneft officials. \\nThe experiment was prompted by evidence law enforcement obtained by wiretapping Ulyukayev’s cell phone and those of his entourage, a source told RIA Novosti. Petrenko said that a criminal case has been opened under part 6 of Article 290 of the Russian Criminal Code, which covers “large-scale bribery.” \\nUlyukayev has been under investigation by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) for over a year, a source told RIA Novosti. \\n“The minister has been monitored by FSB agents for more than a year. It is unclear if he was suspected from the beginning of what he is accused now, but he has definitely been observed for more than a year,” he said. \\nPetrenko told RIA Novosti that the Bashneft deal, around which the charges against Ulyukayev revolve, is not going to be revised during the probe. “The acquisition of Bashneft stock was made in accordance with the law and is not the subject of a criminal investigation,” she said. \\nMore details on the arrest from RT: \\nPursuant to Russian law, Ulyukayev faces a maximum penalty of a fine ranging from 80 to 100 times the sum of the bribe. In addition to this, if found guilty, he would be stripped of the right to serve in certain state positions or engage in certain activities for eight to 15 years. \\nAlternatively, the law says the suspect may face from eight to 15 years behind bars and a fine of 70 times the sum of the bribe, or would have to serve the prison term without paying monetary compensation. \\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the accusations brought against Ulyukayev were “very serious” and required “very serious proof.” \\n“In any case, only a court can decide,” Peskov said, adding that he did not know if President Vladimir Putin was aware of the minister’s arrest. \\nIn October, Russia’s largest oil company, Rosneft, purchased the state-owned stake in a major regional oil company, Bashneft, for about $5.3 billion. The deal was approved by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, although back in September, President Vladimir Putin expressed his concerns over the potential takeover of one state-controlled company by another. \\n“Probably it’s not the best option when one company under state control acquires another purely state company,” Putin said in an interview with Bloomberg. He added however, that the biggest bid would win as Russia “cannot discriminate against market participants, not a single one of them.” As the deal was finalized, Ulyukayev said there was another competitor to acquire the stake, but Rosneft had outbid that offer. \\nIt is unclear who Ulyukayev’s replacement will be during the criminal proceeding.

       "  \"(Before It's News)\\nA new year coming up, a new administration being sworn in, and new threats emerging, so will this be a winter like no other? Ice storms, power outages, mass shootings, financial crisis’s, possible attacks by other countries and civil unrest all loom large in the new year.\\nThe nation’s power grids, yes plural because there are three of them are in disrepair, and much of the grid system relies entirely on computer systems, which it seems, are hacked on a daily basis. Russia is stirring and making war noises, North Korea has failed to launch but they keep trying and they will get it right soon enough, and then there is Iran running their fingernails down the chalkboard trying to get our attention. Iran wants a war because it takes the focus off of just how badly treated their people are and it always ends up being about money and power, so why not start a war is their thinking.\\nAll in the name of something are wars started, wars are profitable, and they cover up a lot of atrocities committed by all parties, the fog of war, and all that. This winter we may or may not be in a war much may depend on just how the new administration handles things, however.\\nYou cast your vote and pray for the best, of course, there is much more you must do. You as an individual and as a family or even as a community must prepare, because you may have to go it alone for days, weeks, or even months if the grid is hacked and shut down, or if we are attacked or if a natural disaster strikes. The world is in turmoil and much of what happens is simply out of your control, what you can control, however, is how you prepare and react.\\nYou have to be prepared to live without your local, state or federal governments help. No garbage pickup, no clean water piped in, no natural gas for heat or cooking, and no snowplows patrolling the streets. Police will prioritize so that recent break-in with no injuries goes to the bottom of the list. Firefighters may be responding to fires set by violent protesters and ambulance services may have to respond to a mass shooting or injuries caused by rioting. You, the average citizen may very well be on your own, on your own in the dark in some cases for a very long time, in the winter of our discontent.\\nThe weather will have an influence on you, and it must be dealt with along with the other threats looming. It may be time that you grocery shop for two weeks instead of stopping every night or every other night to grab something quick. This way you stand a good chance of having a week to a 10-day supply of food on hand for emergencies.\\nWe generally recommend several months, and in some cases, several years’ worth of food, but the prepping landscape is changing, and finances are the biggest factor. For most Americans, it is not realistic to have a 6-month supply of food on hand, and with that being the case, you will have to adjust your shopping habits and meal preparation habits, so you do have some food reserves on hand at all times. It may not be much but it may be enough to get past many local disasters. If you can afford to have a 6-month supply on hand do so, but for many this is financially out of reach.\\nThe problem with stockpiling food, however, is that it will need to be prepared and many today simply do not have the time or skills to properly prepare a meal, but during a crisis is not the time to try and learn to cook.\\nThere is more to being prepared than having a spare bedroom filled with dehydrated foods, lanterns, batteries, tents, and sleeping bags. You also need skills, such as cooking, fire starting, how to stay warm outside when the wind chill factor is well below zero and how to prepare fresh foods like wild game or fish, for example, without making the family sick.\\nWe have written dozens of articles about the skills needed, and it is well worth your time to review a few. This article is more about reminding you that regardless of what may be going on in the world, the biggest threat to you is usually local. Snow storms, local power outages, broken water mains, which means no clean water unless you boil it, or you lose a few days of work because of a snowstorm, or you experience icy road conditions and end up in the ditch or down a ravine. Local threats and national and world threats all have to be dealt with, but you start with the most likely at the time.\\nThe Simplest Of Things Matter The Most\\nKeep your vehicle fueled up can save your life. If you run off into the ditch almost on empty, you can’t stay warm. You need a winter survival kit as well. Warm clothing and shoes for walking in snow and wet conditions, blankets and food and water protected from freezing. You don’t have to run out and buy emergency blankets, use one or two from the house and toss a spare jacket in the back and those old snow boots you never wear around the house. The simple things matter.\\nBuy a box of protein bars , and a case of water. For less than 12 bucks, you have water and food for a few days. Toss in some matches, a flashlight, gloves, a small shovel and hat and you are almost there without breaking the bank. You know what you need, it is just a matter of taking the time to do it, and if you look around the house you will find you may not have to run out and buy anything because you already have what you need.\\nYou, of course, have to focus on the big picture as well, the threats from abroad, nuclear war, armed invasions and a major grid collapse but it is likely you will meet a snowstorm or icy roads before the other threats manifest themselves. Of course, we never know for sure, but life is always about the most likely and what is the most realist way of living your life day-to-day.\\nThe post The Winter of Our Discontent: Survival appeared first on Preparing for shtf .\\nSource: prepforshtf.com\"],\n",

       "  ' The True Scandal of 2016 Was The Torture of Chelsea Manning By Jeremy Scahill\\nNovember 10, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" The Intercept \" - A few days ago, we learned that Private Chelsea Manning attempted to take her own life last month for the second time since being sentenced to 35 years at the U.S. military prison in Leavenworth, Kansas. The whistleblower, who provided the collateral murder video, the Iraq and Afghan war logs, and the hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. State Department cables to Wikileaks, was convicted of espionage. As I waited to vote today, I found myself thinking of her languishing in misery in isolation and incarceration.\\nThis election \\x97 particularly in its closing stages \\x97 has been dominated by controversies over emails, classified documents, and Wikileaks. We\\x92ve heard endlessly about Hillary Clinton\\x92s private basement server, her 33,000 deleted emails, the phishing and leaking of John Podesta\\x92s emails, including parts of Clinton\\x92s much discussed private speeches to Goldman Sachs. Trump, for his part, suddenly discovered a great love for Julian Assange, though he does have trouble correctly spelling Wikileaks in his tweets of praise. Taken together with Trump\\x92s bizarre and consistent lauding of Vladimir Putin and leaks from the U.S. intelligence community, the country has been treated to an odd flashback of Cold War propaganda, including a fair dose of red-baiting from the Democrats. In the matter of Anthony Weiner\\x92s computer, his wife Huma Abedin\\x92s communications and the potential implications for Clinton, the FBI, whose overreach had not previously been of much concern to Democrats, suddenly became a deviant manipulator of the electoral process, while Trump and his supporters alternately praised the agency\\x92s professionalism and denounced it as part of the rigged system.\\nThe U.S. public is now getting a taste of the way hacking, phishing, and an overwhelming dependence on fallible machines and networks can impact politics. But let\\x92s be clear: None of the disclosures in this campaign \\x97 not one thing in any of the hacked emails or those declassified and released from Clinton\\x92s private server \\x97 has brought to light anything of greater importance than the documents Chelsea Manning provided to Wikileaks. She revealed war crimes, including murder and torture, dirty and duplicitous dealings of the U.S. and its allies, exposed liars, documented a secret history of America\\x92s longest running war, and forced a much needed debate about the U.S. role in the world. And for that, she is being tortured.\\nThe double standards of our society dictate that a perjurer like the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, faces no consequences for his crimes. Gen. David Petraeus gets a slap on the wrist, no jail time, and prestigious positions at universities for sharing classified information with his mistress. Only Gen. James Cartwright may face the inside of a prison cell for discussing classified information with journalists \\x97 and he is a sacrificial lamb for the cause of exonerating Clinton and Petraeus from any true accountability by the Obama Justice Department.\\nBut Chelsea Manning, whose motivation was noble, whose actions made our country better, faces the full wrath of the system. And it may end up killing her. When we talk about the high-tech scandals that marked this election, at the top of the list should be the torture of Chelsea Manning.'],\n",
       " ['The Failure of US Democracy',\n",
       "  'The Failure of US Democracy How The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump. Most likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this: - is not endeared to the oligarchs. Who are the oligarchs? — Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks’ balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless. — The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power. — The neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China. — The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs. — Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops. — The extractive industries—energy, mining, fracking, and timber—that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply. — The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israell’s way. What convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes’ reporting and the facts on the ground. According to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner. I am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary’s public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida: «Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and sickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages». I know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity. I also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country. This is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote. By controllng the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump. And liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war. That the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NRP presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Repulbican Texas is up for grabs in the election. If this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No «glitches» caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary. The most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. All of my life I have been trying to get Americans of all stripes—academics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners—out of the false reality in which they exist. In the United States today a critical presidential eletion is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. '],\n",

       "  ' The Modern History of \\x91Rigged\\x92 US Elections Donald Trump claims the U.S. presidential election is \\x93rigged,\\x94 drawing condemnation from the political/media establishment which accuses him of undermining faith in American democracy. But neither side understands the real problem, says Robert Parry.\\nBy Robert Parry\\n \" Consortium News \" - The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the world\\x92s \\x93gold standard\\x94 that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The \\x93wise men\\x94 of the system simply insist otherwise.\\nWe have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens\\x92 judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000).\\nStrangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated.\\nThe harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nation\\x92s leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized.\\nOf course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldn\\x92t vote).\\nThat unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners.\\nEven after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century.\\nWomen did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks.\\nIndeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedy\\x92s vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the South\\x92s heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners.\\nHowever, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixon\\x92s Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960.\\nNixon\\x92s \\x91Treason\\x92\\nSo, by 1968, the Democrats\\x92 once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didn\\x92t want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that \\x97 with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided \\x97 President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam.\\nThe documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixon\\x92s campaign went behind Johnson\\x92s back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnson\\x92s Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixon\\x92s emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam.\\nThough Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixon\\x92s \\x93treason\\x94 \\x97 from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election \\x97 he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford \\x96 three pillars of the Establishment \\x96 expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking:\\n\\x93Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that I\\x92m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected,\\x94 Clifford said. \\x93It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our country\\x92s interests.\\x94\\nClifford\\x92s words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of America\\x92s electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process.\\nTo this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixon\\x92s treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the library\\x92s archivists call the file on Nixon\\x92s sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their \\x93X-file.\\x94 [For details, see Consortiumnews.com\\x92s \\x93 LBJ\\x92s \\x91X-File\\x92 on Nixon\\x92s \\x91Treason. \\x92\\x94]\\nThe evidence also strongly suggests that Nixon\\x92s paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his \\x93treason\\x94 \\x96 top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJ\\x92s presidency \\x96 led to Nixon\\x92s creation of the \\x93plumbers,\\x94 a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the \\x93plumbers\\x94 became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee\\x92s headquarters at the Watergate in Washington.\\nAlthough the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixon\\x92s far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnson\\x92s Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixon\\x92s sabotage \\x97 and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome \\x97 the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.com\\x92s \\x93 The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .\\x94]\\nIn effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixon\\x92s strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting president\\x92s foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign.\\nReagan\\x92s \\x91October Surprise\\x92 Caper\\nIn that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagan\\x92s campaign feared that Carter might pull off an \\x93October Surprise\\x94 by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagan\\x92s team take action to block Carter\\x92s October Surprise?\\nThe testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagan\\x92s team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carter\\x92s October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixon\\x92s Paris peace talk maneuver.\\nThat evidence indicates that Reagan\\x92s campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages\\x92 release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagan\\x92s vice presidential running mate.\\nBy early November 1980, the public\\x92s obsession with Iran\\x92s humiliation of the United States and Carter\\x92s inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagan\\x92s inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan.\\nBolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class.\\nBehind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Iran\\x92s cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration.\\nIn summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview:\\n\\x93It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time.\\x94\\nThose early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagan\\x92s beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua\\x92s leftist government.\\nWhile many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there.\\nA half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt.\\nTired of the Story\\nBy the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 \\x93October Surprise\\x94 question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991.\\nHowever, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israel\\x92s exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 \\x93October Surprise\\x94 case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Casey\\x92s attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages.\\nAlthough the bogus Newsweek/New Republic \\x93London alibi\\x94 would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the President\\x92s flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation.\\nMeanwhile, Bush\\x92s State Department and White House counsel\\x92s office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena.\\nYears later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassy\\x92s confirmation of Casey\\x92s trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape.\\nWilliamson said that among the State Department \\x93material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown,\\x94 Beach noted in a \\x93 memorandum for record \\x94 dated Nov. 4, 1991.\\nTwo days later, on Nov. 6, Beach\\x92s boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bush\\x92s reelection hopes in 1992.\\nAt the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bush\\x92s reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to \\x93kill/spike this story.\\x94\\nGray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. \\x93Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate \\x91October Surprise\\x92 investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President ,\\x94 Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.]\\nAmong \\x93touchstones\\x94 cited by Gray were \\x93No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan.\\x94 White House \\x93talking points\\x94 on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings.\\nTimid Democrats\\nBut Bush\\x92s White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received \\x96 and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993 \\x96 there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagan\\x92s election victory.\\nThat would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process \\x96 and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be \\x93good for the country.\\x94\\nIn 2014 when I sent a copy of Beach\\x92s memo regarding Casey\\x92s trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task force\\x92s dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue.\\n\\x93The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip\\x94 to Madrid, Hamilton told me. \\x93Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.\\x94\\nAsked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task force\\x92s dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task force\\x92s investigation.\\n\\x93If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us,\\x94 Hamilton said, adding that \\x93you have to rely on people\\x94 in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquiry\\x92s failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was naďve in the extreme.\\nArguably, Hamilton\\x92s timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bush\\x92s team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamilton\\x92s investigative conclusion reinforced the \\x93group think\\x94 dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a \\x93conspiracy theory\\x94 when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasn\\x92t done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent.\\nStill, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didn\\x92t make any sense .\\nBut the dismissive \\x93group think\\x94 remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned. [For details, see Robert Parry\\x92s America\\x92s Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason: The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnews.com\\x92s \\x93 Second Thoughts on October Surprise. \\x94]\\nPast as Prologue\\nLee Hamilton\\x92s decision to \\x93clear\\x94 Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bush\\x92s rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000.\\nIndeed, if the full truth had been told about the father\\x92s role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, it\\x92s hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush \\x93stolen election\\x94 in 2000.\\nRegarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Florida\\x92s electoral votes and thus the presidency.\\nThe reality of Gore\\x92s rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Florida\\x92s disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted.\\nHowever, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be \\x93good for the country.\\x94\\nSo, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery \\x96 that the so-called \\x93over-votes\\x94 in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices\\x92 names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the \\x93under-votes\\x94 that hadn\\x92t registered on antiquated voting machines. \\x93Over-votes\\x94 would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on \\x93clear intent of the voter.\\x94\\nHowever, instead of leading with Gore\\x92s rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred.\\nOn Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gore\\x92s victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for \\x93the good of the country,\\x94 much as Johnson\\x92s team had done in 1968 regarding Nixon\\x92s sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamilton\\x92s inquiry had done regarding the 1980 \\x93October Surprise\\x94 case.\\nWithin a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didn\\x92t accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom.\\nHowever, this violation of objective and professional journalism \\x96 bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle \\x96 was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future.\\nBy misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000 \\x96 even if the media\\x92s motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks \\x96 the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004.

Gore\\x92s Dark American Decade. \\x94]\\nA Phalanx of Misguided Consensus\\nLooking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the \\x93stolen\\x94 elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful \\x93losers\\x94 are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters\\x92 will had been ignored or twisted.\\nAl Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Court\\x92s majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bush\\x92s \\x93legitimacy.\\x94\\nSimilarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern \\x93wise man,\\x94 in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didn\\x92t ruffle too many feathers.\\nBut the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies \\x96 uttered for \\x93the good of the country\\x94 \\x96 is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest.\\nSo, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isn\\x92t pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia.\\nTrump\\x92s complaints about \\x93rigged\\x94 elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they don\\x92t succeed at \\x93stealing\\x94 the election from white people.\\nThere is a racist undertone to Trump\\x92s version of a \\x93rigged\\x94 democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. He\\x92s just not honest about what those flaws are.\\nThe hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracy\\x92s \\x93gold standard\\x94; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.\\nInvestigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

       " ['The Danger of War From a Declining Hegemon',\n",
       "  'Is a war in the making — a third world war?\\nIf there is much talk about such a possibility, it is mainly because of the tensions between the United States and Russia. Tensions between the two most powerful nuclear states in the world have never been this high since the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991.\\nThere are at least two flash points, one more dangerous than the other. In Eastern Ukraine, Russian backed rebels will not surrender to the US supported regime in Kiev because they see US control over Ukraine as part of a much larger agenda to expand NATO power to the very borders of Russia. This has been happening for some years now.\\nBut it is the Washington-Moscow confrontation in Allepo, Syria which portends to a huge conflagration. The US is protective of major militant groups such as Al-Nusra which has besieged Eastern Allepo and is seeking to overthrow the Bashar al-Assad government. Washington has also set its sight on ‘regime change’ in Damascus ever since the latter’s determined resistance to Israeli occupation of the strategic Golan Heights in Syria from 1967 onwards.\\nThe drive for regime change intensified with the US-Israeli quest for a “new Middle East” following the Anglo-American invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003. It became more pronounced in 2009 when Bashar al-Assad rejected a proposal to allow a gas pipe-line from Qatar to Europe to pass through his country, a pipe-line which would have reduced Europe’s dependence upon Russia for gas. Russia of course has been a long-standing ally of Syria. Together with Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah, it is helping the Syrian government to break the siege of Eastern Allepo and to defeat militants in other parts of Syria.\\nIt is obvious that in both instances, in Ukraine and Syria, the US has not been able to achieve what it wants. The US has also been stymied in Southeast Asia where its attempt to re-assert its power through its 2010 ‘Pivot to Asia’ policy has suffered a serious setback as a result of the decision of the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to pursue an independent foreign policy that no longer adheres blindly to US interests. At the same time, China continues to expand and enhance its economic strength in Asia and the world through its One Belt One Road (OBOR) projects and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and via its leadership of BRICS. China’s regional and global economic role is leading to its pronounced presence in security and military matters. As a result of all this, the US’s imperial power has clearly diminished. It is a hegemon in decline.\\nIt is because it is not prepared to accept its decline that some US generals are threatening to demonstrate US’s military might. If a hegemon is a danger to humankind when it is at its pinnacle, it becomes an even greater threat to peace when its power is diminishing. Like a wounded tiger, it becomes even more furious and ferocious. A new US president may be inclined to give vent to this frustration through an arrogant display of military power.\\nHow can we check such wanton arrogance? There will be elements in the elite stratum of US society itself who would be opposed to the US going to war. We saw a bit of this in 2013 when those who were itching to launch military strikes against Syria based upon dubious “evidence” of the government’s use of chemical weapons were thwarted by others with a saner view of the consequences of war. It is also important to observe that none of the US’s major allies in Europe wants a war. Burdened by severe challenges related to the economy and migration, the governments know that their citizens will reject any move towards war either on the borders of Russia or in Syria and West Asia.\\nThis also suggests that a self-absorbed European citizenry may not have the enthusiasm to mobilise against an imminent war. Let us not forget that it was in European cities from London to Berlin that the biggest demonstrations against the war in Iraq took place in 2003. Anti-war protests will have to be initiated elsewhere this time.\\nGovernments in Moscow and Beijing, in Tehran and Jakarta, in Pretoria and La Paz, should come out openly against war. They should encourage other governments in the Global South and the Global North to denounce any move towards a war that will engulf the whole of humanity. Citizens all over the world should condemn war through a variety of strategies ranging from signature campaigns and letters to the media to public rallies and street demonstrations.\\nIn this campaign against an imminent war, the media, both conventional and alternative, will have a huge role to play. It is unfortunate that well-known media outlets in the West have supported war in the past. It is time that they atone for their sins!\\n '],\n",

For the most part the oldest ‘Anons’ are of the mind that Anonymous should be an exclusive hacker collective – everyone who can’t hack is largely considered a n00b or just a fan of the movement.\\nAnons protesting against the government\\nThe newest members of Anonymous tend to be social justice warriors of sorts; almost none of them are hackers, but they make up the large majority of people who now call themselves “Anonymous.” They are, for the large part, protestors, civil rights/liberties advocates or people who want to change the world, but are unsure on how to go about it. They seem to be drawn to Anonymous, not because all of the hacks occurring around the world, but because they see Anonymous publicly advocating for many of the same things they believe in.\\nThere are a lot of things happening in this world that people do not get to vote on, or simply have no say over; there are a lot of things that tend to control/dictate peoples’ lives, for which they have no control over.\\nI remember a conversation last year with a friend in the movement.

       "  'Given the shameless, over-the-top, almost breathtakingly cloying pro-Hillary promotional hype that Michael Moore has been spouting recently (roughly, since mid-July), the only explanation is that this man—this pride of Flint, Michigan, this modest film documentarian who grew up middle-class but is now worth upwards of $50 million—secretly harbors a desire to play a role in a Hillary Clinton administration.\\nIf not a Cabinet post, then something else. It’s more likely he has his eye on an ambassadorship. Maybe he covets being posted in a fun country, preferably a “resort country,” a country with a temperate climate and friendly people, a country where they speak English and don’t get all carried with civil unrest. The Honorable Michael Francis Moore, U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. You have to admit, it has a nice ring to it.\\nDon’t laugh. How do you think people get these ambassadorships? It’s never been about anything having to do with “qualifications.” Ambassadorships are handed out in return for loyal service, in return for an important political favor, in return for keeping a potential troublemaker quiet, and in return for helping to raise a shit-pot of campaign donations. It’s “quid pro quo” writ large.\\nOf course, when it comes to countries that might actually require a modicum of diplomatic ability, the administration has to be careful. You can’t just take someone off the street and make them ambassador to a place like Russia or China or Brazil, not if the U.S. wishes to maintain its credibility. But still, there are plenty of places in the world where you can pretty much dump anybody.\\nTake President Clinton’s administration, for example. In 1994, Bill Clinton rewarded congresswoman Maxine Waters for her long-time support, along with her role in securing African-American votes, by appointing her husband, Sidney Williams, to the post of U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas. Prior to becoming an ambassador, Williams played football in the NFL, and ran a Cadillac dealership in Los Angeles. Life in Nassau was good.\\nAgain: “Michael Francis Moore: U.S. Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas” has a nice ring to it. If not the Bahamas, then how about Barbados? There’s whole array of places to pick from. Granted, picturing Moore in a silk top hat and coattails instead of his usual baseball cap and sweatshirt is a bit of a stretch, but with a little coaching, there’s no doubt he can pull it off. After all, isn’t that why people in these positions have “personal assistants”?\\nSo best of luck to you, Michael. Let’s hope that when you or your “people” casually mention to Hillary that being an ambassador would be a cool job, she gets the hint. On the other hand, don’t count your chickens before they hatch (to coin a phrase). Because this is big-time politics, there will be a long list of people seeking the same job. Debbie Wasserman and Donna Brazile immediately come to mind.\\n David Macaray is a playwright and author.

       "  'Former United States Department of State official Steve Pieczenik Steve Pieczenik: U.S. Intelligence Waging Coup Against Corrupt Clintons Jon Hall November 1, 2016 \\nRumors and allegations that Bill and Hillary Clinton belong to a high-level pedophile ring have surfaced on the Internet. Without much credence or proof behind the claims, I initially dismissed them. The rumors only persisted and grew and now Steve Pieczenik has now come forward with stunning claims that add fuel to this fire. \\nPieczenik served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger is well-versed in foreign policy, international crisis management, and psychological warfare. He also served under presidential administrations as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush’s White House. In other words Steve Pieczenik — with his proven history of experience — is the real deal. Pieczenik claims that the Clintons and their close associates have successfully pulled off a coup via corruption. \\nHe explains that total corruption and co-option were the two strategies behind this coup. Pieczenik says Bill and Hillary Clinton co-opted many central facets of our government — the White House, the judiciary, the CIA, the FBI. As far as I’m concerned, this idea is well beyond some lunatic conspiracy theory but increasingly likely. \\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch is obviously in the pocket of the Clintons, intervening and obstructing FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton’s private home server and e-mails at every turn. James Comey, who was on the board of directors at HSBC bank, a bank that gave $81 million to the Clinton Foundation, is also the current head of the FBI. Pieczenik goes further to explain that the U.S. Intelligence community has started a counter-coup against the Clintons, providing information to Julian Assange and Wikileaks. \\nWe can finally stop blaming Russians. Pieczenik states clearly that US intelligence offered data to Julian Assange. This counter-coup is working against Hillary Clinton and her campaign and seeks to indict major players in her alleged corrupt scheme. Steve Pieczenik ends the video and tells us “the second American revolution” is happening. \\nPieczenik claims both Clintons are frequent travelers on the Lolita Express — billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane. The Lolita Express flies to Epstein’s private island where the elite duo can ‘have sex with minors’ says Pieczenik. He claims the NYPD has a record of the Clintons and close associates that could potentially implicate them in pedophilia. \\nPieczenik tells that officials will charge Hillary Clinton with multiple crimes including obstruction of justice and other charges. He says that Bill Clinton may also suffer criminal charges. He explains the US Intelligence is aware of Clinton’s shady and illicit misdeeds and that these trips on the Lolita Express were supposedly frequent. The following two tabs change content below.

       "  '\\nPosted by Matthew Bernstein | Nov 17, 2016 | American Strength These Protesters Are Going To Be Charged \\nThe United States is one of the best places to live. You have rights that are given to you from the Constitution, you have the freedom to do what you want (within reason of course), and you have the ability to live in one of the strongest nations in the world. \\nAt least it is supposed to be like that. Unfortunately there are people called liberals that want to completely destroy everything that the Constitution gives you. They want to take away your free speech because it might offend them. They want to take away your ability to have a gun because they don’t like it. And finally they want to make the country into a globalist area. \\nDespite the fact that the United States was founded with the Constitution being the document that gives people power, the liberals have decided that they don’t like that anymore. They are literally doing what they can to destroy any evidence of that. These Two Have Proven That They Don’t Follow The Constitution \\nThe most prominent example would be the fact that after the election was held, in which Donald Trump was the winner, entitled liberals were so angry that they decided they would go out and protest the results. Yes they were protesting the results of a FAIR election, despite the fact that there was still three million illegal votes cast. \\nAnd what do the Democratic leaders have to say about all of this? They have kept their mouths shut on the entire thing. Despite all summer long of having the liberals and their friends in the media saying that Trump needs to talk to his supporters for their “damages” caused, they haven’t done that either. \\nBut it isn’t just the fact that the Democratic leaders are staying silent on the whole issue. There have been numerous reports that these protesters are actually getting paid by George Soros in order to create enough of a disturbance that something would get done. What the liberals want to do is stop the transfer of power. \\nThat way Trump wouldn’t be the person in charge of the entire country. It would still be underneath President Obama. But that is what the liberals want; instead there is a new bill that is coming out that is sure to make liberals everywhere cry. \\nA Republican lawmaker has just come up with the perfect solution to make sure that these protesters stop acting like entitled liberals. The bill in question would allow authorities to charge protesters with committing “economic terrorism.” Washington state Senator Doug Ericksen is the one that is responsible for coming up with the bill. \\n“I respect the right to protest, but when it endangers people’s lives and property, it goes too far. Fear, intimidation, and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression. Those who employ it must be called to account. We are not just going after the people who commit these acts of terrorism. We are going after the people who fund them. Wealthy donors should not feel safe in disrupting middle-class jobs.” People Who Protest Like This Are Going To Get A Rude Wake Up Call \\nThe proposed bill, which is going to pass through considering that the Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, would make protesting a class C felony if they create any sort of “economic disruption” or “jeopardize human life and property.” \\nIt would also mean that people that have been discovered to be in violation of this would face up to five years in prison, or a $10,000 fine, or both. Not only that, but any group that organizes a protest that is considered disruptive would also be charged with “economic terrorism.” \\nThat means that these precious snowflakes that think they can get away with causing damage because they’re upset would have to think twice. But the saddest part about this whole thing is the fact that it was forced to be created. That was because the liberals that were protesting have a difficult time being peaceful. \\nThey honestly think that the best way to go about this whole thing is to make sure that they cause as much damage and destruction as possible. And their defense for it is to say that they have a right to protest. The last time I checked, protesting didn’t involve lighting trashcans on fire or smashing car windshields. That isn’t a protest; that’s a full-blown riot! \\nAnd this is what we have been seeing from the numerous protests that have been going on since the election. There are people doing whatever they can to cause as much damage and destruction as possible. And these people need to learn that they can’t get away with this any longer. \\nOf course the other sad part is that a vast majority of these protesters didn’t even vote in the election. They had a prime opportunity to make sure that their voices were heard and they completely ignored that. And now they decided that they want to have their voice heard by causing as much damage as possible . \\nBut that wasn’t the worst thing that they did. There was a report on CNN that had one of the protesters promising actual DEATH just to make sure that they got what they wanted. Yes these people are so crazy that they want to have people killed just to make sure that they get what they want. It’s people like this that had the bill created in the first place. \\nShare this article with your friends and family to show that people that are going to be protesting and causing damage and mayhem where they go are about to get a rude wake up call. A bill is going to be passed, thanks to an all Republican Congress, which is going to make sure that these protesters face justice for causing destruction. \\nThis is just a way to ensure that we are stronger as a country under Trump. The past eight years have taught children that it is okay to be whiny and complain about everything. That time has past. We no longer have to accept the Band-Aid generation that was seen underneath Obama. This is just the first step into making this country stronger and it is going to continue.

       "  'WOW: Indictment ‘Likely’ in Clinton Foundation Case, Hillary’s Server Hacked by FIVE Foreign Entities By: November 3, 2016 \\nUh-oh. \\nAccording to Bret Baier of Fox News, the FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year, and that investigation has been deep and wide – and just as importantly, the FBI is on the verge of indictment for “pay-for-play” with regard to Hillary’s State Department. The FBI investigation has uncovered laptops from Clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed. \\nAnd most importantly of all , the sources at the FBI have apparently told Baier with “99 percent accuracy” that Hillary’s server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and information was withdrawn. \\nMeanwhile, we now know that the Department of Justice attempted to pressure the FBI into shutting down the investigation into the Clinton Foundation entirely. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI deputy director even asked the DOJ if they truly wanted to shut down a “validly predicated investigation.” \\nThis is devastating information for Hillary. \\nDonald Trump is now leading in Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Iowa, and North Carolina. Trump is within spitting distance in Colorado and Pennsylvania, and two new polls show Trump up in Virginia and New Hampshire, respectively. If Trump picks off any of those latter states, he wins the election. \\nThe best case scenario for Hillary Clinton just days ago was simple: hunker down and wait out these scandals. Assume that as time goes on, the race will revert back to its pre-Comey normal, with Hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead. But each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and State Department. Each new day demonstrates the extent of the cover-up by the Obama administration. \\nHillary’s running out of days to recover. \\nThe only question is whether she can hang on with her fingernails now, especially if the American public is upset enough about her pay-for-play and exposure of American classified material to put Trump in the White House, not trusting Loretta Lynch’s DOJ to prosecute Hillary for her crimes.

       "  ' US Hypocrisy: Bombing of Aleppo is no Worse than what Happened in Gaza and Iraq By Gareth Porter \" MEE \" - The Russian-Syrian bombing campaign in eastern Aleppo, which has ended at least for the time being, has been described in press reports and op-eds as though it were unique in modern military history in its indiscriminateness. In an usual move for a senior US official, Secretary of State John Kerry called for an investigation of war crimes in Aleppo.\\nThe discussion has been lacking in historical context, however. Certainly the civilian death toll from the bombing and shelling in Aleppo has been high, but many of the strikes may not be all that dissimilar from the major US bombing campaign in Iraq in 2003, nor as indiscriminate as Israel\\x92s recent campaigns in densely populated cities.\\nThe impression that the bombing in Aleppo was uniquely indiscriminate was a result of news reporting and commentary suggesting, by implication, that there are no real military targets in east Aleppo.\\nBut in fact, al-Nusra Front turned Aleppo into the central hub of a massive system of conventional warfare in Aleppo province in late January 2016 when it sent an enormous convoy of at least 200 vehicles with troops and weaponry into eastern Aleppo. A dramatic three-minute al-Nusra video shows what appears to be hundreds of vehicles full of troops and trucks with weapons mounted on them.\\nThe Russian command in Syria has drones observing the routes in and out of Aleppo, so it certainly knew where many of those military sites were located. Syrian opposition sources also revealed that Nusra began immediately to put the military assets at its disposal underground, digging deep bunkers to protect troops, military equipment and tunnels through which troops and weapons could be moved unseen.\\nThe move underground explains the Russian use of bunker-buster bombs for the first time in the war. As the Guardian reported , Justin Bronk of the British defence think tank Royal United Service Institute concluded that the Russians \\x93have high-grade intelligence of the whereabouts of Syrian opposition positions,\\x94 mainly because bunker buster bombs are too expensive to use simply to destroy buildings at random.\\nBut like Hamas fighters in Gaza in 2014, the Nusra Front-led command in Aleppo has moved its troops, weapons and command centres around in the tunnels that they have built. So many of the Russian and Syrian air strikes are almost certainly hitting targets that have already been abandoned. And in other cases, the wrong target has undoubtedly been hit.\\nThe Aleppo Health Directorate, a local monitoring group, estimated that 400 civilians had been killed in the first three weeks of bombing in east Aleppo. The United Nations put the death toll at 360 .\\nDrop the superiority act As terrible as that toll of civilian lives is, the United States should drop the stance of moral superiority. When the US military invaded Iraq in 2003, it made no effort to keep track of how many civilians were killed in its bombing and artillery fire, claiming it had no way to tell who was civilian and who was not.\\nAnd the best estimates of civilians killed in US and Israeli urban wars don\\x92t provide any basis for moral superiority. A survey of Baghdad\\x92s hospitals by the Los Angeles Times in May 2003 produced an estimate of at least 1,700 civilians killed in the first five weeks of American war. The estimate included those who had died in ground fighting and from unexploded ordnance, but even with those contributing factors subtracted from the total, it would still be far greater than those killed in the assault on east Aleppo on a weekly basis.\\nThe three-week Israeli war on Gaza City in 2009 and the seven-week war on Gaza in 2014 were also far deadlier than Aleppo. The former killed 773 civilians, according to an investigation by the Israeli human rights organisation B\\x92Tselem. The latter killed 1,473 Palestinian civilians, according to the UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .\\nAttacks on hospitals The one feature of the Russian-Syrian air offensive on east Aleppo that seems most clearly to violate the laws of war is the targeting of hospitals. Media accounts have referred to air strikes with barrel bombs that have hit two major hospitals in the rebel-held part of the city.\\nThe Syrian government has been acting as though it regards the hospitals in eastern Aleppo as serving the Nusra Front command, and the hospitals, which are under intense pressure from the militants who run that part of Aleppo, have fed the government\\x92s suspicions.\\nAs a detailed report by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on the air strikes that hit the Al Quds hospital on 27 April explains, the local organisation that created a new system of hospitals in 2011 decided not to declare the hospitals openly but to keep them \\x93underground\\x94 \\x96 meaning secret from the government.\\nIn fact, of course, the government knows perfectly well where all 10 hospitals in east Aleppo are located. The 27 April air strike that damaged the Al Quds hospital shows how the government has responded. It began with an air strike that destroyed a building across the street from the hospital. The building was a school, but former residents of east Aleppo who have gotten out have confirmed that organisations associated with the al-Qaeda-dominated command have located their offices in schools to try to hide their staff.\\nWithin a few minutes of the initial strike, according to the MSF account, Al Quds hospital staff were pulling survivors out of the rubble and taking them across the street to the emergency room, whereupon the Syrian air force dropped a barrel bomb at the entrance to the emergency room, killing several of the hospital staff, including one doctor. Then it dropped one close enough to the side of the hospital to hit the emergency room and, minutes later, hit a building down the block where hospital staff were staying.\\nSuch attacks on those who try to save the lives of survivors of bombing attacks \\x96 sometimes called \\x93double tap\\x94 attacks\\x94 - are rightly condemned as violations of humanitarian law. And the belief that the staff at the hospital are operating in effect as medics for the adversary\\x92s military does not justify attacking it and the wounded sheltered there.\\nBut such violations of the laws of war are hardly unique to Aleppo or Syria.\\nHardly unique US drone strikes in Pakistan have hit rescuers or mourners after hitting their initial targets in numerous documented cases . In the 2009 Gaza attacks, the Israeli military argued that Hamas fighters were using hospitals to hide from Israeli bombing, but offered no valid evidence to support it, as the Goldstone Report showed .\\nIn 2014, the Israelis completely destroyed the Al-Wafa hospital in an air strike recorded for public release after claiming falsely that it had been fired on by Palestinian gunmen.\\nIn its wars in Gaza and in Lebanon, the IDF has gone well beyond the Russian and Syrian Aleppo campaign in refusing to recognise any distinction between civilian targets. It not only targeted civilian offices in both Gaza wars, but treated entire areas of the city as a legitimate target, on the premise that all civilians had been ordered to leave.\\nAnd in both Gaza and in Beirut suburb of Dahiya , it levelled several high-rise buildings where they believed Hezbollah had offices. The IDF called it the \\x93Dahiya doctrine\\x94, and threatened \\x93great damage and destruction\\x94 on any adversary in any future war in the region.\\nHeavy bombing in a city is inherently fraught with moral risk, and attacks on genuine civilian targets can never be excused. But such practices have been carried out and legitimised in the past by the very government that is now claiming the role of moral and legal arbiter. That hypocrisy needs to be recognised and curbed as well.\\n- Gareth Porter is an independent investigative journalist and winner of the 2012 Gellhorn Prize for journalism.

       " ['An Eight Point Brief for Voting to Avoid Corporate Evil',\n",
       "  '22 Shares\\n1 20 0 1\\nThe anarchist political observer Noam Chomsky has over the years espoused a strategy of voting for the Democrat in swing states. Recently Chomsky, with John Halle, propounded \" An Eight Point Brief for LEV (Lesser Evil Voting) .\"\\nChomsky questions the ethical/moral principle rejecting LEV since lesser evil voting is designed to minimize evil. As futile as lesser evilism is, it is also futile to discuss there being a lesser evilism between the two utterly dominant rightist political parties in the United States. LEV, in fact, is an equally contemptible or greater evil.\\nChomsky, though, sensibly cautions that challenges to the political-business duopoly needs to be contemplated with a full awareness of their possible consequences. What are the possible consequences? Chomsky suggests, \"A Trump presidency, should it materialize, will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the Sanders campaign, particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far right.\" However, another consequence is equally possible: a horrendous slide to the right would spur progressives to coalesce among a leftist Democrat, and/or it might finally cause former or potential Democrats to reject the chicanery of the business-dominated Democrats and embrace the progressivist platform of the Green Party.\\nThis cost/benefit strategic accounting seriously pushes for progressivist change.\\nFocusing on the electoral system, however, must not be the end-all and be-all for bringing about progressivism in the US. Grassroots organizing and activism must continue to inform, oppose poverty and impoverishment, oppose war and violence, and push for human rights and equal opportunity for all people — during electoral periods and between election cycles.\\nMORE... 9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel? - Part 9 9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel? - Part 7 9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel? - Part 3 9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel? - Part 2 I examine Halle and Chomsky\\'s Eight Point Brief for LEV.\\n1) Voting should not be viewed as a form of personal self-expression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values, or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites.\\nNo argument with this.\\n2) The exclusive consequence of the act of voting in 2016 will be (if in a contested \"swing state\") to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning.\\nThis is true of the individual act of voting. The individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral result; that is an obvious given. However, when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of like-minded individuals then enormous potentials emerge. This desire for a change from the effete status quo is, arguably, what occurred with the almost breakthrough candidacy of Bernie Saunders, and it is also what happened, in a dissimilar manner, with the candidacy of Donald Trump. Chomsky has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic action, and it is. But individuals can and do, at times, form a wider consciousness, measurable by statistically rigorous polling results, that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins. An example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the Canadian federal election of 1993. Following two successive majority governments led by the Brian Mulroney Tories, a voting tsunami washed away all but two Tory seats in the 295-seat Parliament. The conservatives had been around since 1867, but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the Tories.\\n3) One of these candidates, Trump, denies the existence of global warming, calls for increasing use of fossil fuels, dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to India and other developing nations as called for in the Paris agreement, the combination of which could, in four years, take us to a catastrophic tipping point. Trump has also pledged to deport 11 million Mexican immigrants, offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted African American protestors at his rallies, stated his \"openness to using nuclear weapons\", supports a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. and regards \"the police in this country as absolutely mistreated and misunderstood\" while having \"done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order.\" Trump has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the rich, hence shredding what remains of the social welfare \"safety net\" despite pretenses.\\nMuch of what Trump stands for is anathema. True. There is no need to defend this man. However, Trump stakes out important positions diametrical to Hillary Clinton; for example, Clinton\\'s advocacy of a no-fly zone over Syria, her saber rattling with Russia, her corporate-friendly policy toward so-called free trade deals.\\nChomsky cleverly anticipated such an objection, writing:\\n... with respect to point 3) which some will challenge by citing the claim that Clinton\\'s foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of Trump.\\nIn any case, while conceding as an outside possibility that Trump\\'s foreign policy is preferable, most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement. Furthermore, insofar as this is the fact of the matter, following the logic through seems to require a vote for Trump, though it\\'s a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it seriously.\\nFirst, Chomsky concedes \"an outside possibility that Trump\\'s foreign policy is preferable...\" In other words, Chomsky posits an inside possibility (one assumes that Chomsky is saying that there is the strongest likelihood) that Clinton\\'s foreign policy is preferable without any substantiation of why this would be so. Second, he raises an unreasonable demand for \"evidence\" that Trump will follow a less menacing foreign policy than Clinton. Given that Trump has never held political office no such evidence exists. What does exist is plenty of evidence that Clinton will pursue a menacing foreign policy. There is no reason to assume Clinton would reduce the number of American military bases overseas or curtail military spending. In fact, it is likelier that she would increase military spending. She will also likeliest resort to a US military attack to bring about \"regime change\" in Syria, pushing the US closer to military confrontation with Russia. Trump\\'s detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to Clinton\\'s rhetoric. But toward Putin or Assad, Clinton\\'s undiplomatic utterances are on record.\\nMoreover, following Chomsky\\'s logic, while the more preferable policies of Trump lack evidence, by the same token, the more objectionable policies of Trump also lack evidence for the same reason: Trump has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the Oval Office. Thus, following this Chomskyian logic one could not pass judgement on hardly of Trump\\'s pronouncements. Would he really build a wall on the Mexico-US border? Where is the evidence for this? Would Trump really ban Muslims from entering the US? Where is the evidence for this?\\nBy effectively undermining Trump\\'s peacemongering vis-à-vis Clinton\\'s warmongering, Chomsky, by the same logic, undermines criticisms of the regressivist political utterances by Trump. Thus, following Chomsky\\'s logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended seriously.\\n4) The suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized and already oppressed populations has a high probability of being significantly greater than that which will result from a Clinton presidency.\\nOne assumes that Chomsky refers to the domestic population here. Trump\\'s policies — if he is true to his word to protect jobs for American workers and punish offshoring of American jobs along with his opposition to the TPP — would be a political reversal for neoliberalization. Clintonomics would be decidedly worse for marginalized and oppressed peoples at home and abroad. The economic plight of students, the poor, and ill, however, would be much better under a Jill Stein presidency .\\nThe economic plight of students, the poor, and ill would be much better under a Jill Stein presidency.\\nIf Chomsky is referring to the preponderant violence of US foreign policy and its oppressive and genocidal on populations, then I agree with his \"basic moral principle\": \"not only must we take responsibility for our actions, but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves.\" Under the Democratic administration hundreds of thousands have died, millions of people have been displaced, and terrorist organizations have proliferated. This is the evidence from Clinton\\'s time in political office. Thus a vote for Clinton is predictably a vote that will lead to a continuation, perhaps even a ramping up, of the suffering of others. Basic morality suggests to this writer to steer clear of casting such an oppression-enabling vote.\\n5) Should constitute sufficient basis to voting for Clinton where a vote is potentially consequential-namely, in a contested, \"swing\" state.\\nI contend that Chomsky\\'s basis for 5) is false or questionable. First, Chomsky has staunchly argued that \"we\" should concentrate foremost on the wrongful actions and crimes of our own state because they are something we can have an influence over. But it seems that Chomsky believes that Trump will supersede Clinton\\'s record of killing in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Clinton is not going to close US military abroad. Trump has called these bases into question. And if one concentrates on the domestic population, at least the rhetoric of Trump against so-called free trade agreements and offshoring US factories abroad bodes well for the American worker.\\n6) However, the left should also recognize that, should Trump win based on its failure to support Clinton, it will repeatedly face the accusation (based in fact), that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a Trump administration.\\nThis criticism is anti-democratic; furthermore, the criticism applies conversely. Chomsky\\'s citing the accusation gives it a veneer of credence. Effectively it leads to the perpetuation of the business-party duopoly. The records of the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations demonstrate the futility of such a proffered rationale. Clinton deregulated the finance sector, exposed American workers to the vagaries of \"free trade,\" implemented regressive welfare policies, and continued aggressive US militarism abroad. Obama? Bailing out the banks; attempts to cut back social security; warring in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and Syria; drone strikes; confrontation with Russia and China; TPP; and the lingering incarceration at Guantanamo Bay. It is important to note that Democrats, arguably, have a freer hand to implement rightist policy than Republicans have since many supporters of Democrats will mute their opposition to avoid providing succor to the Republicans. George Bush was stymied from tinkering with social security. Notably, Obama has done an about-face on social security and proposed an expansion, picking up on the popularity for such a measure from the Bernie Saunders candidacy.\\n7) Often this charge will emanate from establishment operatives who will use it as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the Democratic Party or outside of it. They will ensure that it will be widely circulated in mainstream media channels with the result that many of those who would otherwise be sympathetic to a left challenge will find it a convincing reason to maintain their ties with the political establishment rather than breaking with it, as they must.\\nIt is true that establishment operatives will use LEV as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the Democratic Party or outside of it. That was the case when Ralph Nader ran. It is the case when Cynthia McKinney ran and it is when Jill Stein runs. The corporate media and even many so-called progressives will trot out this time-worn argument with each election cycle. As long as enough people buy into the premise, then the status quo will persist. The result is that a right-wing government always assumes office in Washington. This bodes ill for the poor and working class. It bodes poorly for nation states designated as enemy states by the US.\\n8) Conclusion: by dismissing a \"lesser evil\" electoral logic and thereby increasing the potential for Clinton\\'s defeat the left will undermine what should be at the core of what it claims to be attempting to achieve.\\nConclusion: by buying into a \"lesser evil\" electoral logic the corporate-political duopoly will remain in power to continue policies that primarily benefit the 1% and their goals for further enrichment; to unfetter finance, to pursue a belligerent foreign policy — a policy that seeks to placate the military-industrial establishment; and to further entrench corporate domination of the electoral system. All of this is at cross-hairs with what should be at the core of what progressives claim to be attempting to achieve.\\nFinal Comments\\nThe tragedy of opting for lesser evilism is that the people get evil.\\nSome leftist commentators argue that there is no evilism . I found that to be preposterous. Barack Obama was the so-called lesser evil the previous two election cycles. Obama is not a lesser evilist; he is the man who enables evil. ... The cycles of US-backed violence and killing in places such as Gaza, Syria, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia underscore the utter futility of pandering to a perceived lesser evilism. If one votes for a degree of evil, then one should not be surprised when evil results.\\nProgressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil. Morality dictates that people should not live in fear of being killed. A genuine peacemongering US president is needed to stop the killing and save lives. Consequently, both Democrats and Republicans are anathema. Given the present candidates, if people vote, then the only conscionable vote is for someone not of the business party factions.\\nOnly a propeace \"third\" party will set the US on a new path . Outside of a revolution, the election of a propeace \"third\" party is the only moral direction on the horizon for Americans truly interested in steering their country toward peace and rehabilitating the ensanguined US reputation. Such a \"third party\" vote, however, may well augur the birth of a revolution on many promising fronts.'],\n",

       " ['23 Things to Do to Improve Your Mental Health',\n",
       "  'Prev post Page 1 of 4 Next \\nWhen most people make health resolutions, it usually involves their physical health. Most of us make decisions to exercise more, change our diets, lose weight, and lose body fat, but there are few of us that make resolutions to better our mental health. \\nPreserving your mental health is one of the most important things that you can do to make sure that you are getting the most out of your life. Letting your mental health slide is going to put you under more stress and will limit your ability to enjoy your life and get the most out of your relationships with others. \\nThe good news is, there are some simple habits that you can start using in your life right now to make sure that you are taking care of your mental health, and getting the most out of every day. 1) Set a Sleep Schedule \\nSleep is one of the most important aspects of our overall health, and many experts and doctors cite health as more critical to our overall health and survival than food or water. Though, when we get stressed or life gets busy, sleep is the first thing that we start to put off. \\nWhether stress starts to make it harder for you to go to sleep, or you decide that you can function on less sleep to get more done, eating into your sleep is one of the worst things that you can do for your mental health. Set a strict bedtime and wake up time for yourself. Your body works best when it has a routine for sleeping and waking up in the morning. \\nRead or journal before you go to bed, and see if you can stay away from your phone, laptop, TV, or tablet. Get yourself into the habit of having a habit to wind down at night. 2) Focus on your strengths \\nWith work or in your personal life, it is so easy to be self critical and focus on only your weaknesses. Our culture in working society has ingrained in us over the years to focus on what we are bad at, and get better at it. To strive for being better in all facets of our lives, and to be well rounded. \\nAlways focusing on what you aren’t good at, is not good for your mental health. Take an inventory of your strengths and find ways to use those daily in work and in your personal life. 3) Exercise \\nIt can be so difficult to make time to exercise when you are exhausted with all of your daily responsibilities and obligations. Between work, home, family, friends, and hobbies or downtime, the last thing that you want to worry about is commuting back to your gym to fight over equipment. \\nHere’s the thing though, exercise is something that your body needs. Whether you have been burnt out with working 9-5, being a full time student, or being a full time parent, you need to give your body the movement that it craves. \\nSitting frequently throughout the day can wreck your posture, deplete your energy, and actually make you sad or depressed. You don’t need to exercise for an hour every day to reap the benefits of exercising for your mental health. \\nSee if you can block out just 15-30 minutes per day to exercise. Whether that be taking a run, lifting weights, yoga, or taking a class, the endorphins and health benefits that you get from exercising will help your mental health. 4) Eat well \\nDiet is one of the major keys to mental and physical health. Eating crappy foods, synthetic ingredients, tons of sugar, starches, and fast food can dismantle your mental health in more ways than one. \\nStick to real food that your body recognizes. Focus on eating fruits, vegetables, protein rich foods, and healthy fats that will digest slowly with your body, and serve more of a purpose than just filling you up. 5) Be thankful \\nTake time every day to be thankful and start each day with thankfulness. Keep a notepad or a sheet of paper to track all of the things that you are thankful for every day. 6) Take life a day at a time \\nLeave the worries and stresses of tomorrow for tomorrow, and focus on what you can do today. It is so easy to get stressed out when looking at the next 2-3 years or even the next 2-3 weeks of your life, but taking time to be present in the moments of each day can do a world of good for your mental health.

       "  '2 Shares\\n1 0 0 1\\n(Credit: IoSonoUnaFotoCamera / flickr)\\nWhen the dust settled on the Nov. 8 election, we learned that a completely unpredictable, egomaniacal, narcissistic buffoon would inherit the White House and the vast powers that go along with it. This deeply offended many people who see Donald Trump’s racist and misogynistic rhetoric as “unpresidential.” Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow summed up this view: “I respect the presidency; I do not respect this president-elect.” That the president-elect should not be respected is a given. But why should we respect the presidency?\\nThe Imperial Presidency of the United States has evolved over the last century to the point that the executive holds certain powers that can be considered dictatorial. Arguably, the most consequential decision in politics is to wage war. The Constitution specifically reserves this right for Congress. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, directs the wars that Congress declares. However, starting with Truman’s intervention in the Korean War in 1950 and continuing with invasions of Vietnam, Grenada, Iraq and Afghanistan and the bombings of dozens more countries, the President’s ability to unilaterally initiate war with a sovereign nation has been normalized. Congress has not declared war since 1941 despite the fact the U.S. military has intervened in nearly every corner of the world.\\nIn recent years, George W. Bush assumed the power to kidnap, torture, and assassinate any individual, anywhere in the world, at any time, without even a pretense of due process. Upon replacing Bush, Barack Obama legitimized Bush’s kidnapping and torture (by refusing to prosecute the perpetrators or provide recourse to the victims) while enthusiastically embracing the power to assassinate at will. Noam Chomsky said Obama has trashed the 800-year-old Magna Carta, which King John of England would have approved of.\\nCan there be anything more dictatorial than the power of a single individual to kill and make war at will? While American presidents thankfully do not have the power to unilaterally impose taxes, pass legislation, or incarcerate without charges inside U.S. borders, the illegitimate authority they do possess to carry out unrestrained violence across the world is unquestionably one feature of a dictator.\\nThere has not been a single American president since World War II that has not exceeded his constitutional authority by committing crimes that would meet the standard by which officials were convicted and executed at the Nuremberg trials.\\nRoosevelt’s Executive Order 9066 to imprison Japanese Americans in concentration camps was a flagrant violation of the Fifth Amendment right not to be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\\nMORE...

Reagan oversaw the creation and operation of a terrorist army in Nicaragua, sponsored military dictatorships throughout Central America, and directly invaded Grenada.\\nBush the Elder invaded Panama and Iraq. Clinton oversaw sanctions in Iraq that killed as many as 1 million people, carried out an air war from 15,000 feet against Serbia, and bombed a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that produced medications for half the country. Bush the Lesser invaded and occupied Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama continued both of those wars, as well as dramatically expanding the drone assassination program in as many as seven countries.\\nSo I beg to differ with Blow and anyone else who claims the presidency deserves respect. Any institution or position that permits such illegal and immoral actions unchecked should be eradicated and replaced with some alternative that does not allow such concentration of power in the hands of a single person.\\nLiberal Clinton defender Matt Yglesias argues that from a historical perspective, Trump is uniquely dangerous. “(P)ast presidents,” Yglesias writes, “have simply been restrained by restraint . By a belief that there are certain things one simply cannot try or do.”\\nIt is hard to take such vacuous proclamations with a straight face. As we have seen, every single American president since at least WWII has engaged in serious violations of international and domestic law to cause death, destruction and misery across the world, from murdering individuals without due process to unleashing two nuclear bombs on civilian populations in a defeated country that was seeking to surrender.\\nWhen Trump assumes the presidency, he will inherit a frightening surveillance/military/incarceration apparatus that includes a targeted killing program; a vast NSA domestic and international spying network; a death squad (the Joint Special Operations Command); and an extralegal system for indefinite kidnapping and imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay.\\nPartisans see a problem only when the presidency is in the “wrong” hands. If Obama is at the helm, liberals are fine with unconstitutional mass surveillance or killing an American citizen without charge or trial every now and then. Conservatives trusted Bush to warrantlessly surveill Americans, but were outraged at the Snowden revelations.\\nPrincipled opponents recognize that no one should be trusted with illegitimate authority. The hand-wringing and hyperventilation by liberals about the dangers of a Trump presidency ring hollow and hypocritical.\\nAmerican presidents long ago became the equivalent of elected monarchs, beyond the democratic control of the those they purportedly serve. The occupant of the office is able to substitute his own judgments and whims for a universally applicable set of laws and limits on the exercise of power. It is what Dolores Vek describes as “actually existing fascism.” Both parties have contributed to it, the media has normalized it, and the public has accepted its creation and continued existence without rebelling against it. It’s time to stop treating the presidency itself with respect and start actively delegitimizing it.'],\n",
       " [\"5 Trump Advisors Who Prove He's More Like Hillary Clinton Than Thought\",\n",
       "  \"Pin \\n( ANTIMEDIA ) Before the presidential election, some Americans expressed hope that Donald Trump, if elected, would scale back U.S. militarism and the federal government’s habit of instigating and supporting regime change abroad. This hope came despite Trump’s promise to expand the scope of the American military. \\nOn the campaign trail, Trump criticized the Iraq war and nation-building. Since his election, he has garnered positive feedback from Russia, signaling cooling of tensions between the two large powers and highlighting a stark difference between Trump and his competitor, Hillary Clinton. But the president-elect’s impending choices for his cabinet and advisers should raise alarm for anyone interested in diminishing the U.S. military’s presence around the world. \\nHere are five figures who shatter the perception that Donald Trump will be a “peace” president: \\n1. Vice President-elect Mike Pence – Much of the nation is reeling over Pence’s regressive views on homosexuality and abortion, but one of his most damning stances is his support for traditional neoconservative foreign policy. When he was a House representative, Pence voted in favor of George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq — the same one Trump has criticized. Pence has indicated the same type of hawkishness in his stance on Syria, which also contradicts Trump’s. \\n“ If Russia…continues to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime ,” Pence said during one of the vice presidential debates this election cycle. Interestingly, his rhetoric sounds much like that of Hillary Clinton , who drew the support of many pro-war Republicans this year. \\nWith Joe Biden as his predecessor, it’s easy to assume Pence will have little tangible power, especially under a colossal personality like Trump. That being said, he recently said he views Dick Cheney as his role model. Cheney, one of the key architects and profiteers of the Iraq war, was largely believed to pull the strings of the Bush presidency. As President Obama previously joked : \\n“ A few weeks ago Dick Cheney said he thinks I’m the worst president of his lifetime, which is interesting, because I think Dick Cheney is the worst president of my lifetime .” \\n2. Rudy Giuliani — Rudy Giuliani is on Trump’s presidential transition team, and earlier this week he was he rumored to be up for the role of secretary of state. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Giuliani, who enthusiastically backed Trump’s campaign, is vying for the role of top diplomat and that Trump is inclined to reward his loyalty. Sign up for the free Anti-Media newsletter the establishment doesn't want you to receive \\nGiuliani, who was mayor of New York City during the 9/11 attacks in 2001, has long espoused hawkish policy in favor of security, often referencing the historic attacks as justification for his views. \\nHis lack of regard for rule of law is apparent in his recent statement that “anything’s legal” in war. He is apparently unaware of the Geneva Conventions . Giuliani was also a staunch proponent of the Iraq War and, unfortunately, fails to see the consequences of perpetual overseas intervention. \\nRon Paul attempted to explain these consequences during a 2008 presidential debate when both he and Giuliani were running for president. \\n“ We need to look at what we do from the perspective of what would happen if somebody else did it to us ,” Paul urged, attempting to explain that the United States’ ongoing bombing of the Middle East sows resentment and inspires terror attacks. \\nGiuliani ultimately insisted on adding to the conversation and was quick to invoke fear mongering and emotion surrounding 9/11: \\n“ That’s really an extraordinary statement. That’s an extraordinary statement, as someone who lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don’t think I’ve heard that before, and I’ve heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn’t really mean that .” \\nPaul did not retract that comment and rather, went on to explain the CIA’s concept of blowback and the United States’ meddling in Iran in 1953. \\nEight years later at the Republican national convention, Giuliani appeared to have ignored Paul’s warning, choosing instead to focus on the dangers of Islamic extremism without addressing the root causes but inserting plenty of 9/11 references. He promised terrorists that America is “coming for you.” \\nConsidering Hillary Clinton was able to leverage a war in Libya , weapons sales to regimes that donated to her foundation, and the failed policy of arming radical Syrian rebels in their fight against Assad, a Giuliani State Department could have violent ramifications. \\n3. John Bolton – Trump’s other potential secretary of state also adheres to establishment Republican party foreign policy. Bolton served as George W. Bush’s undersecretary, and in 2002, made wildly inaccurate claims about the impending Iraq war. As noted by the Atlantic : \\n“ Bolton was both a booster, and a minor architect, of the war in Iraq. As George W. Bush’s undersecretary of state in late 2002, he told the BBC that ‘We are confident that Saddam Hussein has hidden weapons of mass destruction and production facilities in Iraq.’ He added that ‘the Iraqi people would be unique in history if they didn’t welcome the overthrow of this dictatorial regime,’ and that although building a democracy would prove a ‘difficult task,’ the people of Iraq ‘are fully competent to do it.’ So competent, in fact, that ‘the American role [in post-war Iraq] actually will be fairly minimal.’ ” \\nAs Senator Rand Paul detailed in an op-ed explaining why he will oppose a Bolton appointment should it come to pass: \\n“ Bolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years — particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president. \\n“ John Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised .” \\nBolton recently advocated war with Iran and is a member of the Council on Foreign relations, a foreign policy think tank. Dick Cheney is a member of the council and Hillary Clinton has lauded it for its leadership, which is guided by a litany of corporations , including Lockheed Martin, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase & Co., and Exxon Mobil Corporation. \\nAs Paul also noted, Bolton shares many policy aims with Clinton: \\n“ In 2011, Bolton bashed Obama ‘for his refusal to directly target Gaddafi’ and declared, ‘there is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi… But Obama missed it.’ In fact, Obama actually took Bolton’s advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged , ‘We came, we saw, he died .’” \\nA Bolton State Department is, like a hypothetical Giuliani one, a recipe for continued aggression and reckless foreign policy. \\n4. James Woolsey – Few things scream “establishment” louder than appointing a former CIA director and key member of the Project for a New American Century (PNAC) to serve as a senior national security adviser. \\nPNAC was a pro-war think tank made up of prominent neoconservatives. It has since been disbanded, but archived versions of their website reveal the organization’s foundationally militaristic objectives). Woolsey has carried their torch. \\nAccording to the Intercept , Woolsey was a key supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq long before it transpired: \\n“ Woolsey signed a letter in 1998 calling on Clinton to depose Saddam Hussein and only hours after the 9/11 attacks appeared on CNN and blamed the attacks on Iraq. Woolsey has continued to insist on such a connection despite the complete lack of evidence to support his argument. He also blames Iran. ” \\nThe Intercept added: \\n“ He chairs the leadership council at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a hawkish national security nonprofit, and is a venture partner with Lux Capital Management, which invests in emerging technologies like drones , satellite imaging, and artificial intelligence. ” \\nInterestingly, Woolsey also served as Vice President of Booz Allen Hamilton, the firm where whistleblower Edward Snowden worked before exposing the NSA’s secret surveillance programs. \\nWoolsey has said Snowden should be “ hanged by the neck until he’s dead, rather than merely electrocuted. ” \\nSo there’s that. \\n5. General Mike Flynn – Some have expressed optimism that Donald Trump included General Mike Flynn on his transition team and as a potential member of his administration. Flynn deviates from other militaristic members of Trump’s new team in that he’s willing to acknowledge the Iraq war was a mistake and has criticized Obama’s drone wars. Flynn played an active role in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. \\nAs he said last year: \\n“ When 9/11 occurred, all the emotions took over, and our response was, ‘Where did those bastards come from? Let’s go kill them. Let’s go get them.’ Instead of asking why they attacked us, we asked where they came from. Then we strategically marched in the wrong direction. ” \\nEven so, Flynn has criticized the Iran deal, and as the Intercept noted: \\n“ What Flynn appears to view as speaking honestly has a tendency to veer into dangerous and Islamophobic terrain. Earlier this year, he called for the destruction of Raqqa, the Syrian city captured by the Islamic State where tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped .” \\nFlynn has condemned elements of war, but his military mindset prevails. As the Intercept also observed: \\n“ Militarily, the campaign Flynn envisions would be ‘similar to the effort during World War II or the Cold War’ and would be guided by a single leader answering to the president. ” \\nFlynn may have issues gaining a key role in a Trump administration because of his previous role as Director of Intelligence for the Pentagon (he was ousted in 2014), as well as his consulting firm’s ties to a close ally of Turkish President Recep Erdogan, who has imposed authoritarian policies in Turkey. \\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , Trump also recently added Frank Gaffney — a longtime hawk with a penchant for condemning Islam — to his transition team. The Trump campaign asserts he is not officially a member and is simply offering advice. \\nThough some may point to Trump’s potential partnership with Vladimir Putin as hope that some international conflicts may be resolved, Trump has willfully chosen to surround himself with establishment figures who contradict the foreign policy points he seemed to espouse — namely, the failures of regime change and the Iraq War. In fact, these individuals actually lean toward Hillary Clinton’s hawkish foreign policy agenda. \\nUnfortunately, Trump’s campaign promises to “bomb the hell” out of ISIS belie a chronically establishment foreign policy outlook — one sure to produce more terrorists in the indefinite, nebulous war against an ideology continually catalyzed by aggressive American militarism. \\nThis article ( 5 Trump Advisors Who Prove He’s More Like Hillary Clinton Than You Thought ) is free and open source.

       " ['Why Palestinians Want to Sue Britain: 99 Years since the Balfour Declaration',\n",
       "  \"9 Shares\\n8 0 0 1\\nLast July, the Palestinian Authority took the unexpected, although belated step of seeking Arab backing in suing Britain over the Balfour Declaration. That ‘declaration’ was the first ever explicit commitment made by Britain, and the West in general, to establish a Jewish homeland atop an existing Palestinian homeland.\\nIt is too early to tell whether the Arab League would heed the Palestinian call , or if the PA would even follow through, especially considering that the latter has the habit of making too many proclamations backed by little or no action.\\nHowever, it seems that the next year will witness a significant tug of war regarding the Balfour Declaration, the 100th anniversary of which will be commemorated on November 02, 2017 .\\nBut who is Balfour, what is the Balfour Declaration and why does all of this matters today?\\nBritain's Foreign Secretary from late 1916, Arthur James Balfour, had pledged Palestine to another people. That promise was made on November 02, 1917 on behalf of the British government in the form of a letter sent to the leader of the Jewish community in Britain, Walter Rothschild.\\nMORE... Palestine’s reality: Al Nakba commemoration and the right of return or the return of the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement? To be a child in Palestine, where Israel has killed more children than the total number of goals scored in all FIFA World Cups Let There Be Water: Israel's policy of stolen water No hope and no heroes for Palestine At the time, Britain was not even in control of Palestine, which was still part of the Ottoman Empire. Either way, Palestine was never Balfour’s to so casually transfer to anyone else. His letter read:\\n“His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”\\nHe concluded, “I should be grateful if you would bring this declaration to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.”\\nBalfour was hardly acting on his own. True, the Declaration bears his name, yet, in reality, he was a loyal agent of an Empire with massive geopolitical designs, not only concerning Palestine alone, but with Palestine as part of a larger Arab landscape.\\nOnly a year earlier, another sinister document was introduced, albeit secretly. It was endorsed by another top British diplomat, Mark Sykes and, on behalf of France, by François Georges-Picot. The Russians were informed of the agreement, as they too had received a piece of the Ottoman cake.\\nThe document indicated that, once the Ottomans were soundly defeated, their territories, including Palestine, would be split among the prospective victorious parties.\\nThe Sykes-Picot Agreement , also known as the ‘Asia Minor Agreement’, was signed in secret one hundred years ago, two years into World War I. It signified the brutal nature of colonial powers that rarely associated land and resources with people who lived upon or owned them.\\nThe centerpiece of the agreement was a map that was marked with straight lines by a China graph pencil. The map largely determined the fate of the Arabs, dividing them in accordance with various haphazard assumptions of tribal and sectarian lines.\\nThe improvised map consisted not only of lines but also colors , along with language that attested to the fact that the two countries viewed the Arab region purely on materialistic terms, without paying the slightest attention to the possible repercussions of slicing up entire civilizations with a multifarious history of co-operation and conflict.\\nThe Sykes-Picot negotiations were completed in March 1916 and, although official, was secretly signed on May 19, 1916.\\nWWI concluded on November 11, 1918, after which the division of the Ottoman Empire began in earnest.\\nBritish and French mandates were extended over divided Arab entities, while Palestine was granted to the Zionist movement a year later, when Belfour conveyed the British government’s promise, sealing the fate of Palestinians to a life of perpetual war and turmoil.\\nRarely was British-Western hypocrisy and complete disregard for the national aspiration of any other nation on full display as in the case of Palestine. Beginning with the first wave of Zionist Jewish migration to Palestine in 1882, European countries helped facilitate the movement of illegal settlers and resources, where the establishment of many colonies, large and small, was afoot.\\nSo when Balfour sent his letter to Rothschild, the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was very much plausible.\\nStill, many supercilious promises were being made to the Arabs during the Great War years, as the Arab leadership sided with the British in their war against the Ottoman Empire. Arabs were promised instant independence, including that of the Palestinians.\\nWhen the intentions of the British and their rapport with the Zionists became too apparent, Palestinians rebelled , marking a rebellion that has never ceased 99 years later, and highlighting the horrific consequences of British colonialism and the eventual complete Zionist takeover of Palestine which is still felt after all of these years.\\nPaltry attempts to pacify Palestinian anger were to no avail, especially after the League of Nations Council in July 1922 approved the terms of the British Mandate over Palestine – which was originally granted to Britain in April 1920 – without consulting the Palestinians at all. In fact, Palestinians would disappear from the British and international radar, only to reappear as negligible rioters, troublemakers, and obstacles to the joint British-Zionist colonial concoctions.\\nDespite occasional assurances to the contrary, the British intention of ensuring the establishment of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine was becoming clearer with time. The Balfour Declaration was not merely an aberration, but had, indeed, set the stage for the full-scale ethnic cleansing that followed, three decades later.\\nIn fact, that history remains in constant replay: the Zionists claimed Palestine and renamed it ‘Israel’; the British continue to support them, although never ceasing to pay lip-service to the Arabs; and the Palestinian people remain a nation that is geographically fragmented between refugee camps, in the diaspora, militarily occupied, or treated as second class citizens in a country upon which their ancestors dwelt since time immemorial.\\nWhile Balfour cannot be blamed for all the misfortunates that have befallen Palestinians since he communicated his brief, but infamous letter, the notion that his ‘promise’ embodied - that of complete disregard of the aspirations and rights of the Palestinian Arab people – that very letter is handed from one generation of British diplomats to the next, in the same way that Palestinian resistance to colonialism has and continues to spread across generations.\\nThat injustice continues, thus the perpetuation of the conflict. What the British, the early Zionists, the Americans and subsequent Israeli governments failed to understand, and continue to ignore at their own peril, is that there can be no peace without justice and equality in Palestine; and that Palestinians will continue to resist, as long as the reasons that inspired their rebellion nearly a century ago, remain in place.\"],\n",

The rulers of this new society will be the people who effectively control the means of production.”\\n“The real question,” Orwell adds, “is not whether the people who wipe their boots on us during the next fifty years are to be called managers, bureaucrats, or politicians: the question is whether capitalism, now obviously doomed, is to give way to oligarchy or to true democracy.”\\nWhile Orwell was wary of Burnham’s worldview and of his more specific predictions, he agreed that the relationship between capitalism and democracy has always been, and always will be, a precarious one.\\n“For quite fifty years past,” Orwell noted, “the general drift has almost certainly been towards oligarchy.”\\nPointing to the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of the few and acknowledging “the weakness of the proletariat against the centralised state,” Orwell was far from optimistic about the future — but he was quite certain that the economic status quo would eventually give way.\\nRecent events, and the material circumstances of much of the world’s population, have prompted serious examinations of the same questions Orwell was considering seven decades ago. And though it appears as if rumors of capitalism’s imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated, there is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent (self-induced) shocks has reached a breaking point.\\nWidespread discontent over stagnant incomes and the uneven prosperity brought about by neoliberal globalization has, in 2016, come to a head in striking fashion; Donald Trump, Brexit, and the rise of far-right parties in Europe have many questioning previously sacred assumptions.\\n“Is the marriage between liberal democracy and global capitalism an enduring one?” asked Martin Wolf, a formidable commentator in one of the world’s leading business papers, the Financial Times .\\nThis was no rhetorical softball; Wolf is genuinely concerned that the winners of globalization have grown complacent, that they have “taken for granted” a couple that was only tenuously compatible to begin with. He also worries, rightly, that they have downplayed the concerns of the “losers.”\\nWolf concludes that “if the legitimacy of our democratic political systems is to be maintained, economic policy must be orientated towards promoting the interests of the many not the few; in the first place would be the citizenry, to whom the politicians are accountable.”\\nNot all members of the commentariat share Wolf’s willingness to engage with these cherished assumptions, however. Indeed, many analysts have reserved their ire not for failing institutions or policies but for the public, reviving Walter Lippmann’s characterization of the masses as a “bewildered herd” that, if left to its own devices, is sure to usher in a regime of chaos.\\n“It’s time,” declared Foreign Policy ‘s James Traub, channeling the sentiments of Josh Barro, “for the elites to rise up against the ignorant masses.”\\nApologists like Traub and Barro — just two among many — speak and write as if the leash previously restraining the “herd” has been loosened, and that the resulting freedom has laid bare what elitists have long believed to be the case: To use Barro’s infamous words , “Elites are usually elite for good reason, and tend to have better judgment than the average person.” They point to the rise of Donald Trump as evidence of an intolerable democratic surplus — evidence, in short, of what the masses will do if granted a loud enough voice.\\nAside from being conveniently self-serving, this narrative is also false.\\nFar from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions. The resulting concentration of wealth and political power is jarring, and it puts the lie to the farcical notion that elites are a persecuted minority.\\nBut, in the midst of these anti-democratic diatribes, fascinating and important critiques of a rather different nature have emerged.\\n“Far from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions.”\\nInstead of urging us to align Against Democracy , to use the name of a recent book by the libertarian political philosopher Jason Brennan, many are arguing that it is capitalism, and not the excesses of the democratic process, that has provided figures like Trump a launching pad.\\nIn his book Postcapitalism , Paul Mason argues that the rapid emergence of information technology has corroded the boundaries of the market; “capitalism,” he insists, “has reached the limits of its capacity to adapt.” And its attempts to reach beyond these limits have fostered an economic environment defined by instability, crippling austerity for the many, and rapid accumulation of wealth for the few.\\nAccording to Oxfam, the global 1 percent now owns as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent. CEO pay has continued to soar. And though post-crisis reforms have carried soaring promises of stability, the financial sector is still far too large , and many of the banks harmed by the crash they created are back and nearly as powerful as ever .'],\n",

       "  'George Orwell 0 Comment \\nYesterday’s bombshell from the FBI on Hillary’s campaign seems like is much worse than previously expected. \\nJames Comey said that the FBI discovered “new emails” pertinent to the previous investigation on “several devices.” The agency has found a staggering number of emails, and they were found on Huma Abedin’s estranged husband’s laptop. \\nVIA America’s Freedom Fighters \\n\\nThat’s not even the worst part. It was previously discovered that Abedin had been archiving her email account from her work at the State Department on her personal email account, although the reason why is unclear. \\nMore from Zero Hedge: \\n\\nWe first laid what was the most likely explanation yesterday, when we showed several examples of Huma Abedin emails being sent from her work email account to her personal account at humaabedin@yahoo.com, courtesy of a Judicial Watch FOIA release. Of the more than 160 emails in the latest Judicial Watch release, some 110 emails – two-thirds of the total – were forwarded by Abedin to two personal addresses she controlled. The Washington Times reported in August 2015 that the State Department had admitted to a federal judge that Abedin and Mills used personal email accounts to conduct government business in addition to Clinton’s private clintonemail.com to transact State Department business. \\n\\nOne email from May 15, 2009, was sent by Abedin from her State Department email to her personal email. Abedin was archiving in her personal email account an email Hillary Clinton sent her from Clinton’s private email server at HDR22@clintonemail.com. Abedin was asked to print out attachments to an email Mills sent via a private address the previous day to Clinton involving “timetables and deliverables” for her review via Alec Ross, a technology policy expert who then held the title of senior adviser for innovation to Secretary Clinton. \\n\\nHowever, while forwarding Hillary’s emails to her personal email server for “convenience” is one thing, what is more troubling is the amount of redaction involved in these emails which migrated to the open email account, which as we now know ended up in Anthony Weiner’s computer: in the above example, the two pages of timetables and deliverables attached to the email were 100 percent redacted, with “PAGE DENIED” stamped across the first redacted page. \\n\\nAt this point it’s impossible to know why Abedin did what she did; however, the fact that FBI reopened this case this close to the election let’s us know there’s something seriously, seriously wrong with this entire ordeal. \\nThis is more proof that she is CROOKED, and should be tried for treason! \\n'],\n",

       "  '64 SHARE President Obama has signed an Executive Order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on December 19th. (AP Photo / Dennis System) \\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — Following the results of Tuesday night’s election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. \\n“People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,” Obama told reporters. “Many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.” \\nUnder the President’s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday’s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. \\nNot surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president’s decision. \\n“Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn’t allow that to happen. President Obama doesn’t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.” \\nThe president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. \\n“We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.” \\nPaul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. \\n“Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states’ electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.” \\nPolitical Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President’s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. \\n“[The electoral college] is a f—king joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and that’s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It’s time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.” \\nObama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. \\n“We’re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,” Obama said. “Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn’t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?” Obama said. “If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.” \\nIf you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administration’s special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

Knowing this was a fairly urgent matter, she waited 20 minutes and paged the doctor again. And after another 20 minutes, a third time. \\nFrustrated and concerned, she picked up the phone and called the resident knowing she would be very annoyed at best. But the doctor was not available by phone either. After some astute investigating, Betty Sue eventually found Dr. Jen Willis sleeping in the call room covered in Cheerios and saliva. \\nGiven the grave nature of the problem, Betty touched base with the resident’s attending who ultimately corrected the faulty order. “Another brilliant batch of new doctors,” grumbled Attending Dr. Bill Wineberg. \\nThe patient is now doing well after receiving the appropriate amount of potassium to correct her cardiac arrhythmia. “Doctors are so brilliant,” the patient stated, “I feel great!” \\nNurse Betty Sue was later interviewed by the hospital’s Sentinel Event committee regarding the near miss error.

He stared back at her and declared that he had a duty to Congress and the American people to let them know what is REALLY going on. Comey said, “I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” So thank you, FBI Director Comey, for finally growing a pair and standing up to the Hillary Clinton and Obama machine.

       "  'By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com\\nIn a country continuing to shirk the ordinary, Iceland’s Pirate Party — an amalgamation of anarchists, libertarians, and hackers, who want to ban digital surveillance — is predicted to win the country’s national elections this Saturday.\\nThis collection of free-thinkers have upturned the traditional Western political paradigm and hopes to use online public polls to shape governmental policy and end all Internet spying.\\nAlthough the Pirate Party formed just four years ago, its popularity has skyrocketed — most likely for unconventional tactics aligning loosely with libertarianism — the promotion of privacy rights and personal freedoms, and simultaneous shrinking of Big Government.\\nEdward Snowden has been offered the safe haven of Icelandic citizenship should the Pirates likely victory come to fruition — which makes sense, given the party’s anti-establishment roots.\\nIn fact, the Pirates have experienced astonishing success in a short time — taking the nation’s longstanding political traditionalists off-guard in the process — even the group’s founder, a programmer and former Wikileaks activist, is stunned.\\nAsked whether she expected the explosion of enthusiasm for the nascent Pirate Party — which now leads in public polls with 22.6 percent — founder Birgitta Jónsdóttir decisively told the Washington Post , “No way.”\\nBut considering growing frustration with ever-increasing Western governments — and all of the surveillance programs, police state tactics, and chill on personal liberties — the rise of the Pirates, who describe themselves as neither right nor left but a radical mix of both, hardly seems too shocking.\\n“People want real changes and they understand that we have to change the systems,” Jónsdóttir asserted, “we have to modernize how we make laws.”\\nAccording to the Pirates’ website , “The Icelandic Pirate Party was founded on November 24th, 2012 based on the political ideology of the Swedish Pirate Party, which Richard Falkvinge founded in January 2006, to bring about internet copyright reform.”'],\n",

Islam\\n Publisher: New York: Nova Science Publishers\\n ISBN 978-1-63485-542-6.\\n At a time of politics of fear, Jaan Islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece, True Islam, Jihad and Terrorism (Nova Science Publishers, New York, 2016). During the 2016 US election, it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of Islam and how it is understood in today’s context. This is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about Islamic history, philosophy, and political science. This book presents the Islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great Muslim thinkers and scholars such as Ibn Khaldun. Jaan Islam uses the so-called ‘Islamic cognition technique’ and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to Islamic cognition. This chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields. Such an extension was first pointed by Islam, Zatzman and Islam (2013) in their ground-breaking work on educational curriculum.\\nMORE... Stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of Modern Imperialism Another Ramadan for Muslims amid sufferings A conversation on equality, integration and Islam as a religious marker An open letter to young Muslims everywhere: The seed of triumph in every adversity Following the tradition of early Islamic scholars, Jaan Islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary Islamic sources, Qur'an and authenticated traditions of the prophet . These sources were completely ignored in the in the Orientalist (now it has morphed into neo-Orientalism) writings, which led to the inundation of the post 9/11 world with disinformation and agenda-driven ‘research’ about Islamic history. The distinction between this book and these agenda-driven ones gives the book a special value.\\n Although the book explains the Islamic foundations of political science and governance, it should not be looked at as a book of theology. It is a dogma-free approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere . Quite appropriately, the author starts off with a brilliant narration of Islamic cognition. It has been all but forgotten in the west that Islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogma-free, truly scientific cognition. The west does recognize Averröes, the famous Islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy, whereas brands Islam as just another religion, similar to Christianity, infected with doctrinal philosophy. It is no surprise that with that starting point, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west.\\nChapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers, namely Hobbes, Locke and Ibn Khaldun. In this chapter, the author debunks another myth, that is Ibn Khaldun’s political theory is somehow similar to those of Hobbes and Locke. Ibn Khaldun, the father of social science, indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition. The author points out how Ibn Khaldun’s first premise was Shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using Qur’an as the origin and prophet Muhammad’s life (through the book of Hadith) as the pivotal point. One the other hand, Locke had placed himself as the pivotal point, whereas Hobbes eliminated any cognition point. The author makes it clear that both Hobbes’ and Locke’s cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition. In my researched opinion, this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic. It is because the eastern authors do not know about Hobbes and Locke and the western authors do not know about Islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with Ibn Khaldun.\\nIn Chapter 4, the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs (known as Rashedun Caliphs). Clearly, the author’s intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the Qur’an they were enacting. For the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly, the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the Qur’an. No other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in. This finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young Islamic state of the time.\\nSimilar to Chapter 4, the author discovers jus ad bello in Islamic jurisprudence in Chapter 5. Once again, the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner, one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not. The theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter.\\nIn Chapter 6, the author addresses a difficult topic. When is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state? It is often stated that Islam is a complete code of life. The author makes it clear that Islam didn’t leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time. The important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary. This is not an easy topic to cover even in today’s world. The author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary. The history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided Caliphate, the victors were no longer rightly guided. The author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership. This chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of Islam that has spent lifetime on the topic.\\nOften when Islamic criteria are discussed, eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief. If it is all that simple, why don’t Islamic scholars have consensus? The author handles this topic like a pro. In Chapter 7, he analyzes current Islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process. He has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the self-righteous, apologist ‘scholars’ that have done great disservice to Islam and/or scientific cognition process. One doesn’t have to be personal, but the writing is so clear, one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars. To anyone’s surprise, this list is not made out of anti-Islamic non-Muslim scholars.\\nChapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears. The author analyzes every major event of today’s political arena and analyzes it with the Islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum. The author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups. Most interesting is the discussion on current US allies, such as Saudi Arabia, and how they rank among the biggest offenders of Islam and Islamic laws. This is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable, punctuated with numerous riveting arguments.\\nChapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation. I have studied Islam for some 30 years and yet I found these conclusions novel and entirely logical. I doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion. It is important to read the book in sequence.\\nChapter 10 lists the bibliography and references. It is many pages long and is quite comprehensive.\\nChapter 11 is the Appendix that lists the letters of the prophet. It is a great idea to give the letters in original Arabic, so there is no room for misinterpretation, let alone disinformation.\\nAnyone with knowledge of Islam knows that Jihad is in the core of Islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology. Quite interestingly, the author even depicts Jihad as the roof of Islam. Without the roof, the Fort of Islam has no protection whatsoever. This depiction captures the essence of protection, security, as well as integrity and puts away the notion of Jihad being a weapon for Crusade like aggression.\\nThis book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about Islam or what Islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word, Islam that means peace through submission to the creator. This book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in today’s world. In this sense, this book is a manual for world governance in peace.\"],\n",
       " ['Tesla Earnings Smash Expectations After Dramatic Change In Reporting Methodology | Zero Hedge',\n",
       "  'Oct 26, 2016 4:26 PM 0 SHARES \\nThere was a sudden burst of confusion heading into today\\'s Tesla earnings. As Bloomberg reported , a change in the way Tesla Motors Inc. will report quarterly results after today’s market close has created a bit of a last-minute headache for analysts, with earnings estimates varying widely. The electric-car maker is phasing out most of the non-GAAP adjustments it’s traditionally made, including ones for resale value guarantees or vehicles leased through banking partners. Starting today, when the company discusses third-quarter adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share, it plans to exclude only stock-based compensation. \\nThe SEC in recent months has raised concern that public companies may be straying too far too often from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Though Tesla has telegraphed its plan for weeks, many analysts are only now revising forecast models and some are sitting out the guessing game entirely this time. That means it may be challenging to draw firm conclusions about whether Tesla missed or beat Wall Street expectations - giving added importance to what Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says on a follow-up conference call about cash or production plans. \\nSo heading into today\\'s earnings, the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts stands at an adjusted loss of 54 cents a share, based on seven forecasts that have comparable methodologies that the firms say take the new practice into account. While all seven of those projected a loss, there are others who say the company may post a profit. \\nWell, those who expected a profit got just that, because momnets ago Tesla not only reported revenue of $2.3 billion, far higher than the $1.9 billion expected, but also reported its first quarterly profit of $74 cents, smashing consensus estimate of a 54 cent loss. \\nSince there will be much confusion over how these numbers make any sense, here is what the company said: \\nStarting this quarter, our financial releases no longer include the non-GAAP revenue disclosures that we historically provided. To simplify our financial reporting, we add back non-cash stock-based compensation (SBC) to calculate non-GAAP results. Consistent with previous quarters, non-GAAP automotive gross margin will also exclude ZEV credit sales. \\n\\nTotal Q3 GAAP revenue was $2.30 billion, up 145% from Q3 2015, while total Q3 gross margin was 27.7%, compared to 21.6% in Q2. \\n\\nTotal automotive revenue was $2.15 billion on a GAAP basis, up 152% from Q3 2015. Our final Q3 delivery count was 24,821, over 300 more than the estimated delivery count we shared on October 2nd. Deliveries increased 114% from the third quarter of 2015, and was comprised of 16,047 Model S and 8,774 Model X vehicles. In addition, 5,065 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These vehicles will be delivered in Q4. \\n\\nOur Q3 GAAP net income was $22 million, or $0.14 per share on 157 million diluted shares, while our non-GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.71 per share on a diluted basis, after adding back $90 million of SBC. Both figures include an $0.08 per share loss of other expense, net, primarily related to foreign currency transactions and the conversion of most of our 2018 convertible notes. \\nConfused? So are we, and sadly charting the results does not help: \\n\\nAnd here are the company\\'s GAAP revenues: \\n\\nAlas, even looking at the company\\'s cash flow does not provide much apples to apples color. Here\\'s why: \\nWe hope that Elon Musk can provide some clarity on just what is going on here, because Wall Street has no idea. \\n* * * \\nGoing back to its core business, said that its final Q3 delivery count was 24,821, over 300 more than the estimated delivery count we shared on October 2nd. \" Deliveries increased 114% from the third quarter of 2015, and was comprised of 16,047 Model S and 8,774 Model X vehicles.

       "  'Tom Cahill | November 17, 2016 \\nIn a stunning move, President Obama has announced he won’t allow any oil and gas leases on land deemed sacred by the Blackfeet Tribe. \\nAfter the announcement, Devon Energy, which was hoping to drill on 130,000 acres in Montana — some of which housed Glacier National Park and Blackfeet land — will have all of its oil and gas leases cancelled on the disputed land. The Bureau of Land Management had previously granted 15 leases to Devon Energy in the northwestern part of the Big Sky State. \\n“We are proud to have worked alongside the Blackfeet Nation, U.S. Forest Service and Devon Energy to achieve this important milestone, rolling back decades-old leases and reinforcing the importance of developing resources in the right ways and the right places,” said Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in a public statement . \\nNational Parks Conservation Association official Michael Jamison told the Washington Post that the cancellation of the leases is an important milestone for the preservation of various protected species like wolf, bear, and elk. \\n“There aren’t many places like this left in the lower 48,” Jamison said. \\nThe move is particularly significant in the context of the ongoing protests at the construction site of the Dakota Access Pipeline, where hundreds of indigenous tribes have gathered with the Standing Rock Sioux to prevent the pipeline from being built. Protesters say the pipeline, which would run underneath the Missouri River, would endanger a crucial drinking water supply for millions of people in several states. \\nFor its part, Devon will receive a little over $200,000 for the cancellation of the leases, which were issued in the 1980s with no drilling occurring since the leases were granted. \\n\\nTom Cahill is a writer for US Uncut based in the Pacific Northwest.

       "  'The LPWAN: The Future of Powering the IoT? November 4, 2016 Google + As the predictions for the number of IoT devices worldwide edges into the billions, the question is becoming less about whether and how to connect devices, and more about how to sustain so many devices on existing networks.\\nConnectivity is a key to the function of the IoT, so many engineers are working on alternatives for getting data from point A to point B. But sustaining those billions of connections requires a wireless technology that can handle long distances, use minimal power, and cost less than what is being used for IoT devices now. \\nCurrently, short-range wireless connectivity isn’t necessarily an issue, as connectivity technology like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and Z-Wave. Longer range connectivity is effectively managed by 2G, 3G, and 4G LTE, with 5G wireless not too far off in the future. However, these tools for long-range wireless connectivity are not designed for the typical IoT device, that doesn’t require the same amount of power as a cellphone or other mobile device. These tools are better suited for larger devices, that contain larger batteries and can be regularly recharged, rather than a smaller, sensor-based device that either doesn’t have a battery or has a very small battery that cannot be recharged, or doesn’t need recharging on a regular basis. \\nAs developers continue to create devices using efficient, low-power microcontrollers and applications , it’s becoming increasingly clear that connectivity also needs to focus on implementing lower power options as well. Current connectivity options for IoT devices eat up too much battery life. One potential solution that is getting a lot of attention is a new kind of low-power, long-range wireless network: Low-Power WAN (LPWAN). ‘Help Us, LPWAN, You’re Our Only Hope’ \\nLPWAN may not be the only hope for a solution for the power problems facing the IoT, but it is showing the most potential. \\nThe idea of LPWAN is not a new one, either. Typically designed for machine-to-machine networking environments, LPWANs have lower power requirements in addition to a longer range, at a lower cost, than traditional wireless connectivity options. As a result, LPWAN is believed to be a better choice for IoT applications, since it transfers data at lower rates while also reducing power consumption. Since most home equipment offers more bandwidth than the typical IoT device needs, it uses more power than necessary, but a LPWAN network allows for more devices to be connected over a larger area, and offers improved machine-to-machine communication. \\nLPWANs also offer a longer range of connectivity than the usual home solutions, such as Wi-Fi — in some cases, the connectivity even extends for miles. This allows for connections at longer distances, which is important for the operation of some IoT devices. Drawbacks to the LPWAN \\nWhile the LPWAN holds a great deal of promise for the IoT going forward, there are some drawbacks. For starters, LPWAN technology was not initially designed for the IoT, so there is some question as to how it will actually work for IoT-connected devices in the long term. Because there are still questions about how to design devices to be as low-power as possible, there is no guarantee that LPWAN will end out as the best solution. \\nThere are also questions about how useful LPWANs will be once 5G technology is released; in other words, will 5G be able to handle the needs of the IoT better than any existing technology now? Not to mention, the idea of an LPWAN is relatively new, so there isn’t truly enough data to support claims about their cost, data rate, and battery life in terms of IoT devices. As more applications are deployed on the networks, it will be easier to see whether they can handle large-scale deployment and handle IoT applications effectively, but for now there are still questions. \\nThe explosion of the IoT is creating new challenges for companies that are still exploring the technologies and skills necessary to make everything work. However, choosing the right wireless network for connected devices is one of the most important priorities for any company, as they attempt to balance the myriad conflicting requirements. So for now, then, it appears that LPWAN has the most potential as a solution for wireless connectivity, and will be the best option for the foreseeable future. '],\n",

       "  \"Getty - Tim Sloan IJR Opinion is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \\nA Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton presidency is rather mind-boggling to many of us. At last check, there are over 300 million people in the United States, and we can't find anyone better than HRC and 'The Donald'? \\nSadly, we are watching the American presidential election devolve into a competition between the DNC and the GOP as to who can put forward the most corrupt, asinine, power hungry candidate possible. Although the race to the bottom is a voting conundrum for both sides, the extreme left has posited a unique argument that can help social conservatives when it comes to personal principles and the voting booth. \\nIn a world where biological sex is gleefully separated from gender identification, shouldn’t it be acceptable that one might separate selecting a candidate from voting for him or her? Put another way: if having male genitalia doesn't necessarily make you male, then selecting someone for president doesn’t necessarily mean that you voted for that person. Right? \\nThis type of disconnected reality is only fair if everyone can play the game. Wow - this is an existential moment! I feel better already. To quote The Kinks : “Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls. It’s a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world…” \\nThank you, transgender community, for helping me work through this “mixed up, muddled up” election. Although I will select Donald Trump for President of the United States, I will not be voting for him. \\nThat’s right. I’m voting for three reasons and three reasons only: \\nI’m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. \\nI’m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. \\nI’m voting to curtail the Clintons' power. \\nThere you have it: three solid reasons for selecting Donald Trump without voting for him. It’s time to be pragmatic. It’s time to select a candidate who will create the greatest amount of disturbance within the system albeit with the least amount of power. \\nWho might that be? Let’s see: “ eeny, meeny, miny, moe , H-R-C has got to go! ” Really, people - how long are we going to elect the same old political hacks who have consolidated their power for decades? \\nIt is amazing that in a “free” country we’ve allowed the Clintons to run the DNC (and thus a fair portion of Washington, D.C.) for nearly 30 years! They have manipulated the system for their personal gain to the tune of $110 million! They are willing to sell our country to the nation or company that will pay the highest speaking fee . They lie, cheat, and steal their way to the top. \\nIs this not problematic? Power - and the lack of - is the most important thing for the next president, yet the media isn’t discussing it. \\nHere’s the most substantial difference between Donald Trump and HRC. If elected, Donald Trump would have a fraction of the power of HRC. For crying out loud: 2/3 of the GOP is already against him . Do you hear any major resistance rising up against HRC by DNC insiders? No. Progressives should wake up to the fact that if they vote for HRC, then they prove that their Occupy Wall Street, stick-it-to-the-man gig is a complete sham. \\nIndeed, if progressives vote for HRC, then they’re either quintessential hypocrites who couldn’t care less about the American people or they’re complete idiots being played like a drum by the powers that be in the DNC. \\nMake no mistake about it. I’ll select Trump’s name for president, but I’m not voting for him. Rather, I’m voting to limit the power of the presidency; I’m voting to stop HRC’s quest to become the first Queen of America by wielding the power of her husband’s former kingship. \\nWake up, America! We fought a revolution to prevent such a consolidation of power. I would like to think Americans are smart enough to stop the Clintons from gaining even more of it. \\nProverbs 15:27 - “He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house.” \"],\n",

       "  'The 53 rd anniversary of the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy is remembered and his life is celebrated.\\nOn Nov. 22, 1963, the 35 th President of the United States was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, at 12:30 p.m., in Dallas, Texas. He was in a motorcade with his wife Jacqueline, the Governor of Texas John Connally and his wife. They were traveling through Dealey Plaza when he was shot.\\nHe won the 1960 election by a narrow margin, although, in 1961, more than 60 percent of the population claimed they voted for Kennedy. He brought a special new aspect to the White House; a young family, culture, laughter, and class. Most importantly, Americans felt he brought the people hope.\\nKennedy was the only Catholic President of the United States. He once stated:\\nThere are three things in life; God, human folly, and laughter. The first two are beyond our comprehension, we must make the best of the third.\\nThe Life of Kennedy: His great-grandparents were immigrants from County Wexford, Ireland. He was fortunate to have not suffered poverty or discrimination, except for the Boston Brahmins, who believed he was “Shanty Irish.” He knew he was a Fenian.\\nDuring World War II, his father’s influence helped him enlist in the United States Navy. Kennedy was a skipper of PT-109, in the Salmon Islands. A Japanese destroyer cut his boat in two, in a night action. He was thrown back into the bridge, causing a lifetime back injury. Despite his pain, the skipper collected his crew and saved a burned crewmate by placing a belt under the man’s arms and towing him to shore, holding the belt in his teeth. This act of valor earned him the Navy and Marine Corps. Medal and a Purple Heart.\\nThe Kennedy Presidency: October 1962, the president had to face Russia, concerning the missiles in Cuba. Generals wanted to go to war. However, Kennedy had experienced war, thus, he negotiated a settlement. The world viewed this as a victory for Kennedy.\\nOn June 11, 1963, his Civil Rights speech was televised across the nation. He asked Americans to allow equal rights for their fellow African-American citizens. In his speech, Kennedy stated that the nation was facing a moral issue that was “as old as the Scriptures and as clear as the American Constitution.”\\nPresident Kennedy’s Civil Rights Bill was passed by Lyndon Johnson, in 1964.\\nAlso in June 1963, Kennedy delivered a speech in Berlin. This famous speech is known as “Ich bin EIN Berliner.” He offered the citizens of the country hope and warned Russia that their time was coming.\\nHe left Berlin and flew to Ireland to address the Irish Parliament. Kennedy made a point to visit Arbour Hill, the mass grave of 14 of the martyrs in the Easter Rebellion. He is the only United States leader to honor this memorial. He read the names of those buried there, while the Irish Prime Minister Sean Lemass walked by his side. Lemass knew many of the leaders in that grave.\\nOn Aug. 5, 1963, Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This was supposed to make the world a safer place. Nonetheless, four days later, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, the infant son of the president, died. He was two days old.\\nMonday, November 18, President Kennedy made a stopover in Tampa, Florida. He was the first president to be a guest of this city. Among the multitude of conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of the former president are a few that involve his visit to Tampa.\\nTampa Conspiracy Theory: One of the many conspiracy theories claims there was a gunman at the Floridian Hotel. This gunman was prepared to assassinate President Kennedy. This theory is supported by the reports of organized crime in Tampa Bay. Per the story, the Floridian Hotel would be a good place for a sniper to set-up, in preparation to take a shot.\\nOswald Acted Alone Despite Disbelief: However, Warren Commission investigated the assassination of President Kennedy and determined, in September 1964, that there was no evidence of a conspiracy. It was concluded that Oswald acted on his own.\\nThe Associated Press conducted a poll in April 2013, and 50 percent of the American population believed more than one person was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. They also believe it was a conspiracy. However, 24 percent of the people think Oswald acted on his own and 16 percent were undecided. A Gallup poll, in 2003, revealed 75 percent of Americans thought there was a conspiracy involved in the death of the president.\\nIn Remembrance: Springfield, Massachusetts, held a ceremony, to honor former President Kennedy, at 1 p.m., on Nov. 22, 2016, at the Eternal Flame in Forest Park. U.S. Rep. Richard Neal and Mayor Domenic Sarno were in attendance.\\nA memorial wreath and three red roses were left at the Eternal Flame.

None of us ever wants to confront the reality that one of our kids is sick, but that’s just what singer Michael Bublé and his wife, Luisana, are facing. \\nTheir eldest son, Noah, was just diagnosed with cancer. He’s just three years old. \\nThe family were dealt the tragic blow after the youngster visited doctors with a suspected case of mumps , Argentinian website La Nacion reports . \\n“They’re staying positive and Noah is a fighter.” \\nArgentinian journalist Tomas Dente read out a text message from Daniela on a morning TV show which said: “To tell you the truth I’m devastated. This is very recent. \\n“The only thing I ask is that you don’t speculate because not everyone has children and can understand what this means. \\nA story on Buzzfeed shares the couple’s statement, in which the singer asks for privacy as he and his family fight this battle. \\nAccording to BuzzFeed , the Argentinian newspaper La Nacion reported that Noah was initially taken to the doctor for a suspected case of the mumps and was subsequently diagnosed with cancer, every parent’s worst nightmare. \\nAs Bublé said in his post, “We are devastated about the recent cancer diagnosis of our oldest son Noah who is currently undergoing treatment in the US.

       "  '\\nRapper Kanye West has come out in support of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, drawing boos and whistles from fans. \\nKanye West has always been something of a provocateur and a nihilist, and is staunchly anti-political correctness. \\nLast night he stirred a maybe unprecedented level of controversy, however, declaring at a Saint Pablo Tour show in San Jose: “I would have voted on Trump”. West told the audience at a concert in San Jose, California on Thursday night that he didn’t vote in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential elections “but if I would have voted, I would have voted for Trump.” \\n“This is my platform and I’m going to talk about the paradigm shift that’s happening right now,” he said at the top of a 40-minute political speech that came at the cost of several songs. \\nIt’s hard to ascertain exactly the point he was trying to make as we only have tweets and videos from attendees, not a transcript, to go off, but it sounds as though he was mostly praising the disruptive nature of Trump’s campaign, which ‘inspired racists to reveal themselves’. “I would’ve voted for Trump”– @kanyewest pic.twitter.com/XtyUteCgUZ \\n— albertoreyes (@albertoreyes) November 18, 2016 \\n\\n“Whether you voted for Hillary or Trump, this is a safe space for both of you,” he told the audience, asking any Trump voters to make themselves known. He also reiterated his desire to run for president in 2020, saying his focus would be on education and that his campaign would use a different political model. \\n“Stop focusing on racism,” he added, declaring sombrely: “We are in a racist country – period.” His stance stands in stark contrast to 2005 Kanye, who famously declared that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” in the wake of the devestating Hurricane Katrina. \\nThe concert received an understandably mixed response. \\nKanye was apparently happy when one woman screamed that she loved him in spite of his appreciation of Trump’s campaign, but there was also a lot of booing, stunned silence and even a few projectiles – one of which was a Yeezy shoe, which Kanye promptly signed and returned to the thrower.

       "  'Email \\nIn an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds, it’s often difficult to separate fact from fiction. That was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of President Obama began to circulate online, with many insisting that the image was the real, unedited deal. But today that picture was officially debunked: The photo of Obama with a speech balloon saying “Islam is my main thing” has been proven to be doctored. \\nWow. This is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt! \\nTake a look at the photo in question above. In it, you can clearly see Obama proudly declaring his unshakeable Islamic faith. \\nAt first glance, the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that Obama may be Muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most far-right critics, who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs. But when the image went viral on Twitter, one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring: \\nMany users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in. A graphic designer named Brendan McCann, whose Twitter bio says he’s been in the industry for over a decade, quickly answered the call. \\nBut it was Snopes that officially put the matter to rest. After scouring the internet far and wide, they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph, taken during one of the president’s official White House photo ops, and there’s no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the Quran anywhere in sight. \\nTake a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved: \\nWell, there you have it. It looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the president’s head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top. It’s a powerful effect, but it’s definitely not real.

       "  ' Barrel Bomb: The Cataclysmic Close of Campaign 2016 By Chris Floyd\\n Well, here we are: at the bottom of the barrel under forty feet of slag. In a few days\\x92 time, we\\x92ll know our fate: the five-alarm fire of Trump Rule (oh, how those police unions are chomping at the bit!) or the Clinton Age of Hyper-War (oh, how those neocons are chomping at the bit!). In either case, the entrenched coagulation of corporate interests and war profiteers that have strangled the peace, prosperity and prospects of the American people will not be budged an inch. The change that people are so desperately hungry for \\x97 so hungry that that some of them might well elect an Establishment insider whose sinister clowning makes him appear to be a \\x91rebel\\x92 \\x97 will not come. Thus their bitterness will grow deeper, more sour, erupting more and more often in physical violence: from militarized police against protestors, from Trump-empowered racists (if he wins or loses), from extremist militias, from angry, maddened people on every side. And of course there will be more \\x97 much more \\x97 of the horrific, never-ending, globe-spanning violence of the bipartisan Terror War that churns on and on, no matter who is sitting temporarily in the White House.\\nThere\\x92s no use in pretending that\\x92s not what we face. But there\\x92s also no use in pretending that this situation is somehow sui generis , some terribly unlucky conflation of unforeseen circumstances coming together at this particular time. It is in fact the culmination and embodiment of the deliberate choices of the most powerful forces in society: the choices to enrich themselves beyond all reason and extend their military and economic dominance over the earth.\\nIt doesn\\x92t matter that many if not most of the practitioners and functionaries of this system \\x93believe\\x94 in its rightness. It doesn\\x92t matter that brutal neoliberal nostrums and extremist imperial notions have become religious dogmas for those who see themselves as the \\x93meritocracy.\\x94 It doesn\\x92t matter if the leaders and factotums genuinely believe in the \\x93exceptionalism\\x94 they preach or if they are cynical power-seekers. It doesn\\x92t matter if they actually believe their rapacious financial machinations are reflections of the \\x93natural law\\x94 of the \\x93the market\\x94 that will eventually benefit all, or if they know themselves to be what they really are: ugly souls disfigured by greed. The end result has been the same: a long series of deliberate choices by a bipartisan elite that have hollowed out the lives and communities and futures of millions of Americans, and created a living hell of war, ruin and hatred over much of the earth.\\nThis is a system that has delegitimized itself, a system that has undermined its own institutions. Through its own actions, it has rotted out the foundations of trust and reason which once upheld it. Some might say, \\x93Oh, but there\\x92s been a decades-long, concentrated effort by right-wing billionaires and corporate forces to foment ideological and religious extremism to undermine the legitimacy of secular government, which might restrict their profiteering or let more people have a share in power.\\x94 And that\\x92s true. But it\\x92s been accompanied at every step by the collusion and cowardice of the putative opposition. The so-called New Democrats, exemplified by the Clintons, jettisoned concern for the common good to embrace \\x93centrist\\x94 and \\x93technocratic\\x94 policies: i.e., to adopt the neoliberal dogma that unbridled pursuit of private profit by a connected elites will somehow, someday, lead to general prosperity. The idea that the party should fight to improve the lives of ordinary people in the here and now, to fight for their quality of life in a genuine, substantive way, came to be seen as old-hat, a quaint and fusty notion of has-beens and dreamers who didn\\x92t understand the way the world really worked. A true, savvy \\x93moderate\\x94 knows you must compromise every ideal, show yourself to be a willing and avid servant of the monied interests and the militarists, in order to gain power so you can make a few cosmetic changes around the edges, a few little social improvements here and there (but only \\x97 of course! \\x97 in \\x93partnership\\x94 with private interests), but never, ever challenge the system at its core.\\nThis is the only deal in town: outright, unvarnished right-wing rule, or simpering, cowardly \\x93moderate\\x94 management of a violent, rapacious system. That\\x92s been the choice on offer since 1976. That\\x92s the choice on offer today. The only difference is that the system has metastasized to a monstrous degree over the years: lacking any genuine opposition, the system has grown more violent, more rapacious.\\nEstablishment collusion \\x97 and Democratic cowardice \\x97 finally and completely degraded and delegitimized the American electoral process 16 years ago, when the Supreme Court \\x97 with two members who had direct family ties to the Bush campaign \\x97 stopped a recount that would have resulted in the actual winner of the election to take office. This outrageous action was accepted by every single organ and institution of the American system. (With the momentary exception of the Black Congressional Caucus, whose members tried, in vain, to get a single Democratic senator to challenge the result.) Instead, Americans were encouraged to applaud the fact that power had changed hands \\x93without tanks in the street.\\x94 That is, we were to celebrate that an actual coup d\\x92etat had taken place before our eyes without the slightest show of resistance.\\nOnce in place, the coup regime \\x97 staffed at the highest levels by extremists who a year before had publicly called for a vast militarization of American policy and society, even if the public had to be \\x93galvanized\\x94 by \\x93a new Pearl Harbor\\x94 \\x97 led the nation into a disastrous war based on false pretenses, a vast crime that not only killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people but has led directly to unbridled turmoil, extremism, conflict and corruption around the world. The elite-supported coup regime instituted torture programs and death squads, and launched an orgy of war profiteering unprecedented in world history. The regime then presided over the worst economic collapse in generations.\\nNot a single member of the regime was ever tried \\x97 or even investigated, at even the most preliminary level \\x97 for a single crime committed during its time in power. There were no high-profile Congressional investigations into the hideous carnage and ruin and instability they wrought; not even a \\x93Chilcot Commission\\x94 into the origins of the war, as the UK belatedly launched. Instead the regime\\x92s leaders and top factotums were heaped with honors and wealth. Today their endorsement is eagerly sought \\x97 and gained \\x97 by the \\x93progressive\\x94 Democratic candidate for president.\\nIn 2008, the desperate electorate turned to a figure presented to them as an outsider who would at last bring real change. He had the trappings of difference \\x97 a black man with a Muslim name, who spoke eloquently of peace and social justice, who most people thought was far to the left but voted for him anyway. But Barack Obama was of course a meritocratic \\x93centrist\\x94 to his core. Riding an enormous wave of popularity, and a strong Congressional majority, he proceeded to bail out Wall Street fraudsters and finaglers with tax money and create a health care system based on the plan of a rightwing think-tank that prioritized corporate profit \\x97 and probably killed the chance for a genuinely public health care system for generations, if not for good. He also doubled down on the Terror War, expanding it to more countries, extended Bush\\x92s death squads, helped destroy nations like Libya and Yemen (thus spawning more chaos and terror), expanded illegal surveillance of the populace (and the world) to an extent beyond the wildest dreams of the Stasi or KGB. And after saving Big Money from itself and securing the guaranteed profits of the healthcare-insurance corporate complex, he spent most of his time on the domestic front trying to strike a \\x93grand bargain\\x94 with Republicans to cut Social Security and Medicare.\\nAgain, all hopes of any real change were thwarted. So now the nation swings from being ready to embrace a perceived leftist to the brink of voting in a bellicose rightist as it seeks the genuine change no one will give them. Of course, after the scorched-earth tactics of bipartisan neoliberalism and the inevitable moral degradation and brutalization that comes from year after year after year of vicious aggressive war, the choice for Trump is more nihilistic. It\\x92s as if people believe positive change is no longer possible \\x97 so let\\x92s tear everything down and see what happens. (This is the actual, open philosophy of the Breitbart gang, who are now directing Trump\\x92s campaign.)\\nEven if Clinton wins, this nihilism will still be rampant. And given that she happily embodies the bipartisan Establishment now roundly despised on all sides for its many depredations, the nihilism will grow even worse \\x97 especially as she has given no indication whatsoever that she will even try to make substantive changes in the neoliberal-militarist system that is strangling us. Quite the contrary.\\nSo yes, this has been a campaign like no other \\x97 but mostly because it has brought the systematic decay of the Republic into the sharpest possible relief, and has shown, more clearly than before, that the neoliberal-militarist ascendency offers no hope for a better life, a better world; indeed, that it offers nothing at all \\x97 except more violence, more bitterness, more ruin, more degradation for us all.\\nChris Floyd blogs at www.chris-floyd.com .'],\n",

The paper claims they will strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in stories brought to the public. This announcement is almost considered an apology to its readers for providing a year and a half of unbalanced and unhinged coverage of the presidential race. \\nSean Hannity suggests that Trump must ignore the media and trust his gut instincts. He was sad to see the 165-year-old paper destroy their credibility over the election season. It was obvious to dedicated readers that the Times had abandoned its old coverage standards. Stories were unrelentingly hostile towards Trump and his supporters. Reporters were including their personal opinions and political analysis in the news coverage. This allowed animosity toward Trump to be spread all over social media by political reporters. Front page stories on The New York Times were accusing Trump of lying, but the paper never published the same findings in reference to Hillary Clinton . The paper’s liberal readership has even gotten tired of reporting that resembles state controlled propaganda of totalitarian regimes. Newt Gingrich destroys the New York Times credibility with seven simple questions. \\nThe New York Times has struggled mightily to answer some serious questions posed by the former United States House of Representatives speaker. Gingrich, a Republican, has asked the times whether they have any reporters, editors or columnists that will say they voted for Trump. He elaborated to ask if they have since hired any Trump supporters to work those positions for the Times. The paper struggled to say whether or not it has hired any Republican reporters at all. \\nGingrich has also asked if the New York Times has changed its policies allowing journalists to express their opinions about events and people they are covering. The fourth question asked by Gingrich wondered if the Times reporters would surrender any Pulitzer Prizes awarded for news stories containing personal opinions. Here are the final questions that the Times struggled to address. “Have its editors retracted misleading news headlines that expressed opinions — such as the paper’s coverage of Trump’s tax returns?” “Has it fired reporters who admitted to writing politically motivated ‘news’ stories and encouraged interview subjects to talk to them so they could stop Trump?” “Has it retracted its shameful election-eve front-page story ‘reporting’ on Trump’s innermost thoughts and feelings, virtually every sentence of which is filled with reporters’ opinions and speculations–featuring claims like ‘he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention” \\nSources: '],\n",

       "  '. Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his government\\x92s repeated affronts to the White House.\\nIn the past weeks alone, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last year\\x92s nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact, which bolstered Hitler; and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the \\x93ethnic cleansing\\x94 of Jews.\\nAmerican president Barack Obama, meanwhile, hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic party\\x92s candidate to succeed Mr Obama in November\\x92s election.\\nIn reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Israeli expectations of a $4.5bn-a-year deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran deal.\\nIn fact, Israel already receives roughly $3.8bn \\x96 if Congress\\x92s assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds.\\nThe deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollar\\x92s depreciation against the shekel.\\nA bigger blow still is the White House\\x92s demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry.\\nNonetheless, Washington\\x92s renewed military largesse \\x96 in the face of almost continual insults \\x96 inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog. Even The New York Times has described the aid package as \\x93too big\\x94.\\nSince the 1973 war, Israel has received at least $100bn in military aid, with more assistance hidden from view. Back in the 1970s, Washington paid half of Israel\\x92s military budget. Today it still foots a fifth of the bill, despite Israel\\x92s economic success.\\nBut the US expects a return on its massive investment. As the late Israeli politician-general Ariel Sharon once observed, \\xadIsrael has been a US \\x93aircraft carrier\\x94 in the Middle East, acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit Washington.\\nAlmost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraq\\x92s and Syria\\x92s nuclear programmes. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal.\\nIn addition, Israel\\x92s US-sponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry, the country\\x92s most powerful lobby. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East.\\nThe first F-35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December \\x96 their various components produced in 46 US states \\x96 will increase the clamour for the cutting-edge warplane.\\nIsrael is also a \\x93front-line laboratory\\x94, as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend, that develops and field-tests new technology Washington can later use itself.\\nThe US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome \\x96 which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation \\x96 it largely paid for. Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyber\\xadwarfare, such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Iran\\x92s civilian nuclear programme.\\nBut the clearest message from Israel\\x92s new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians: Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood.\\nSome believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace.\\nHopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal.\\nIf Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.\\nMr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal \\x96 he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity.\\n- See more at: http://www.jonathan-cook.net/2016-09-19/palestinians-lose-in-us-military-aid-deal-with-israel/#sthash.fL4Eq28N.dpuf Can U.S. Elections Really Be Stolen?

I have no doubt — maybe Huma didn’t take a sledgehammer to her devices the way Hillary Clinton did. But this is not what resulted in the reopening of this case. No way, shape, manner, or form. They know Julian Assange — there’s too much in WikiLeaks that is coming, that has tipped them off that they’re dead. That they’re about to be exposed. And that is, more than anything else, this is about preservation now. \\nBecause James Comey, and and now we get back to… this this sky Andrew McCabe who was the FBI deputy director supervising the investigation of Clinton not long after Terry McAuliffe through a PAC gave $675,000 dollars to Jo McCabe, the wife of the chief the FBI deputy Director looking into the investigation into Clinton for a long shot bid, and that $675,000 came from Hillary, who went out there and raise money for the Super PACs that McAuliffe coudl give it to her. \\nThe wife of the guy doing the key investigation here. Now if that doesn’t impress you, I don’t know what does.. \\nNow let’s go back to Trey Gowdy grilling James Comey. What did he say? \\nSecretary Clinton said she never sent or received classified information over a private email server, is that true? “Comey: Our investigation found there was classified information sent.” \\nStop right there. Comey is admitting a crime is committed. That raises the question why did Comey then make a determination on his own not to send this to or grand jury or special prosecutor or anybody else? In other words, the statute requires, she doesn’t even have to be negligent. I’m sorry the statute requires negligence or gross negligence, yet Hillary was knowingly, purposefully, and WikiLeaks proves this, in her decisions and actions setting up a server under her control. \\nHere’s the question Comey has to ask: Why did you give all these people immunity?Why did you destroy evidence in the case as part of a proffered deal, why in under any circumstances do you close this case down when the evidence was overwhelming and incontrovertible and had sent numerous other people to jail for a far lesser offenses? That’s called a two-tiered Justice system, that’s a problem… \\nHillary knowingly and purposely hurt decisions and actions set up a server under her exclusive control and possession in order to control (violate the law) in ordered to control information that was available to the American public and Congress regarding actions as Secretary of State. \\nFurthermore, she took those government-owned communications into our own personal possession after leaving her position, knowingly and willingly attempted to destroy them, by the way that’s obstruction of justice, violation of the law, penalty of which a minor offenses you never get a government position for the rest of your life. And was so nefarious in her actions, could never be known used as evidence… \\nThis gets more curious day by day. Now there were reports out today that FBI agents were reportedly close to revolting over the treatment of Clinton, they’re so disgusted, and every FBI special agent I know … nobody has a good answer because they don’t understand why organizes pretty deep \\nNew emails tied to discovered– I don’t believe the New York Times, and I think the the FBI did this because they know what is coming.

Image Credit: Manny Hernandez/Getty Images \\nWhile initial reports indicated that alcohol was not a factor in the crash, it is now believed that the men were drinking the night of the accident. \\nAs the Miami Herald reports, the search warrant affidavit suggests that the diver could smell a “heavy” alcohol odor on Fernández and his friends. \\nThe last known picture taken of Fernández the night he died was outside the dockside bar American Social. Managers of the bar confirmed that Fernández and his two friends were there, but it's unknown if the men were drinking. \\nThe affidavit says that the driver of the vessel was driving with “recklessness” that was “exacerbated by the consumption of alcohol,” according to the Herald. And while toxicology reports have been completed, the report has not yet been released by investigators.

The Miami Herald reported that the affidavit also states that the associate medical examiner who conducted the autopsies shows that all three men had water in the lungs and trauma consistent with a boat crash. \\nThe exact cause of death, however, was not mentioned. \\nIt also hasn't yet been confirmed who was driving the boat. Speaking with the Miami Herald, FWC spokesperson Lorenzo Veloz, says that he had been on Fernández’s boat “several times, but that Fernández had not been captain;” it's unknown how much experience Fernandez had captaining the boat. \\nThe affidavit states that the crimes being investigating are Boating Homicide While Intoxicated and Vessel Homicide. However, because all three men who were on the boat are deceased, it is unclear against whom charges could be brought. It is also unclear whether civil charges will be brought. \\nFernández's ashes have since been spread at sea, his favorite place to be: #JoseFernandez 's ashes scattered at site of boat accident.

Over 11 percent of those accidents occurred in Florida, and alcohol was the reason behind over 250 of the accidents. \\nFernández was seen as the future of major league baseball.

       " [\"Teacher To 11 yr Old: 'I Can't Wait Until Trump Is Elected,He's Going To Deport All You Muslims'\",\n",
       "  '0 427 \\n“That’s going to be you,” the Academy of Excellence teacher allegedly warned a 12-year-old Muslim student after showing the class a movie about the 9/11 attacks. And if that sounds outrageous, brace yourself because it gets a lot worse. \\nNo wonder the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Arizona are siccing the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education on this travesty of a public charter school and this shameful example of an educator’s sorry a**. Heather Weaver from the ACLU’s national office reports they’ve filed formal complaints on behalf of the Muslim student and his family. \\nAsli Noor and her five children are refugees who settled in Phoenix, Arizona after fleeing Somalia. Like most parents, she wants opportunities and a good education for her children. And for many families — especially those living in low-income neighborhoods — that means a public charter school like the sadly misnamed “Excellence Academy.” \\nThe boy and his eight-year-old sister (referred to in the complaint as A.A. and F.A.) had started the 2015-2016 school year when the family’s new set of troubles began. \\nAccording to the complaints, an “Academy of Excellence” teacher named Faye Myles began “singling out” the then 11-year-old, sixth grade Muslim student as the 2015-16 school year began for “disfavorable treatment because of his faith and nationality.” \\n‘Another time, when A.A. raised his hand to answer a question, his teacher snapped at him\\u200a—\\u200a“All you Muslims think you are so smart”\\u200a—\\u200ain front of the entire class.’ \\nOh, and then the boy recalls the math and science teacher for grades 5-8 digressing into a special kind of lesson in civics and current events. \\n‘I can’t wait until Trump is elected. He’s going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn’t be given visas. They’ll probably take away your visa and deport you. You’re going to be the next terrorist, I bet.’ \\nFaye Myles also allegedly found other ways to wound her young Muslim student with her bigotry. She repeatedly denied him the right to pray during recess, which is hard to imagine ever happening to a Christian student. The child also claims his “Academy of Excellence” teacher would also would tell him to “shut up” and punish him during class “downtime” when the other students were allowed to talk with each other. \\nThe bus rides home added to the child’s misery as his classmates began to follow the teacher’s example and pile on the insults. \\n‘On the bus ride home, A.A.’s classmates took up his teacher’s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant crusade, taunting him about the fact that his visa would be revoked because he is a Muslim, calling him a “terrorist,” and accusing him of planning to blow up the bus.’ \\nThe child, of course, started feeling anxious and physically ill “with a stomach ache” and had no desire to return to the “Academy of Excellence.” \\nIn January, Asli Noor met with school officials to complain about these incidents. Three days later, the school asked her to pick her son up early because he had supposedly tried to open the school bus’ emergency window. Noor demanded they verify these accusations with footage from the security camera but school officials refused. \\nAnd then Brenda Nelson, an “Academy of Excellence” board member, printed out two “voluntary” withdrawal forms for A.A. and his younger sister F.A. She then allegedly ordered Ms. Noor to sign them, saying: \\n‘Get your kids out of here. I don’t want them here.’ \\nWhen Asri Noor begged for time to find another school for her children, Brenda Nelson callously refused. \\nUnfortunately, these incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry in publicly-funded schools are happening more frequently. Think Progress reports that even in schools where teachers try to fight it, Trump-inspired bullying is a serious issue. \\n‘In spite of some teachers’ valiant efforts to teach students about Trump, it would appear that schoolchildren already invoke the candidate’s name to scare their Latino and Muslim classmates, referencing the candidate’s harsh claims of Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists.’ \\nAnd, sadly, it’s not just the kids. \\n‘A predominantly Latino elementary school in California was graffiti-tagged with the words “Build the wall higher” last week, alluding to Trump’s policy plan to build a southern U.S. border wall to keep out undocumented immigrants.’ \\nAnd in case you assume the “Academy of Excellence” teacher is one of those mean white Trump supporters, you’re wrong. Apparently, she’s a mean black Trump supporter. @KhaledBeydoun The teacher works at Academy of Excellence & her name is Faye Myles per the article. She should be called out. pic.twitter.com/BbL3YdzEG8 \\n— John Q Archibald (@JohnQarchibald) October 30, 2016 \\nFeatured image: Lynn Koenig via Getty Images . Share this Article! '],\n",
       " ['When Dad’s Kind Birthday Gift For Ex-Wife Has His Friends Puzzled, He Explains Who It’s Really For',\n",
       "  'Share on Twitter \\nOn October 21, 2016, father of two Billy Flynn woke up early. He bought his ex-wife a bouquet of flowers, a card, and a gift, and he helped their kids make their mom breakfast for her birthday. \\nFlynn was questioned about why he doing something nice for his ex-wife. This, he says on Facebook, annoys him. \\nWarning: Graphic Language Loading Facebook Post... \\nHe writes, in part: \\n“[I\\'m going to] break it down for you all. I\\'m raising two little men. The example I set for how I treat their mom is going to significantly shape how they see and treat women, and affect their perception of relationships.” \\nNow don\\'t get Flynn wrong, it hasn\\'t always been this easy. In fact, he tells Independent Journal Review that it took him and his ex-wife a while to create a mutually respectful relationship. \\nBut as Flynn points out, when a divorce involves children, the well-being of those children is much more important than how the adults feel about each other. \\nThe proud father credits their two boys with inspiring them to work hard on their new relationship: \\n\"It definitely wasn\\'t easy up front. I\\'d say it took us a good year to get it right. \\nDivorce is hard and I think we all do and say some things that really aren\\'t our best selves. But we always put the kids first, and honestly, I think that focus helped us repair our relationship into one of mutual respect over time, and our kids win as a result.\" \\nFlynn tells Independent Journal Review that he believes it is “extremely important” for parents to show care and respect for one another, especially when they are around their kids. Loading Facebook Post... \\nHe explains: \\n\"I\\'m not advocating that everyone can or should do what we do for each other to model for the kids. But I believe it is extremely important for parents to show each other respect and care in front of the kids. If your ex doesn\\'t have a new [significant other], you got to make sure those kids have Mother\\'s and Father\\'s Day cards, birthday gifts, etc. \\nKids want to care for their parents by nature, but they cant do it alone. It\\'s our job to facilitate that. So even if your ex is a terrible person in your eyes, you need to set it aside and realize your kids love this person. Seeing you mistreat someone they love is traumatic, whether you want to own it or not. \\nSo focus on the kids, make a pact, and I think you\\'ll be surprised to find that your mutual focus on the kids will actually benefit your post-divorce relationship because it takes the spotlight off your individual hurts and anger and resentment.\" \\nAs Flynn says on Facebook, if others in a similar situations aren\\'t modeling “good relationship behavior,” then he suggests they wise up and be an example for their children. \\nSome may say it\\'s impossible, but Flynn couldn\\'t disagree more. He tells Independent Journal Review that while establishing a mutual understanding with his ex-wife was hard, it was possible. And he knows that if he did it, you can do it too. \\nBy being able to rise above all the drama, co-parenting will turn into “raising good men and strong women,” which as Flynn says, is something we need now more than ever.

       "  'Email Print In every competition out there, there will be a winner and a loser. It’s just the way that competitions work. Literally everywhere you go there are competitions going on and there are always winners and losers. When we are children, we are always taught to be gracious losers. Yes sometimes losing a tough competition hurts, but if you accept it graciously, people will always praise your character. The problem with today’s young generation is that they have forgotten how to lose graciously. Since the announcement that Donald Trump has won the presidential election, liberals have been protesting this victory. They’re literally ignoring everything that has been taught to them since we were children. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like the result; Trump won the election and that is a fact. But these protests continue and there is one person that seems to be the mastermind behind it. That would be the ultra liberal billionaire George Soros. He was also responsible for financing some of the protest groups that was designed to have violence at the Trump rallies. During the election season, it was discovered that Soros was behind some of the protestor’s actions. He was paying them to create a scene and cause violence that would have the media talking about the Trump rallies. Now this shouldn’t have been happening in the first place but it was. And now that Trump has been elected president of the United States, there are people that are out on the streets protesting his victory. It’s a little ironic considering that liberals were the ones that were complaining about how Trump wouldn’t accept the election results if fraud was detected. Here is the issue though. There are people out on the streets that are protesting a presidential election. These are the same people that were the ones inciting violence at the Trump rallies. And those people were paid by Soros to start, so it’s likely that he is the one that is paying them to start civil unrest now. And there is a specific reason that Soros wants to have violence at the protests. That would mean that President Obama would have to declare Martial Law. This is how it works. It’s literally a domino effect. There are people out protesting the election results. But when they start having mass amounts of violence at the protests then the entire country is going to start noticing. If that happens then there is going to be pressure on the president to solve it. President Obama would then declare Martial Law. Martial Law is when the president has to suspend transfer of power due to the fact that there is a “National Emergency.” Therefore if that would happen then Trump wouldn’t be able to see the White House because Obama would still be the president of the United States. There is a good chance that this has been the back up plan for some liberals all along. And there is proof out there that the protests are staged. There are protests going on all over the United States and in one part of the nation, Austin, Texas, they found the buses that were used to bring the people in. Again these are planned in order to create civil unrest. And there is more proof. The signs that the people brought to the protests were all created and printed by groups related to the Soros cause. You can’t just print thousands of signs on a whim. These events have to be planned and thought out. And that is exactly what was happening. Finally the last bit of proof was that the Democrats and Soros have paid people to protest and create a disturbance at Trump events before. Since they have done it in the past, they are definitely going to do it now. And the Democrats are willing to pay them to create this disturbance. But the scariest part about all this is the fact that people are actually volunteering to protest the election just because Trump won. Again we are taught from a young age to accept defeat with graciousness. Right now they are acting like a bunch of spoiled kids because they didn’t get their way. And now there is a possibility that Obama is going to declare Martial Law because of these protestors. They couldn’t accept the fact that the country spoke and they wanted Trump in charge. But now they are actively interfering with a Democratic election because they want to complain about the choice. Again this is all most likely due to Soros. And he has had a hand in it before. He wants to see a globalized country and that means that he will do whatever he can to make it happen. That includes ordering an attack on Trump Tower in Chicago . That was where some of the protests in the country were happening. But he also had a hand in trying to fix the election. In 16 States they were using voting machines that were being produced by Soros controlled companies . Of course that meant that he was going to do what he could to rig the election. It most likely wouldn’t have mattered if you voted Trump; the machines were going to submit for Clinton. Share this article to show people that Soros has a plan for all of these protests. He wants to make sure that they create enough of a civil disturbance that Obama will declare Martial Law and stop the transfer of power from him to Trump. That way the globalist agenda could still happen. H/T: Conservative Daily Post However the best option is to not engage with the people that are out there. It’s like handling a two-year-old child that is throwing a temper tantrum. If you just ignore them they will settle down. Therefore just ignore the protestors and don’t engage with them. \\nIf you haven’t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment... '],\n",

The decision to use the apartment as a museum was made in December 2015, and a small exhibition was held in the space in May. \\n“Small and very intimate, [the exhibition] was only put on for 10 days. We brought a first edition of The Master and Margarita and a few important bits of paraphernalia. It was an announcement of the future of this space as a museum,” Peter Mansilla-Cruz, the director of the museum, told RBTH. \\nBulgakov lived in this apartment in the 1920s and 1930s and it is where he wrote his best-known work, The Master and Margarita . The novel recently was part of Google’s online reading project. \\n“The house where Bulgakov lived and worked is a memorial to our cultural heritage,” said Mansilla-Cruz, “behind its façade is a 19 th century mansion, which was rebuilt and reconstructed from top to bottom in the Soviet period. The apartment was occupied by yard and district services, and by lifters at the Housing Department, so it is suitably well-worn. It has been redesigned inside – the arch which led into his famous office has been re-laid with brick.” \\nBulgakov described the apartment in another of his works, Heart of a Dog . \\nFrom the exhibition “Manuscripts don’t burn” at Bolshaya Pirogovkaya St., 35A. Source: Moskva Agency \\nThe development of the museum’s concept and the restoration will continue into 2017, but Mansilla-Cruz says that the place will become a memorial space furnished with Bulgakov’s desk and other artifacts. “Luckily, many of his photos from that time have been preserved, so all the details can be restored.” \\nMoscow is already home to the State Bulgakov Museum. It is located near metro Mayakovskaya at 10 Bolshaya Sadovaya Street, the address at which Woland (Satan) and his entourage lived in The Master and Margarita .

You might remember it was John Morgan who hired former governor Charlie Crist ( Republican, then Independent, then Democrat ) after his failed Senate bid. John Morgan is also attached to the Multi-billion Pigford settlements via a partner in his law firm Greg Francis. \\nJohn Morgan is also a key donor , financial bundler, and contributor to President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Morgan has hosted numerous high-dollar ( $30k+ per plate ) events for Obama and this year f or Hillary Clinton . \\nLegalized marijuana sales in Florida, under the auspices and ruse of “medical marijuana”, has been a goal of Morgan for several years. Politically, Morgan also wants to be FL Attorney General and/or U.S Attorney General. \\nBy structuring a flawed ballot distribution in Broward County both Hillary Clinton and John Morgan can achieve both their objectives. A rather brilliant Win/Win. \\nThe scheme works by “accidentally” failing to print one of the pages in a strategic regional area guaranteed to be dominated by Clinton/Morgan supporters. It takes only a modicum of ‘ plausible deniability ‘ to provide the arms-length distance from a scheme. \\nSending out “some” or “a few” ballots with a blank page, a “flaw” per se’, then resending an entire second set of ballots (173,000) to the full area, provides multiple opportunities. \\nSee if you can spot how it plays out. Beginning with the small flaw: \\n( Miami Herald October 20th ) The Broward County elections office, already under scrutiny for two blunders in the past few weeks, played defense once more Friday as its supervisor came under fire after mail-in ballots turned up that skipped a constitutional amendment question on medical marijuana. \\nOne of the organizations supporting the amendment, NORML of Florida, has asked for an emergency hearing after filing a lawsuit on what it called an error that could be “catastrophic and cataclysmic.” A Broward judge has scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. Tuesday. \\n“In reviewing and reviewing and going back looking through our ballots we found Amendment 2 on all 92 of those styles so it’s still not totally clear why this voter did not have Amendment 2,” Snipes said. She added that she believes that the faulty ballots were test samples for Oakland Park. After a city candidate dropped out, she said, her office recoded the Oakland Park ballot, leading to a creation of a new test ballot. Her office did not notice the missing marijuana question on the test ballots, which are not supposed to be sent to voters but somehow were. \\nAt a maximum, Snipes said, only seven of those test ballots were printed. She allowed reporters, as well as a representative from United for Care, the political committee backing the amendment, to review the 92 ballot styles Friday. \\nBut amendment backers were skeptical of Snipes’ explanation after it became clear that she didn’t know precisely what went wrong or exactly how many ballots lack the closely watched amendment. Broward is the most left-leaning county in the state, and amendment backers are counting on its voters for a large share of support. \\n“What continues to concern me is it does not seem that the supervisor knows for certain the extent of the problem,” said Ben Pollara, campaign manager for United for Care. “They have a strongly held belief it is this very isolated incident [Snipes] described this afternoon but they don’t know for sure. Until they do I remain incredibly concerned.” ( read more including video and press conference) \\nOK, so that’s the ground work for the “small flaw” in Broward County ballots . Note in the video Ms. Brenda Snipes positioning 173,000 ballots as the full distribution to be concerned with. \\nNow lets look at what they finally claimed was the origin of the problem , and the solution they came up with : \\n( Via Sun Sentinel october 24th ) Broward elections workers checking mail-in ballots from Oakland Park found none without the statewide medical marijuana question that had been missing from at least two ballots. \\nBut an early voter at the Fort Lauderdale Regional Library/Art Serv said her ballot was missing Amendment 2. \\nThe Broward Supervisor of Elections Office said there was no evidence of a incorrect ballot. The pages were stuck together because of humidity in the machine, said spokeswoman Tonya Edwards. \\n“There was an issue with the humidity so it printed twice on one side instead of on the other,” Edwards said. “On one page it was blank and on the other page was the actual amendments.” \\nDebbi Ballard, 57, of Fort Lauderdale, said she filled out her ballot and realized the amendment wasn’t there. “I checked once, twice, three times,” she said. \\n“This is an irregularity and needs to be addressed,” Ballard said. She said she pointed out the error to voting staff and received a new ballot. \\nBallard said she was not satisfied with the “pages stuck together” theory and has lost confidence in Broward’s Supervisor of Elections Office. “That doesn’t explain it,” she said. “Because the layouts were completely different.” \\nBroward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes said there wasn’t an amendment issue. “It’s a moisture issue,” she said. “So I can understand why the voter, you know, became concerned or upset, because there’s been so much about it out there in the air. It’s a moisture issue, it’s a moisture issue.” \\nLast week, two voters in Oakland Park reported that the amendment had been left off their mail-in ballots. \\n[…] Snipes said that voters who are missing the amendment, all of whom should be in Oakland Park, will get new ballots . Edwards said later that Snipes was aware of the early voter’s issue.

       "  'Share on Twitter \\nWith premiums set to spike dramatically in 2017, MIT economist and so-called Obamacare “architect” Jonathan Gruber shared his big idea to fix the struggling health care law during an interview on CNN Wednesday. \\n“Once again, there’s no sense in which this has to be fixed. The law is working as designed, however it could work better,” Gruber said. “I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty.” \\nSo Gruber’s idea is to make it more expensive for people choosing to incur the “mandate penalty” in order to nudge them to enroll in Obamacare and take on higher premiums. The theory is that as more people enroll, the associated costs will go down. \\nYou might remember Gruber from a 2014 video in which he bragged about the Obama administration was able to take advantage of the “stupidity of the American voter” to get Obamacare passed. \\n“Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” he said in the video. “Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get anything to pass.” \\nOn several occasions, Gruber has been captured on video talking about exploiting American voters “lack of economic understanding.” \\nThe Obama administration admitted on Monday that Obamacare premiums for mid-level benchmark plans will increase by 25 percent on average across the country. Further, 20 percent of consumers will also have just one insurer to select from. \\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump has vowed to “repeal and replace” Obamacare with a new plan to provide ”great health care at a fraction of the cost.” He has offered few details on what that plan would entail. \\nHillary Clinton has promised to build on Obamacare and enact fixes rather than trashing the entire program.

       "  'Email Print The Democrats have become synonymous with the word scandal in this election. We have yet another scandal and reason to distrust Obama and Hillary Clinton—just for you. President Obama’s Justice Department has been caught red handed stealing money, which should be going to victims of crimes, and putting it into the hands of left-wing advocacy groups, as per Breitbart . This new scandal comes after we saw Hillary Clinton cleared of charges for acid washing her emails. This clearance came from the Justice Department, as run by a person who had private meetings with Bill Clinton prior to the decision. This also happened after Hillary Clinton said that if she was elected, she would reappoint the current attorney general—that same person—Loretta Lynch. The key facts of this news scandal are as follows: the Justice Department has millions of dollars of taxpayer money that is usually reserved for the victims of serious crimes. However, Obama has been funneling money, in the ballpark of $650 million, away from victims of serious crimes and towards organizations that are helping him. This money is supposed to be going to victims of federal crimes like gang violence, wall street corruption, or other white collar crimes. It’s normally used for restitution of the money the victims lost as a result of criminal actions. Is it surprising Obama thinks this money should be lining his pockets instead? Obama and his cronies find ways to make these left wing advocacy groups “victims” of crimes. These are organizations are signing people up to vote, going to rallies, knocking on doors, and helping elect Hillary Clinton—not advocacy groups that need restitution of money lost to criminals. Obama’s Justice Department has failed us once again. Instead of abusing taxpayer money, this Justice Department should be prosecuting Hillary Clinton for lying to Congress, destroying evidence after receiving a congressional subpoena, and obstructing justice. This is, alone, is enough to impeach the president, but we all know there simply isn’t enough time left in his presidency to do so. But, maybe we could get the paperwork rolling just to scare him a little bit! If elected, it is clear Hillary Clinton will continue these corrupt practices, especially with Loretta Lynch as her attorney general. The Justice Department especially will remain a pay-to-getaway operation. Do you think Obama’s scheme of funneling money is ethical?

       "  ' It Was the Rise of the Davos Class That Sealed America\\x92s Fate\\nHillary Clinton\\x92s embrace of neoliberalism was disastrous. The only answer now is to take on the billionaires\\nBy Naomi Klein\\nNovember 10, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" The Guardian \" - They will blame James Comey and the FBI. They will blame voter suppression and racism. They will blame Bernie or bust and misogyny. They will blame third parties and independent candidates. They will blame the corporate media for giving him the platform, social media for being a bullhorn, and WikiLeaks for airing the laundry.\\nBut this leaves out the force most responsible for creating the nightmare in which we now find ourselves wide awake: neoliberalism. That worldview \\x96 fully embodied by Hillary Clinton and her machine \\x96 is no match for Trump-style extremism. The decision to run one against the other is what sealed our fate. If we learn nothing else, can we please learn from that mistake?\\nHere is what we need to understand: a hell of a lot of people are in pain. Under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatisation, austerity and corporate trade, their living standards have declined precipitously. They have lost jobs. They have lost pensions. They have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening. They see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present.\\nAt the same time, they have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a hyper-connected network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cosy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous. Success is a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness.\\nFor the people who saw security and status as their birthright \\x96 and that means white men most of all \\x96 these losses are unbearable.\\nDonald Trump speaks directly to that pain. The Brexit campaign spoke to that pain. So do all of the rising far-right parties in Europe. They answer it with nostalgic nationalism and anger at remote economic bureaucracies \\x96 whether Washington, the North American free trade agreement the World Trade Organisation or the EU. And of course, they answer it by bashing immigrants and people of colour, vilifying Muslims, and degrading women. Elite neoliberalism has nothing to offer that pain, because neoliberalism unleashed the Davos class. People such as Hillary and Bill Clinton are the toast of the Davos party. In truth, they threw the party.\\nTrump\\x92s message was: \\x93All is hell.\\x94 Clinton answered: \\x93All is well.\\x94 But it\\x92s not well \\x96 far from it.\\nNeo-fascist responses to rampant insecurity and inequality are not going to go away. But what we know from the 1930s is that what it takes to do battle with fascism is a real left. A good chunk of Trump\\x92s support could be peeled away if there were a genuine redistributive agenda on the table. An agenda to take on the billionaire class with more than rhetoric, and use the money for a green new deal. Such a plan could create a tidal wave of well-paying unionised jobs, bring badly needed resources and opportunities to communities of colour, and insist that polluters should pay for workers to be retrained and fully included in this future. It could fashion policies that fight institutionalised racism, economic inequality and climate change at the same time. It could take on bad trade deals and police violence, and honour indigenous people as the original protectors of the land, water and air.\\nPeople have a right to be angry, and a powerful, intersectional left agenda can direct that anger where it belongs, while fighting for holistic solutions that will bring a frayed society together.\\nSuch a coalition is possible. In Canada, we have begun to cobble it together under the banner of a people\\x92s agenda called The Leap Manifesto , endorsed by more than 220 organisations from Greenpeace Canada to Black Lives Matter Toronto, and some of our largest trade unions.\\nBernie Sanders\\x92 amazing campaign went a long way towards building this sort of coalition, and demonstrated that the appetite for democratic socialism is out there. But early on, there was a failure in the campaign to connect with older black and Latino voters who are the demographic most abused by our current economic model. That failure prevented the campaign from reaching its full potential. Those mistakes can be corrected and a bold, transformative coalition is there to be built on.\\nThat is the task ahead. The Democratic party needs to be either decisively wrested from pro-corporate neoliberals, or it needs to be abandoned. From Elizabeth Warren to Nina Turner, to the Occupy alumni who took the Bernie campaign supernova, there is a stronger field of coalition-inspiring progressive leaders out there than at any point in my lifetime. We are \\x93leaderful\\x94, as many in the Movement for Black Lives say.\\nSo let\\x92s get out of shock as fast as we can and build the kind of radical movement that has a genuine answer to the hate and fear represented by the Trumps of this world. Let\\x92s set aside whatever is keeping us apart and start right now.\\nNaomi Klein is the author of This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate . She tweets @NaomiAKlein'],\n",

Image Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for AFI \\nAs Chris Queen of PJ Media points out in a piece posted there Wednesday, this isn\\'t the first time Dylan has failed to be on “the right side” of an issue— his pro-Israel stance has been irritating progressives forever. Image Credit: Koh Hasebe/Shinko Music/Getty Images \\nQueen cites a recent Al-Jazeera editorial written by French sociologist and media critic Ali Saad. \\nIn the article, Saad takes exception with much of the media for not pointing out Dylan\\'s pro-Israel political stance when reporting the news of his Nobel award. \\nSaad writes: \\n“....media outlets, both Arab and international, framed the story without taking issue with Dylan\\'s pro-Israel stance and instead portrayed him exclusively through the prism of his constructed image as defender of the oppressed.” \\nSaad also cites Dylan\\'s early \\'80s song “Neighborhood Bully,” whose lyrics supposedly express support of Israel metaphorically, as proof that Dylan has held that point of view for decades. \\nNaturally, since the majority of ultra-progressives tend to view Israel as an “occupying force” with an aggressive military, Saad sees it as unbecoming of an anti-war icon to pledge allegiance to such a state. Image Credit: Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images \\nOf course, more than a few were simply angry over Dylan\\'s refusal to acknowledge that he\\'d received the honor at all. The musician still hasn\\'t responded to the Nobel organization\\'s attempts to contact and congratulate him. \\nAs Ultimate Classic Rock writes: \\n\"Bob Dylan‘s decision to not acknowledge having won the Nobel Prize for Literature, unsurprisingly, isn’t sitting too well with the Swedish Academy, the body that awards the prize. Calling it \\'an unprecedented situation,\\' an academy member has lashed out at Dylan for ignoring their attempts to contact him. \\n\\'It’s impolite and arrogant,\\' Per Wastberg, a Swedish writer said on SVT public television, as reported by The Guardian. \\n\\'Yesterday, we reported that Dylan has rebuffed every attempt by the committee to contact him, either directly or through someone described as his “closest collaborator.” He even removed the acknowledgement of the prize from his website.

       "  \"AUDIO TAPE OF HILLARY LEAKED ABOUT RIGGING ELECTION 20.2K shares by DML DAILY / October 29, 2016 / CRAZY LEFT / According to the Observer , “On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.” Her conversation was secretly recorded. \\nThe audio was never released, and according to Chomsky it has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. He claims his copy is the only copy and no one has heard it since 2006. He gave a copy of the audio to the Observer. During the recording, Hillary is allegedly heard about rigging the election. She says: “I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” It shows she is willing to do whatever it takes to win. \\nChomsky told the Observer he was taken aback that “anyone could support the idea – offered by a national political leader, no less – that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.” The Observer is owned by Donald Trump’s son in law. \\nHere is the audio recording: \\nSign up to get alerts about Dennis Michael Lynch's upcoming Donald Trump film and breaking news.

       " ['Clinton campaign declines to support Dakota pipeline protesters',\n",
       "  'SHARES Hillary Clinton’s silence on the Dakota Access Pipeline has not gone unnoticed. On Thursday morning, young water protectors from Oceti Sakowin, the Seven Council Fires, and the Standing Rock Sioux Nation traveled to the Democratic presidential nominee’s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, demanding that she speak out against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The Hillary Clinton campaign has thus far remained silent about the 1,172-mile pipeline , which would cross both the Missouri River and the Ogallala Aquifer, threatening sacred indigenous land and water supplies. The group also called for solidarity actions at Clinton campaign offices across the country. “We are coming directly to Hillary at her headquarters because as the future president, she is going to have to work for us, and we want her to uphold the treaties and her promise to protect unci maka (Mother Earth),” said 19-year-old Gracey Claymore. Garret Hairychin, 23, echoed Claymore’s concerns. “As a young person I want to know what the next four years are going to entail. Is Hillary going to be focused on protecting our land? I want to know if my younger family is going to be safe. Our present situation is in dire need of a leader that still remembers that our kids are here,” Hairychin said. “We want to protect the future for the young ones that come after us. I’m here to support my family.” The youth delegation took over the lobby of the campaign HQ with a full-size tipi to deliver their message to Clinton. Despite the size and energy of the demonstration, Clinton campaign staffers refused to even accept the letter indigenous protesters had for the former Secretary of State. \\nWATCH: Anti-Dakota Access pipeline protesters marching to Clinton campaign headquarters in Brooklyn to demand that she… \\nPosted by NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt on Thursday, October 27, 2016 The delegation included four of the Oceti Sakowin youth runners, a group of young people who ran over 1,600 miles from North Dakota to Washington, DC earlier this year to pray for the water, raise awareness, and deliver 140,000 petition signatures to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. One of the runners, 18-year-old Adam Palaniuk Killsalive, said those thousands of miles should mean something. “We are here to tell Hillary how badly we need to protect the water. We didn’t come all the way to New York for nothing. We didn’t run all the way to Omaha or DC for nothing,” Killsalive said. “We want to ask Hillary if she wants to see her great-grandkids line up for water rations.” A large and growing community led by indigenous groups has come together in rejecting the DAPL, with thousands gathering at a series of encampments on the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux to resist the pipeline’s construction. Hundreds of peaceful protectors, including children, have been pepper sprayed, attacked by dogs, and arrested by private security forces and state law enforcement. American Indians from over 300 tribes have joined in solidarity, as have 21 city and county governments. Clinton’s silence grows increasingly conspicuous as more and more of her peers speak out against the project. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), former Vice President Al Gore , and U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva (D-Arizona) have all condemned the DAPL and called for an end to its construction. Lilian Molina, a spokesperson for Greenpeace, agreed that the total silence from both Hillary Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump is a major cause for concern. “Silence is not acceptable. Waiting is not acceptable,” Molina said. “We are grateful for the young people who have traveled so far to say enough is enough. If you claim to be a climate champion, that means respecting Indigenous sovereignty, rejecting new pipelines, and keeping dangerous fossil fuels in the ground.” 16-year-old William Brownotter, another member of the youth delegation, pointed out that the DAPL isn’t just a new threat, but a continuation of centuries of disenfranchisement and theft from Native Americans. “We made treaties and agreements. A violation of a native treaty is a violation of federal law,” said Brownotter. “By refusing to stand against DAPL, Hillary is putting our environment, wildlife, culture, and land at risk.” The DAPL, which would cross unceded Indigenous territory, is a direct violation of the sovereign rights and culture of the Standing Rock Sioux. The fast-track process of approval disregarded key U.S. legislation, including the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. No proper environmental impact study was performed , and no consultation was sought from the indigenous community. In a letter presented to Clinton , water protectors wrote that as the possible next president, it’s on the former Secretary of State to stop the pipeline and protect valuable natural resources. “As we look into the coming days and months, we are prepared to continue to stand for the rights of our people and Mother Earth. As President Obama rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline, we urge the new President to be a leader and continue standing up for what is right by rejecting the Dakota Access Pipeline,” The letter states. “The First 100 Days is a significant time for you to set the stage – are you with us? “ \\nWhile water protectors protested at the Clinton campaign headquarters, militarized police moved in on the Standing Rock camp, deploying sonic weapons, destroying prayer tents, and arresting observers in an effort to force water protectors off the land. As of this writing, Hillary Clinton has not made any statements against the Dakota Access Pipeline. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

       "  \"Exhausted, Defeated Voters Finally Beginning To Relate To Hillary Clinton Close Vol 52 Issue 44 · Politics · Politicians · Hillary Clinton · Election 2016 \\nWASHINGTON—Explaining that they have finally started to feel a connection with the Democratic Party nominee, millions of defeated and utterly exhausted voters admitted to reporters Wednesday they are now starting to relate to Hillary Clinton. “I never thought I had much in common with her before, but after waking up today feeling so drained and beaten, I think I’m beginning to see that she and I really are a lot alike,” said 34-year-old Chicago resident Anthony Pallister, echoing the sentiments of Americans across the country who claimed that over the course of the last 24 hours, the feeling that they had suffered through a long, wearying ordeal only to be summarily rejected had caused them to notice many similarities between themselves and the 69-year-old presidential candidate. “The more I think about how dejected and overcome I feel, the more I begin to see myself and my viewpoints in Hillary Clinton. In fact, I don’t know the last time I’ve related to a candidate this much.” Many Americans went on to confirm that their perception of Hillary Clinton being completely out of touch with the majority of the country has now made the former secretary of state far more likable.

       " ['Obama’s “Swang Trip” to Europe is No Reason for Tears | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Europe Obama’s final tour to Europe in the capacity of US President has been a milestone event from various points of view. He has come as the representative of the losing side that would still try to reassure its European allies that America’s polic ies toward s Europe and NATO will not undergo any significant changes d uring Trump’s term. However, against the background of the turmoil in the EU political establishment, as the declining influence of Washington is aggravating internal feud in the EU corridors of power those promises fall flat. Moreover, Greece’s public debt stands at roughly 180 percent of gross domestic product with 330 billion euro to be found somewhere by the “rescue team” of international creditors. The recent elections in Bulgaria and Moldova have stirred bitter accusations and pessimistic forecasts, as the sitting EU officials are convinced that the politicians that came to power in the above mentioned states are pro-Russian by their nature. That’s why Obama has been desperately trying to calm down local pessimists by saying that anti-Russian sanctions will be kept in place and that the Iran nuclear program nuclear deal is not going anywhere. It’s funny that Trump has already promised to do otherwise and Obama will have no say on this matter whatsoever in a short while. When Obama’s tour to Europe was announced, the White House assumed it could be launched without any prior announcements that Obama was to meet Francois Hollande and Theresa May in Berlin. The announcement would only state that US President is going to visit the cradle of democracy (Greece) and Europe’s driving economic engine (Germany). The French Le Figaro would publish a pretty bitter article, noting that France is a UN Security Council permanent members, yet its leader is being ordered around to follow Obama as if he was a courier in his entourage. It goes without saying that Italian and Spanish leaders are receiving the same treatment from America’s lame duck. It doesn’t seem that the way Washington is treating Hollande will help the latter to get reelected. It seems that US political elites are convinced that Merkel has overshadowed Hollande and now she’s the only one to be treated with respect. The Foreign Policy would note : On what is his last tour of Europe this week, and what is likely to be his last major tour abroad, outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama has reserved a full two days for Berlin. This unusually long visit to the German capital is not a coincidence. It is here that he first became a figure of «global importance» when, in July 2008, the then-candidate mesmerized a crowd of 200,000 Berliners. It is here that he developed his strongest rapport with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Most importantly, however, it is here that his foreign-policy legacy now has its strongest, if not last, line of defens e However, if Obama is such a fan of German Chancellor, how come the NSA and CIA have been tapping her phones for years. The scandal that outraged all sides of the German political spectrum was downplayed by Merkel back in 2015 in her bid to show her “unparalleled loyalty” to Washington and its masters. This position allowed the Obama administration to become the unannounced champions of law suits against German companies, that resulted in major settlements with Deutsche Bank paying 14 billion dollars to Washington, and Volkswagen parting away with 15 billion dollars. Therefore, it’s hardly surprising that no genuine tears were shed when Obama was visiting Greece, even though Western corporate media sources heralded the trip as a “major political event”. However, Greeks had an opinion of their own on this matter, launching massive anti-US protests in the Greek capital to “honor” Obama. In the end, local riot police was forced to use tear gas to get the situation under their control. A similar reception awaited Obama in Germany, but here he was not the only one to be envied, since Merkel is losing public support so rapidly due to her toothless position that most local politicians would try to avoid being mentioned in one sentence with the Chancellor at all costs. During his visit Obam would urge leaders of the European Union to be more forgiving of Greece and its debts. However, as the Bloomberg says , it’s long past time for Europe’s leaders to explain to their voters that financial distress is best dealt with decisively, not dragged out in perpetuity — and that prompt debt relief is in their interests as well as Greece’s. A continued policy of extend and pretend will cripple Greece’s prospects, and if that happens, the economic and political costs won’t be confined to Greece. It’s curious that Trump’s victory has turned a trip that was originally intended to showcase Mr Obama’s foreign policy legacy into a US damage limitation exercise. Yet, bitterness is the best word to describe the reaction in Europe towards Obama’s statements during this trip. It’s being noted that the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the king of drones has done nothing to make this world a better or safer place. American troops are in Afghanistan, while the prisoners are still being tortured at Guantanamo Bay, the Middle East as a region is going down in flames and the Ukraine is now governed by fascists. That’s how Obama’s presidency will be remembered by. Yes, there are tears, tears of bitterness and anger! Nobody is saddened by the fact that Obama leaves the White House, but millions of people are frustrated by the fact that Obama would still be allowed to the world of international politics!

       "  \"Nate Silver Gunned Down Attempting To Cross Mexican Border With All 2016 Polling Data Authorities say Silver’s body was found facedown still clutching onto several dozen Marist College surveys. Close Authorities say Silver’s body was found facedown still clutching onto several dozen Marist College surveys. NEWS November 4, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 43 · News · Election 2016 \\nEL PASO, TX—Saying they were forced to use lethal force after the statistician and FiveThirtyEight founder attempted to breach a secure checkpoint, United States Border Patrol agents confirmed Friday that Nate Silver was gunned down while trying to cross into Mexico with all the polling data from the 2016 general election. \\nA government spokesperson stated that the 38-year-old political blogger, who presented a patrolman at the border crossing with a doctored U.S. passport listing his name as Rafael Ignacio Salvador, reportedly appeared agitated and nervous when responding to simple questions, resulting in his being flagged for further screening and apparently prompting his decision to flee. Silver is said to have rammed his vehicle into a patrol car during his attempt to evade authorities before trying to escape on foot with as many national and state-level opinion polls as he could carry, at which time he was shot repeatedly by multiple officers. \\nSilver was pronounced dead at the scene shortly thereafter. \\n“Upon initial contact, border agents found Mr. Silver to be acting erratically and noticed what appeared to be a large quantity of materials concealed under a blanket in his backseat,” said Division Chief David Stefans. “When instructed to pull his vehicle to the side for further inspection, Silver abruptly accelerated forward and crashed through a barrier, leaving agents with no choice but to discharge their weapons. A subsequent search of the scene yielded over 20 months’ worth of surveys of likely voters, election models, and long-term electoral forecasts concealed in numerous places throughout the vehicle.” \\n“We can verify at this time that Mr. Silver was in possession of every piece of U.S. polling information dating back to last spring when he attempted to flee the country,” Stefans added. \\nOfficials stated that in addition to the thousands of presidential election polls found strewn about Silver’s 1984 Oldsmobile 98 following the incident, investigators discovered hundreds of weighted congressional forecasts hidden within the car’s wheel wells. The entirety of Silver’s polls-only and polls-plus forecasts since the beginning of the primaries were also reportedly discovered inside the car’s hollowed-out speaker system. \\n“After he sideswiped a barricade, his trunk popped open, and all these Zogby and Pew surveys came flying out all over the road,” said long-haul trucker Ernesto Nunez, who described watching Silver struggle out of his wrecked vehicle still clutching an armful of high-sample-size phone and online opinion polls. “Even after they struck him a couple times, you could see he was still trying to hold onto as many A-plus–rated surveys as he could.” \\n“He might have made it, too, if he’d just dumped all the Monmouth University tracking polls on the ground and made a quick break for the Rio Grande,” Nunez added. \\nAccording to authorities, a posthumous search of Silver’s person also found a stash of bullet-ridden Ciruli Associates and ABC News/Washington Post polls duct-taped to his legs and abdomen. While officials refused to speculate on the matter, they noted that an autopsy would be conducted in the next several days to determine if the statistician had ingested any further polling data or secreted it in any of his orifices for transport across the border. \\n“We thought we’d removed every poll from the vehicle after we pried open the glove compartment and found all the Rasmussens he’d stuffed under there, but then we cut open the upholstery of the seats and realized he’d packed them full of swing state demographic analyses,” said Border Patrol agent Paul Vasquez. “It wasn’t until we had the K-9 unit go through the vehicle that we discovered Silver was actually using a false bottom under the car’s chassis to smuggle every candidate favorability rating since Ted Cruz announced he was running for the presidency. This guy was thorough.” \\n“We hate to use deadly force, but we’re incredibly lucky we stopped him when we did,” Vasquez continued. “Mr. Silver could have left our country with absolutely no polling numbers, no electoral projections, and no approval ratings just days before the election.” Share This Story: Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter \\nGive your spam filter something to do.

       " ['Does Obama have a Brilliant Career Ahead of Him? | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World Even though The American Spectator has claimed that “Obama and his crew will soon be swept into the dustbin of history”, the future of “America’s lame duck” still draws a lot of media attention. Some commentators, especially those that have been handsomely paid by the White House, are trying to somehow improve the public image of the still sitting US president who has discredited himself in a number of ways over the last 8 years, especially in such fields as “ combating ” racism in the United States and Washington’s military interventions across the globe. The New York Times would note that with less than three months left for his presidency, Barack Obama is preparing for a life after the White House that would most likely include a close relationship with Silicon Valley. As an explanation for such a statement, the newspaper provides the report on how interested President Obama was in the Dragon spacecraft built by SpaceX. President Obama even tested a program that stimulates docking the spacecraft with the International Space Station. This area of Obama’s possible interests is cited by a great many commentators as his future occupation, which seems logical since Obama’s “contribution” to US military contractors regarding profits has been paramount all throughout his years in office. However, there’s reports that Obama has diverse musical interests as well. Reportedly, his favorite music genre is soul. He listens to various artists that developed this genre, but his absolute favorite is Stevie Wonder and his “My Cherie Amour”, “All In Love Is Fair”, “For Once in My Life”, and “I Just Called to Say I Love You”. These songs can always be found in the playlist of the current American leader. Barack Obama is also found of Al Green and his vocal prowess. He tends to enjoy such saxophonists as Lester Young, John Coltrane, and Coleman Hawkins. As for rock legends, Obama prefers to listen to the legendary The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. As for the latest hits, Barack Obama has been enjoying the Canadian indie rockers Arcade Fire with their “We Used to Wait”, and the British indie-pop band Florence & The Machine with their hit “You’ve Got The Love”. As a real American president, Barack Obama just can not help but love country music as well, as he frequently listens to such bands as Zac Brown and Montgomery Gentry. So some musicians, especially in the US, have been advising Obama to switch to musical activities, perhaps playing in a banjo in a band. – It seems that it might be a good pastime for Obama after his “toying with soldiers” in the Middle East and other regions of the world. A lot of comments in various media can be found about Obama’s ties with hospitals, and Doctors Without Borders in particular. Tens of hospital have been wiped off the face of the earth and hundreds of doctors and their patients died as a result of the strikes in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and elsewhere in the world authorized by Obama. Therefore, it seems unlikely that any hospital run by Doctors Without Borders will have the courage to turn Obama’s application down after the termination of his presidential mandate. Especially when you consider that the risk of dying under US bombs will diminish for most of its employees after January 2017. However, if the White House is then occupied by Hillary Clinton, Obama may be running the risk of coming under friendly fire if working in one of such hospitals, an irony considering his endorsement of Clinton. But the most important thing by far is that Obama will no longer be making America’s decisions, since during his time doing so, he has got the US mired in five overseas wars simultaneously , subjecting millions of innocent civilians in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia to intolerable suffering, loss of shelter and families, and forced refuge in foreign lands. Therefore, the choice of a decent successor to the current lame duck president should be way more important than supporting the war party and Obama’s spiritual successor – Hillary Clinton.

       " ['Trump And The Balkans | Katehon think tank. Geopolitics & Tradition',\n",
       "  'Andrew Korybko \\nThere’s a lot of talk in the Balkans about what sort of a leader Trump will be and how his foreign policy will impact on the region. Although he was only just elected last week and still has over two months to go before officially coming to power, it’s already possible to make some predictions in attempting to answer those questions. Greeks In Government \\nThe strongest indication yet about what Trump’s Balkan policy may look like comes from the appointment of Reince Priebus as his Chief of Staff. This prestigious and high-profile position will be occupied by a Greek Orthodox believer who was born to a Greek mother, so it can confidently be inferred that he has a strong sense of Greek identity which obviously plays to the Republic of Macedonia’s disadvantage vis-à-vis the name issue and other matters of mutual discord. The second factor playing in Greece’s favor is the fact that Stephen K. Bannon was appointed at the same time as Trump’s Chief Strategist. This is important because Bannon used to run the wildly successful alternative media outlet Breitbart just prior to taking on his mid-summer responsibilities as the CEO of Trump’s campaign. One of the most popular writers on the site is Milo Yiannopoulos, an outspoken homosexual of Greek descent and someone who is not at all expected to be friendly to Macedonia or its culture of conservative values. Given Breitbart’s closeness to the Trump Administration, writers such as Milo might exert a disproportionate influence on the President’s policy formulation. Soros And Macedonia \\nNeither Priebus, Bannon, nor Yiannopoulos are good for Macedonia, but on the other hand, the Trump team’s antipathy to Color Revolution financier George Soros is well known and could play to the country’s advantage. It’s too early to tell, but with Soros practically declaring war on Trump and reorienting his focus towards the US and away from other parts of the world (at least for now), there’s a chance that the NGO-driven Color Revolution tumult of approximately the last two years might finally be over for some time. It’s also possible that Trump and his “deep state” (the military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies) might even defeat Soros and remove him from power, thus rendering his networks null and void for some time. \\nIn such a case, this wouldn’t necessarily mean the end of NGO-driven Hybrid War , but just that someone else might be tasked by the administration to replace him and take over his worldwide network. The visible change that this could produce would be that the message that future “Soros”-connected organizations propagate in trying to gain more regime change recruits could decisively shift from the “far left” to the “far right”, especially if Trump’s CIA realizes that it’s a lot more effective to use this sort of narrative in exploiting the palpable zeitgeist than stubbornly sticking with a discredited and proven failure from the past. It’s still too early to tell if this will happen or not, but the scenario isn’t improbable and should at the very least be countenanced by all Macedonians seeking to predict the course of American policy towards their country. \\nIf one accounts for the influence that Greeks will have on the Trump Presidency and acknowledge that Soros might very well end up on the losing side in his War on Trump, then it’s possible to forecast that the new American leader probably won’t budge on the name issue, yet won’t be as predisposed to resort to the same type of asymmetrical aggressions against Macedonia as his predecessor did. In short, Trump would be more reasonable than Obama, though he would still lean towards Greece if forced to choose. This is very relevant in terms of the bigger Balkan picture because it’s likely that the businessman will engage in his trademark deal-making in trying to reach a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with Russia over establishing spheres of influence, and there’s no way that the Balkans would be left out of this proposal. Spheres Of Influence The Greek Headquarters: \\nThe US will never peacefully cede its prevailing influence over any of the NATO states, so nobody should get their hopes up that this will happen under Trump. Greece will probably be the center point of the new administration’s Balkan policy due to its energy significance with Balkan Stream, the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, and the future potential that it has for transiting Israeli gas from the Eastern Mediterranean Leviathan field to the EU. Moreover, Greece is regularly at odds with Turkey due to the latter’s aggressive airspace violations in the eastern Aegean Sea, and the fierce opposition that all Greeks have to Turkish President Erdogan means that the country could become a useful base for covert destabilization operations against the multipolar-leaning leader who just barely survived a recent US coup against him. The ‘Coastal Balkans’ vs The ‘Balkan Bubble’: \\nAs for the rest of the Balkans, it was already expressed that the US will never “hand over” any of the NATO states to Russia, so this essentially leaves just the non-NATO states as potentially falling under any prospective spheres of influence agreement with Russia. Therefore, only Bosnia, Serbia, and the Republic of Macedonia could conceivably play a part in this proposal. It’s not likely that the Croat-Muslim Federation part of Bosnia would agree to their entire country being aligned with Moscow, so it’s much more realistic that only Republika Srpska – which already enjoys close political-strategic relations with Russia – would be party to this tacit agreement. Serbia, too, would thus obviously be involved as well, as could the Republic of Macedonia, though the latter might once more find itself on the frontlines of competition seeing as how influential some Greeks are poised to become in the Trump Administration. \\nIf one looks at it from a structural standpoint, it’s clear to see that the ‘Coastal Balkans’ would predictably come under the US’ influence, while Russia only stands to gain footing in the ‘Balkan Bubble’ of the Central Balkans, though importantly the most pivotal part of the region through which it and China’s megaprojects will pass. Balkan Stream could enter the Republic of Macedonia and thenceforth Serbia from Greece, which in this case would still give the US some degree of leverage over the project, but only up until the Greek-Macedonian border. Moreover, the Greek government has shown that it isn’t too loyal to anyone and just goes wherever the money is, so even with pro-Greek lobbyists in the Trump Administration, there’s no guarantee that Athens will agree to ‘cut its nose to spite its face’ in interfering with the Russian pipeline just for the sake of satisfying a few members of its American-based diaspora. Money talks, and Balkan Stream will be very profitable for the economically challenged country, so it probably won’t disrupt the project and sacrifice the billions of dollars of transit fees that it stands to gain from it. Macedonia In The Middle: \\nThe Macedonian government, unlike its Greek counterpart, has consistently proven itself to be a reliable partner and does not have a history of waffling between foreign patrons for the sake of pecuniary interests. Whether it’s in building strong relations with its existing Western partners or exploring deeper avenues of cooperation with its newer Russian and Chinese ones, nothing negative is really expected to change no matter whose sphere of influence Macedonia ultimately falls under. However, due to the tumultuous regime change attempts of the past couple of years which were sponsored and engineered by the US and a few other Western countries, there’s a reasonable chance that Macedonia might responsibly ‘hedge its bets’ by moving closer to the East in response, especially when bearing in mind that the West has constantly rejected its EU and NATO applications by strongly siding with Greece in the unresolved naming dispute. In fact, by virtue of Macedonia not being in either of these two organizations, it would automatically be more likely to enter into the Russian/multipolar sphere of influence if Trump is able to clinch a related agreement with Putin. Serbia And Republika Srpska: \\nAs for Serbia, the country’s people are overwhelmingly favorable towards Russia in spite of the Vucic government’s innate pro-Western orientation and clumsy façade of “geopolitical balancing”. Nevertheless, once more the “Balkan Bubble” of non-EU and non-NATO states comes into relevance and thus plays to Russia’s favor, increasing the probability that this country will also be “safely allowed” by the US to embrace Moscow just a little bit more substantially than it is now. That being said, Vucic isn’t a trustworthy or reliable partner , so instead of taking advantage of this just like how Macedonia and Republika Srpska will expectedly do by enhancing full-spectrum relations with Russia, the Serbian leader might just blow the opportunity by stubbornly sticking to his “geopolitical balancing” ruse in making symbolic gestures towards Russia while still deepening his country’s substantial partnerships with the West. In this sense, Republika Srpska’s President Dodik could be a better representation of the Serbian people’s will than the Prime Minister of Serbia proper is, since this subnational leader is more likely to take advantage of being part of any future Russian sphere of influence that Vucic is. Popping The ‘Balkan Bubble’ \\nFor as much of a win-win agreement as the enumerated spheres of interest proposal could be, there’s a lot that could go wrong in popping Russia’s ‘Balkan Bubble’, not least of which is the fact that it might not even happen at all if Trump isn’t able to replace and/or co-opt some of the neoconservatives embedded in the American “deep state”. Assuming that he’s able to do so to a workable extent whereby he’s empowered to carry through on his projected spheres of influence plan, then there’s always the chance that the US might just backstab Russia by activating the same geostrategic ticking time bombs that have threatened the Balkans for the past couple of years, such as a resumption of civil hostilities in Bosnia and a return to Albanian terrorism against Serbia and Macedonia. \\nWorse still, Trump might not even know about these or be able to fully stop them if they’re orchestrated by rogue neoconservative elements which were ‘cleansed’/’purged’ from the “deep state” and have ordered their loyal international contacts to take revenge by sabotaging the Trump-Putin ‘gentleman’s agreement’ over spheres of influence in Europe. Soros and his sympathizers could also do something similar, especially since the billionaire will probably fall out of favor with the US government during Trump’s term and might be motivated to partake in similar geopolitical vengefulness. Of course, Trump might also just be bluffing with Putin and trying to reach an agreement in order to buy time before preparing a ‘final strike’ against the last vestiges of multipolarity in the continent, but that doesn’t seem too probable since he’s more of a level-headed and stable businessman than a risky “deep state” gambler like Obama is. Concluding Thoughts \\nTrump has a track record of reaching deals and keeping his word, and given the positive chemistry that he’s already displayed towards Putin following their first-ever phone conversation with one another, observers can expect that the President-elect would probably stay true to any future promises that he makes to his Russian counterpart and consequently abide by any ‘gentleman’s agreement’ that he reaches over establishing a stable sphere of influence between them in ushering in a period of New Cold War Détente. While the proposed delineation might suggest that Russia doesn’t have anything to gain from the ‘Balkan Bubble’, such a conclusion would be both naïve and premature, since Moscow does in fact have a lot of geostrategic interests in the Central Balkans which it wants to use as the basis for building full-spectrum and robust partnerships with its members. \\nShould the predicted period of Détente last, then there’s nothing standing in the way of Russia or any of its forecasted partners reaching these sorts of mutually beneficial partnerships since the US would be disinclined to object to them so long as it keeps its word in respecting the Trump-Putin deal. This can’t be fully guaranteed no matter how convincingly it appears that it would last, but it would at the very least provide a valuable window of opportunity for both sides to intensify their relations. What’s ultimately most important is that Trump takes the US’ eyes off of the Balkans and stops trying to destabilize them like Obama did, since this could buy enough time for China’s Balkan Silk Road high-speed rail project to be constructed and thus open up an invigorating multipolar economic corridor between the Central European capital of Budapest and the Mediterranean port of Piraeus by means of the ‘Balkan Bubble’ states of Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia. \\nRussia should by that time have made itself comfortable in the ‘Balkan Bubble’ and could thus diversify its existing infrastructural and energy investments by expanding them into more of the real-sector economy, building off of the advantages that the Balkan Silk Road will provide in dramatically facilitating the logistical ease of conducting commercial business in the region. It might be optimistic to hope for so early at this point and two months before Trump even formally enters into power, but there’s a very real chance that the consummate outsider will indeed shake up the neoconservative-led and Soros-influenced US foreign policy establishment and carry through on his promises to normalize relations with Russia and repair some of the global destabilization wrought by the Obama years. \\nThis in turn could only work out to the Balkans’ benefit, especially if the man who wrote “The Art Of The Deal” practices what he preached and reaches a monumental one with Putin to decide upon a stable sphere of influence in the region, though there’s still a lot that can go wrong to prevent this from happening or sabotage it if it proves to be “too successful”. \\n'],\n",

The US election result has convinced many Britons they are dreaming but something even more bizarre and implausible will happen soon and make them wake up. Office worker Tom Logan said: “Trump’s the president apparently, so I expect some proper dream weirdness will happen soon, like being chased through Asda by a cyberman. “It’s an odd dream though because I’m at work and it’s all very detailed, almost like real life. Still, at least I’m not naked or I’ve got some stressful task to do that’s really illogical. “I’m sure any minute now I’ll be able to laugh at this whole Trump business when Holly Willoughby turns up and takes me for a sexy ride in her helicopter.” Accountant Donna Sheridan said: “This is a long dream but nothing totally incongruous has happened yet like taking my childhood dog to get his nails clipped by Coldplay’s Chris Martin. “Trump can’t have won the election though because that’s insane. Frankly I’ll feel better if it turns into a proper nightmare where I’m being made to re-sit my A-levels by a witch. “He hasn’t won, has he?

       "  'Prev post Page 1 of 5 Next \\nDo Doctors Treat Women’s Pain Less Seriously Than Men? There is recent evidence showing women treated differently for similar symptoms. The Yentl Syndrome \\nSometimes movies can have an impact in ways nobody who wrote or worked on the movie could possibly imagine. \\nIn the 1983 film “Yentl”, Barbara Streisand’s character plays the role of a male in order to receive the education she wants. Dr. Bernadine Healy used the phrase “Yentl Syndrome” in an academic paper eight years after the film was released. She used it to describe how many women died because they were misdiagnosed because their symptoms were different than men. \\nToday the term Yentl Syndrome is widely used as a description of how women are more likely to be treated less aggressively than men. This is primarily because medical research has focused on the symptoms of male heart attacks, and many women have different symptoms. \\nThe term Yentl Syndrome has also been used in a wider context of how because women experience pain differently than men, many healthcare providers do not take the pain of a woman as seriously as they do a man. Prove You Are As Sick as a Male Patient \\nIn initial encounters with the health-care system, women are more likely to be treated less aggressively than men until they “prove that they are as sick as male patients”, according to a study entitled “The Girl Who Cried Pain,”. A contributing factor is that most emergency rooms in the United States do not have an attending OB-GYN. \\nWomen were less likely to receive aggressive treatment when diagnosed, and were more likely to have their pain characterized as “emotional” or “psychogenic” and therefore “not real” according to the study. \\nThese misplaced characterizations can lead to treatment for mental health issues that might not even exist in the patient. Then the situation is further complicated because antidepressants are absorbed differently in women and may have different levels of effectiveness.

       "  \"Share on Twitter \\nDuring the third and final presidential debate, Donald Trump gave a fairly graphic description of what happens during a partial-birth abortion. Hillary Clinton was quick to say that — basically — Trump was full of it, and that procedure “isn't what happens at all.” \\nBut the National Right to Life describes the procedure in vivid detail: \\nPartial-Birth Abortion is a procedure in which the abortionist pulls a living baby feet-first out of the womb and into the birth canal (vagina), except for the head, which the abortionist purposely keeps lodged just inside the cervix (the opening to the womb). The abortionist punctures the base of the baby’s skull with a surgical instrument, such as a long surgical scissors or a pointed hollow metal tube called a trochar. He then inserts a catheter (tube) into the wound, and removes the baby's brain with a powerful suction machine. This causes the skull to collapse, after which the abortionist completes the delivery of the now-dead baby. \\nAnd the exact same procedure was detailed in the 1996 ban on partial-birth abortion that was vetoed by Bill Clinton. A similar ban was later passed again by Congress, and was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2003. \\nFollowing the debate, in defense of Hillary Clinton, late-night host Samantha Bee (“Full Frontal with Samantha Bee”) doubled down on Clinton's position, saying that partial-birth abortion “isn't a thing”: Image Credit: YouTube \\nBut just a few seconds later, she offers a back-handed admission that partial-birth abortion is a thing after all, it's just a thing that was banned in 2003: Image Credit: YouTube \\nBee went on to cheer Hillary for being the...: \\n“...passionate and unapologetic feminist we haven't seen since the 90s. One who stood in a shower of sh*t and managed to do what 16 primary candidates and the GOP establishment couldn't: Namely, beat this d**k-waving, Berlusconi knock-off like a little bitch.” \\nEnter radio host Steven Crowder (“Louder with Crowder”)... \\nIn a video response to Bee's post-debate diatribe, Crowder pointed out that not only does the procedure exist [warning: his descriptions are exceptionally graphic], but that Hillary Clinton did, in fact, vote against banning it in the Senate in 2003: \\nCrowder deftly took on Bee's argument with a jab: \\n“Oh, this is the part where we condemn white men for having an opinion on murder...” \\nA cross: \\n“A 'fatal birth defect.' Does that mean a baby who would be dead on arrival, or does it mean any baby that might have a disability and so the parents don't want to go through the trouble of raising that child?” \\nAnd a Chuck Norris-caliber roundhouse kick: \\n“Health of the mother? Anything can be filed under 'health.' And they have — including anxiety disorders, slight irritability, or not wanting to go to prom [pregnant].” \\nCrowder also went on to examine the typical liberal defense of abortion, systematically dismantling arguments that protect abortion in the name of “freedom” and “women's health.” \"],\n",

       "  'Email Print Donald Trump is reportedly firing around 500 of Barack Obama’s staffers, as he plans to completely fill the White House with his own team. The Federalist Papers reported that though it’s likely that Hillary Clinton would have let most of Obama’s people go so that she could hire her own staff, Trump’s win closed the door on the possibility of any of Obama’s staffer sticking around. The fired staffers have gotten so desperate about their employment situation that Obama has brought in representatives from Facebook, Instagram and other companies to offer insights into the job market. According to CBS News , Linkedin officials are helping Obama’s staff find ways to market their skills. Georgetown University, which is located close to the White House, has designed a custom professional development program they call “Future44,” Obama is the 44th president, to teach Obama’s political appointees how to build their lives after the White House. The program is free of charge thanks to an anonymous donor, and participants register for either four 2-hour evening sessions or one 8-hour “boot camp.” “We designed this unique curriculum to help these staffers think through how to market themselves or market their competencies,” said Kelly Otter, dean of Georgetown’s School of Continuing Studies. Many of Obama’s staffers will likely end up in liberal cities like New York or San Francisco working for companies that cater to millennials such as Amazon, Snapchat, Google, Vice, etc. “The transition out of government is a reality for most appointees, which brings both excitement about prospects for the next chapter or a long-awaited chance to recharge batteries, and a keen awareness about a big, impending change,” said White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman. Ivan Adler, a headhunter at McCormick Group, explained that Obama’s staffers are about to face a major change in life that may be hard to get through. “I tell everybody: You have to understand there’s likely nothing you will do professionally that will have the same amount of excitement you’ve just gone through in the White House, unless you become a racecar driver or an astronaut,” he said.

She was determined to latch on to her high approval ratings and lay the foundation for a second presidential run. That’s when Anthony D. Weiner happened. The husband of Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, was running for mayor of New York when it was revealed that he had continued to exchange lewd messages with women online even after the practice cost him his congressional seat. The incident brought Abedin’s relationship with Clinton into the spotlight, and Clinton was once again making headlines for sexual indiscretions. Now, just weeks away from the election, Weiner has pulled her into yet another one of his dramas. Federal investigators are looking into his sexual messaging with an underage girls, and they just happened to stumble across thousands of emails that are potentially pertinent to the FBI investigation of Clinton’s private email server. This was disturbing for many reasons. Americans are not happy that the Clintons have a continued behavior of standing behind those who have committed dangerous sexual or financial acts. That doesn’t align well with Hillary’s message about empowering women. In fact, many of Clinton’s friends have suggested she distance herself from Abedin. Still, she kept Abedin close by her side as she prepared to make a statement about the new revelation to the media. “We of course stand by her,” her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, said on Saturday when he was asked whether Abedin would step down. The question on many Americans’ minds now is whether Clinton’s loyalty to Abedin would inspire her to bring her friend (and her drama) into the White House if she wins the presidency.

       " ['Turkey and the Next War      : Information',\n",
       "  ' Turkey and the Next War By Philip Giraldi\\n The Republic of Turkey has become a loose cannon on deck, a short-term asset in enabling the United States (US) bombing of northern Syria but a major liability when it comes to any eventual settlement intended to quell the fighting in the region.\\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking to destroy both genuine enemies and far less blameworthy critics alike in his over-the-top reaction to July\\x92s attempted military coup. His emergency powers were recently extended. He has used an enemies list, prepared pre-coup, to detain 37,000 without any prospect of trial, to arrest or fire more than 1,00,000 government officials, to shut down newspapers and television stations, to close schools and universities and to wage an increasingly bloody war against the country\\x92s minority, Kurds.\\nIn Kurdish southwestern Turkey, there have been wholesale dismissals and even arrests of teachers, bureaucrats and elected officials, including mayors . They are being replaced by appointees from Ankara loyal to the government but frequently lacking in the training required to do their jobs.\\nErdogan\\x92s paranoia and desire for revenge run deep. Alleged coup organiser Fetullah Gulen has been described as the head of a \\x93terrorist organization intent on subduing the entire world, far beyond Turkey.\\x94 Turkish embassies and consulates overseas have been ordered to compile lists of disloyal citizens, and Ankara even sued a German comedian who satirised Erdogan.\\nIn Turkey itself, police and intelligence agents have been arresting people who possess multiple American $1 bills whose serial numbers all start with the same letter. (It is believed that the banknotes were used to establish bona fides among coup plotters.) Reading the wrong newspaper or book has led to firing or imprisonment, while parliamentary critics are being silenced and threatened with arrest after being labelled as terrorists. There have been frequent reports of torture, beatings and even rape of those detained, and Erdogan has supported calls for the death penalty for military officers involved in the coup.\\nAnd then there is the ongoing corruption of Erdogan himself, his family and his close associates. Turkey illegally bought Iranian oil while Iran was under sanctions, and Erdogan\\x92s son Bilal used his tankers to move it to markets in East Asia to sell it. Fearing a police raid at one point, Erdogan telephoned his son and advised him to go to his safe, remove all the money inside and hide it.\\nNow, the government has been arresting businessmen accused of being sympathetic to the coup without presenting any evidence, while also confiscating billions of dollars in assets belonging to their companies. The assets are being \\x93temporarily\\x94 managed by the political associates of Erdogan.\\nErdogan is unfortunately supported by a solid bloc of voters who see the world the same way he does and generally share his intense and often-cited religiosity. He is inspired by his own personal sense of righteousness, and he has exhibited what one might reasonably describe as megalomania, seeing grandiose building projects and a redefinition of Turkey\\x92s domestic and international interests as part and parcel of his own authority and that of his ruling Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (AKP) party (Justice and Development Party).\\nI have previously described how Erdogan\\x92s increasingly aggressive foreign policy has long been driven by a somewhat legitimate fear of the development of an independent Kurdish state, which presumably would incorporate parts of Turkey with northern Syria and Iraq as well as western Iran. Indeed, Erdogan\\x92s recent participation in the fighting against the Islamic State (ISIS) is actually a deliberate misdirection, being instead mostly aimed at striking the Kurdish militias that the US regards as its most effective fighting force against the terrorist groups.\\nMore disturbing still, recent developments suggest that Ankara is now entertaining irredentist claims over former parts of the Ottoman Empire that are adjacent to Turkey\\x92s current borders, including Mosul in Iraq, areas just north of Aleppo in Syria and parts of Greece. Erdogan has argued that he has a responsibility to protect \\x93Turks\\x94 in neighbouring states, a rationalisation that he has been employing to bomb Kurdish-controlled areas and to demand a role in the impending Iraqi assault on Mosul, which has a small Turkmen minority. Iraq\\x92s government, knowing that once Ankara has its foot in the door, it will be difficult to make Turkish soldiers go home, has flatly rejected the offer. Erdogan responded by observing that Turkey has a right to invade Iraq if it feels threatened.\\nThe aim to assert some form of regional dominance is a reversal of Turkey\\x92s former foreign policy, which stressed friendly relations with all its neighbours. One might further suggest that the July coup let the genie out of the bottle, fully liberating Erdogan from whatever restraints he believed himself to be under and giving him an opportunity to rewrite the country\\x92s constitution to enhance and perpetuate his own power, a process that is now well underway.\\nMany reasonably question whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should exist at all after the demise of the Soviet Union, but including Turkey as a member raises some very serious concerns due to Article 5 of the Washington Treaty (which created the alliance). This provision requires all members to respond to a military threat against any member state as a \\x93collective defense.\\x94 As the alliance purports to be defensive in nature, Turkey\\x92s irredentist claims are problematic \\x96 particularly as it would not be difficult to contrive an incident that would make an offensive operation appear to be self-defence. Such an incident took place in December 2015 with the clearly premeditated downing of a Russian warplane that had strayed over the border into Turkey for 17 seconds. Turkey regarded the incursion as an act of war. Fortunately, Moscow was restrained in its response, and the situation did not escalate in military terms. So, the issue of NATO involvement, though it briefly surfaced in Brussels, was essentially moot.\\nIn addition, as a basically European-American alliance, NATO has long taken as a given that member states will conform to reasonably democratic norms. That is something that Turkey is rapidly moving away from with its mass arrests, show trials and collective punishments while Erdogan seeks to aggrandise his position by enhancing his own presidential powers. As Doug Bandow of the Cato Institute puts it , \\x93Turkey\\x92s brief democratic moment is ending.\\x94\\nFor the United States, the calculus is somewhat complicated. Hillary Clinton will likely up the ante in Syria, which will require the use of the airbase at Incirlik. But after that, presuming that a Third World War can somehow be averted while the escalation and intervention are taking place, the role of Turkey should be re-evaluated based on strategic considerations distinct from the current fighting in Iraq and Syria. Ankara\\x92s status as a long-term strategic asset should certainly be challenged, particularly in light of the Erdogan government\\x92s authoritarian predilections.\\nMost observers in Washington now believe that ISIS will soon be defeated as a territorial threat, though it likely will retain a base of operations in troubled Libya. That means any continued operations against the group will be conducted by special ops and intelligence personnel, and thus will not require extensive infrastructure and support. As the US will retain major regional military assets in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar, Turkey will become a backwater and a Cold War relic, redundant, with Washington instead increasingly focused on security issues surrounding Iran and the Sunni-Shia conflict.\\nAnkara persists in believing that its current strategic importance means that it can do or say anything and Washington will avoid any criticism, but the White House is clearly beginning to recognise that Turkey is, in the long run, a liability as long as Erdogan\\x92s brand of democratic centralism prevails. And it must be observed that the current bilateral relationship, in which the administration leans over backwards to placate an invariably irritable Erdogan, produces bad policy. In the recent contretemps with Baghdad over an enhanced Turkish role in Mosul, Secretary of State John Kerry unwisely urged the Iraqis to let the Turks become a partner in the enterprise. He was tone deaf to other considerations of which the government in Baghdad and America\\x92s Kurdish partners were all too aware.\\nThe White House should recognise that Turkey has become a destabilising force in the Near East. Its past collusion with \\x96 and arming of \\x96 terrorist groups like ISIS reveals that it is not unwilling to play a double game against its nominal allies. Its implacable hostility towards all things Kurdish affects the internal stability of nearly all of its neighbours and even diminishes Washington\\x92s ability to deal with ISIS. Its increasingly assertive nationalism, which is beginning to define itself as irredentism \\x96 backed by what is still, after the purge of thousands of personnel, the most powerful military in the region \\x96 could easily morph into a series of local conflicts as Ankara seeks to realign its borders.\\nIf Turkey continues to remain in NATO, and if the US persists in being closely tied to it logistically, the eventual consequences could be grave, with Washington again drawn into a Middle East quagmire by virtue of a war that it is neither prepared for nor seeking to fight.\\nPhilip Giraldi, a former CIA officer, is executive director of the Council for the National Interest.\\nThis piece was first published on The American Conservative .

The reference is to the three-man race in 1992 between George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.

       " ['Former Classmate: Trump Smacked His Son So Hard It Knocked ‘Him To The Floor’ | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave',\n",
       "  \"on November 4, 2016 12:25 pm · \\nWe’ve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. It’s a life most of us can never imagine while we’re paying our monthly bills. So what’s it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr.’s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star’s son wasn’t what one might imagine. Or, given Trump’s temperament, it might be exactly what you’d imagine. \\nOn Facebook , Mekler told of the animosity Trump’s son had for this father. \\n“I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.’s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son’s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,” he recalls. “There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey.” \\nThen Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. \\n“Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said “put on a suit and meet me outside,” and closed the door,” Melker wrote. \\n“Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,” he continued. “He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was “Diaper Don,” because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people’s beds and urinate.” “I always felt terrible for him,” he continued. \\nMekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because “in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.” \\nTo be clear, we are not demonizing Trump’s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker’s story is accurate or not, we’re not sure, but given Trump’s awful temper, it’s difficult to discount it. \\nPhoto by Saul Loeb-Pool via Getty. Share this Article!

       " ['Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence | RedFlag News',\n",
       "  '\\nby Michael Snyder via THE DAILY SHEEPLE \\nCould we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? \\nLet’s hope that it doesn’t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. \\nAt this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned “about the possibility of violence” on election day… \\nA 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are “very concerned.” Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are “very confident” about that. \\nMore than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won’t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn’t have won fair and square. \\nBut many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… \\nDonald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. \\nAnd there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump’s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June … \\nThis is of course not the first time the GOP candidate’s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump’s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump’s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. \\nWe have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” along with a swastika. \\nThere have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… \\nOn Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, “Why can’t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?” \\nAround Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. “The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‘some thugs’ that a barmaid called out from the back.” Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a “Blue Lives Matter” shirt. \\nOn Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. \\nThere is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let’s certainly hope that we don’t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. \\nOf course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. \\nFor example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is “grabbing my musket” if Donald Trump loses the election… \\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. \\nWalsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” \\nAnd without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today … \\n“Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I’ve been buying a lot more ammunition,” says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan’s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to “declare martial law and take our guns away” after the election. \\nToday America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. \\nIronically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . \\nIf Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton’s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. \\nAnd the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month … \\nAs I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. \\nBut at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . \\nOut of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. \\nPerhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.

       " ['Here Are Six ‘Miracle’ Drugs Big Pharma Now Regrets - Truthdig',\n",
       "  'Here Are Six ‘Miracle’ Drugs Big Pharma Now Regrets Posted on Oct 29, 2016 \\nBy Martha Rosenberg / AlterNet Shutterstock \\nAre you depressed? It may have less to do with your mood than your birth control pills, high blood pressure pills, antibiotics or even anti-hair-loss drug according to new research. New risks have also emerged with popular gastroesophageal reflux disease medicines and even the top-selling painkiller Tylenol. \\nThere are two reasons the risks associated with popular drugs seem to trail their aggressive promotion. Certainly, as millions use brand name drugs, dangerous side effects and adverse events are seen that did not emerge in much smaller clinical trials. Who knew? But also, as AlterNet has noted before, dangerous side effects that might be considered major drawbacks to prescribing the drugs often emerge only when drugs have gone “off patent” and all their profit potential is realized. For both reasons, drug safety activists recommend waiting five years before taking a “new” drug—until it is not “new” anymore. \\nAdvertisement \\nHere are drugs and drug classes that have raised new concerns. \\n1. Proton Pump Inhibitors \\nOne of Pharma’s most successful gambits has been its proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like Nexium (the “Purple Pill”) and Prilosec that reduce stomach acid. To sell the drugs, Pharma aggressively raised “awareness” of gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD a rare condition which, over time, can change the lining of the esophagus and lead to cancer. Actually, most PPI users have simple heartburn. Even babies are now given PPIs for “baby reflux” because they spit up 71 times a day—a normal occurrence that has been pathologized. \\nThe medical establishment has deplored PPI overuse, pointing out that heartburn can exist without esophageal damage and vice verse and calling PPIs “purple crack.” Now it turns out they are right—acid reducers are addictive. “Once a patient has taken a PPI for longer than a few weeks, acid hypersecretion can occur on discontinuation,” says a recent article in Pharmaceutical Journal. “This causes rebound symptoms, and frequently establishes a vicious cycle of drug reinitiation and long-term continuation.” \\nAdverse effects of long-term PPI use are well documented from the risks of the dread intestinal infection Clostridium difficile (“C Diff”), bone thinning and fractures and vitamin and mineral deficiencies to chronic kidney disease and heart attacks. Now there is a new reported risk: dementia. \\nA study earlier this year in JAMA Neurology of 73,?679 people 75 or older with no dementia and taking PPIs found the patients “had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving PPI.” Other studies have also found a link. \\n2. Antibiotics \\nAlterNet has frequently written about underreported antibiotic dangers, most recently of the fluoroquinolone class which includes Cipro and Levaquin. Even as the FDA tries to curtail use of antibiotics on the nation’s farms to make animals grow faster (a use which accounts for most U.S. antibiotic sales) drug use on the farm is actually increasing. The FDA’s 2014 Summary Report on Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food Producing Animals reveals that cephalosporin sales increased by 57 percent between 2009 through 2014, sales of antibiotics like clindamycin increased by 150 percent and sales of antibiotics like gentamicin, a dangerous drug class, increased by 36 percent. \\nAntibiotics have a probable role in obesity—why wouldn’t they when they add pounds to livestock? In 1974, Navy recruits were given antibiotics to see if they would gain weight, and after only seven weeks, they did. Similar results were seen in children in Guatemala and in babies . But making people fat or encouraging antibiotic resistant microbes like MRSA are the least of the risks, it turns out. \\nWe now know that the bacteria in our gut, the microbiome, which antibiotics compromise as they kill the “bad” bacteria, are responsible for much more than good digestion. Antibiotics also affect the brain and “influence our mood and temperament,” says food expert Michael Pollan. “If you transplant the gut microbiota of relaxed and adventurous mice into the guts of timid and anxious mice they become less stressed and more adventurous.” Antibiotic-affected microbiomes may also be behind asthma and autoimmune diseases, acne and even autism, say published reports. \\n3. Birth Control Pills You know the long list of side effects and warnings at the end of drug ads? Telling you the drug may cause you to bleed to death or have a stroke while you look at images of sunsets and puppies? We have women’s health advocates to thank for the disclosures. Fifty years ago when the Pill first became available, there was no “disclosure.” Women did not know what effects birth control pills would have on their bodies—or even think it was theirright to know—and were supposed to take them anyway.\\nBy 1970, after The Doctors’ Case Against the Pill by Barbara Seaman was published, Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson held hearings about clear links between the Pill and depression, blood clots and decrease in libido cited nowhere on the label. No women were asked to speak at the hearings, moving Alice Wolfson, a co-founder of the National Women’s Health Network, to say, “It must be admitted that women make superb guinea pigs. They don’t cost anything, they feed themselves, they clean their own cages, pay for their own pills, and remunerate the clinical observer. We will no longer tolerate intimidation by white-coated gods antiseptically directing our lives.” \\nWhy were feminists so angry about a drug that let them control their reproduction? Because the Pill caused 50 additional physiological changes besides stopping pregnancy, some of which were and are life-threatening. Women were told by the the male-dominated medical establishment not to worry their pretty heads about what the drugs were doing to their bodies, while men were spared any responsibility or medical risks. \\nFast-forward to this year, when medical studies again confirmed links between birth control pills and depression. A Danish study of more than a million women found links between birth control pills and depression, especially in young women, and corresponding higher use of antidepressant drugs. \\nWomen’s health advocates were finally vindicated. “The risk of depression has been recognized since women were able to get their hands on oral contraceptives,” says Cindy Pearson of the National Women’s Health Network. “It’s been reported by women for 50 years.” \\nA 2013 book called Sweetening the Pill: or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control might also be vindicated, writes Lara Prendergast. The book was called “a dishonest anti-Pill treatise” because the author “dared to point out that hormonal contraceptives are ranked by the World Health Organization as a class-one carcinogen alongside tobacco and asbestos,” she writes. \\n4. Propecia \\nTwo years ago, AlterNet told readers about Propecia, a popular treatment for male pattern baldness linked to disturbing side effects in men including sexual dysfunction and actual reduction in penis size. At the time, Propecia’s label assured users that sexual side effects “went away in men who stopped taking Propecia”; however, the current label warns about sexual dysfunction like “erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality” that continues after discontinuation of treatment. \\nA September study in BMJ found “the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased for users of finasteride 1mg compared with unexposed men with alopecia [hair loss],” but reports of the disturbing side effects abound in medical j ournals and popular magazines. \\n“Emerging research and a slew of lawsuits suggest that finasteride may be more dangerous than previously believed, with side effects — inability to orgasm, painful erections, chronic depression, insomnia, brain fog, and suicidal thoughts — that can last long after patients stop taking the pill,” wrote Men’s Journal last year. \\nDespite the life-changing side effects, Propecia/finasteride is still aggressively sold with warnings about its use downplayed and hard to find. In fact, “As of Sept. 26, the World Health Organization Program for International Drug Monitoring’s database of adverse drug reactions contained 13,546 finasteride ADRs [adverse drug reactions], including 3,577 sexual function and fertility disorders, 1,526 depressed mood disorders and disturbances, and 67 completed suicides,” writes the Post-Finasteride Syndrome Foundation . \\n5. Tylenol \\nTylenol may be one of the most widely used pain relieving drugs in the world but new safety concerns continue to emerge. The risk of liver damage with Tylenol (acetaminophen) that can occur from taking even a slightly higher dose than directed moved Tylenol maker, Johnson & Johnson to increase warnings in 2014. Unintentional acetaminophen overdoses cause as many as 26,000 hospitalizations and 458 deaths per year reported the FDA. \\nSoon after the increased warnings, medical journals linked acetaminophen to birth defects in the children of women taking the drug such as poor motor development, behavior problems and language delays. A study in JAMA Pediatrics identified an increased occurrence of ADHD by the age of seven in children whose mothers took acetaminophen. A study in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children more likely to have behavior problems and slow motor development by the age of three if their mothers had taken acetaminophen. Not all medical voices concur. Some said the studies were poorly designed or that fevers , for which the mother presumably took acetaminophen, are responsible for the birth defects. \\nIn recent years, acetaminophen has been found to have psychological and mental effects not before described. The pain reliever may “blunt individuals’ reactivity to a range of negative stimuli in addition to physical pain,” says one study. Another study found acetaminophen reduced the psychological pain caused by social rejection. \\n6. Beta Blockers \\nOne out of three American has high blood pressure and beta-blockers like atenolol (Tenormin), carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol, propranolol (Inderal), sotalol (Betapace) and timolol (Timoptic) which treat the condition have been linked to depression for many years. \\nAs early as 1967, the British Medical Journal reported that hypertensive patients treated with propranolol for cardiac arrhythmias experienced a rise in the incidence of depression. Still, it has not been known if patients’ depressions were caused by the actual actions of beta blockers (like blocking the effects of epinephrine/adrenaline and slowing heart rate) or mood conditions associated with the diseases for which beta blockers are prescribed such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. \\nNow, the evidence is tipping toward the drugs. An October study in the journal Hypertension found that beta blockers “may have a role in the pathogenesis or course of mood disorders” and increased hospital admissions for mood disorders. A “bidirectional relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease” exists, says the study , “because of the overlapping pathophysiological processes that underlie both conditions.” \\n“There is a lot of data that depression and cardiovascular disease are related ... but current hypertensive practices do not consider depression,” said the study’s lead author Sandosh Padmanabhan. “There could be some people who are predisposed to depression who we should not be giving these drugs.” \\n'],\n",

       " ['CNN Host STUNNED By What Paul Ryan Just Said About Post-Election Racist Attacks (VIDEO) – New Century Times',\n",
       "  'Share on Facebook \\nThere’s no doubt about it – the election of Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States has riled up the reality television star’s hateful supporters – hate crimes have dramatically increased across the country. To add to the fear and frustration that many Americans are feeling, the Republican Party doesn’t even have the guts to admit that the divisive rhetoric it has been spewing for decades has contributed to not only Trump’s rise, but the hateful attitudes that helped him get elected. \\nThis denial and lack of responsibility was on full display on CNN’s State of the Union this morning, when host Jake Tapper interviewed Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. When Tapper cornered Ryan and asked him to speak to the people who are afraid of the violence and hate crimes against minorities and women that have occurred post-election, Ryan said: \\n“First of all, I hate it that people feel this way. And second of all, they should not. I think people should be rest assured, America is a pluralistic inclusive country. It is, it has been and it will continue to be. So, I really think people should put their minds at ease.” \\nTapper pressed him, reminding him that this was a serious, nationwide issue. Ryan responded by shocking Tapper and Americans when he denied that the GOP had any role in it, stating that the Trump supporters that were responsible for these awful acts aren’t Republicans. \\n“That’s terrible. By the way, that’s not Republicans. We are the party of Lincoln. People who espouse those views, they’re not Republicans. We don’t want them in our party even if they’re thinking about it.” \\nFor the record, these attackers ARE most certainly conservatives whose main goal is to Make America White Again – there is no getting around this fact. And just when you thought Ryan couldn’t be any more full of sh*t, he said: \\n“And I’m confident Donald Trump feels the same way.” \\nIs he serious? Ryan and many other prominent Republicans have spent the last several months condemning Trump for his racism and hateful, divisive rhetoric – and even then, they were complete cowards. These GOPers distanced themselves from his actions, but never had enough of a backbone to actually do what was right and vote against him. Their loyalty to their hateful, discriminatory party has always prevented them from doing the right thing, and thanks to them we will now have a racist misogynist leading our country. \\nYou can watch the interview below: \\nFor Republican leaders to deny responsibility in what is now happening in our country is repulsive. They created a political climate that allowed Trump to thrive, and they supported a presidential candidate who encouraged the very violence and discrimination that we are now seeing. The GOP will not be forgiven, and they should not be able to pretend they didn’t contribute to this mess. \\nFeatured image is a screenshot Patti Colli My passion is bringing attention to human rights and equality issues.

       " ['President Trump vs President Clinton … What Will Happen After Inauguration? | The Vineyard of the Saker',\n",
       "  '3454 Views November 07, 2016 15 Comments Guest Posts The Saker \\nby Oleg Maslov \\nThe time has come for the country with the largest economy and military in the world will soon go to the polls to choose a new leader for itself. Americans will elect a new president on November 8, 2016. However, the two main candidates running for the office of president in the general election have never been more different from each other. Hillary Clinton has lived in the White House as First Lady for 8 years, served as a senator, ran for president in 2008, and served as Secretary of State during Barack Obama’s first term, during which she oversaw the NATO intervention in Libya and the Benghazi crisis – in other words, a career politician. On the other hand, Donald Trump has never served in public office, instead dedicating his life to many different business ventures, some of which became runaway successes and others short-lived failures. \\nBoth candidates boast considerable strengths and face off against damaging scandals. Clinton has been touted as the ‘most qualified candidate for the job’ and has decades of experience in and around the center of power in Washington. However, she is currently under investigation by the FBI for potentially mishandling classified information after using a private email server to send and receive emails while Secretary of State, faced allegations of corruption relating to donations from foreign entities to the Clinton Foundation in return for political favors, responded to leaked email suggested that the Democratic National Convention colluded with major media companies against Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders, and dealt with ongoing accusations of husband Bill Clinton’s sexual relations and infidelities. On the other hand, Trump has pointed to his wealth to promote himself as a self-made billionaire capable of hard negotiations and used his status as a political outsider status to make his promise to change to the establishment believable. He has also been the target of sexual harassment allegations, responded to claims that some of his failed businesses may have been scams, battled accusations of involvement with white supremacy groups, and is the only candidate for president from a major party not to release tax information since Gerald Ford. \\nComparing the individual factors and history of both candidates gives us considerable information for analysis, but what effect will the policies of the candidates bring to the world once they enter office? In the following sections, we pit Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in a head-to-head comparison, analyzing the likely outcomes of their policies on global conflicts, the world economy, American social and business conditions, the future of Europe, and US relations with Russia and China. \\nGlobal Conflicts \\nHillary Clinton \\nThe former Secretary of State has been labeled by some analysts as a representative of the ‘hawks’ in Washington, or the group of influencers who are pro-war and closely connected with the American military industrial complex. Hillary Clinton voted for the American interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Senator and spearheaded the American push for the NATO-imposed ‘no-fly zone’ in Libya as well as the US support for ‘moderate rebels’ in Syria as Secretary of State in the Obama administration. \\nA vote for Hillary is a vote for continuing the foreign policies of the Obama administration, including the expansion of NATO activities in Eastern Europe, intensifying American actions against the government of Bashar al-Assad, ramping up US naval might in the South China Sea, and arming and supporting Saudi Arabia in its military operation against Yemen. \\nOne policy favored by Hillary Clinton adequately sums up the potential effects of a Clinton administration on global security: Hillary Clinton has publicly advocated for the implementation of a ‘no-fly zone’ and ‘safe zones’ within Syria. Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of State, succinctly outlined the consequences of such a policy last month when he explained to the US Senate that carrying out this policy would require the United States to “go to war against Syria and Russia”, something unequivocally negative for both regional and global security and something which will certainly exacerbate tensions in Syria rather than relieve them. \\nTrump expresses the greatest fear that such a policy may bring when he says that such proposals may start World War III. \\nMuch can be written on the other conflicts mentioned, but the general trend is relatively apparent – a Clinton presidency would continue aggressive American policies which only increase tensions and create the possibility for a spark to light the powder keg of conflict. \\nDonald Trump \\nIf a Clinton administration would be predictably aggressive, a Trump administration would be an unpredictable wild card for global security. Many point to Trump’s open call for good relations between the US and Russia, even for cooperation between the two countries in tackling the Islamic State, as a sign of a period of peace and stabilization of the global security climate under a Trump administration. However, others react with alarm when they hear Trump criticize the usefulness of NATO or seemingly advocate for the proliferation of nuclear weapons, although these apparent Trump policies are often taken out of context. \\nTrump has consistently called for an increased ‘sharing of the burden’ from NATO partners and other American partners, notably Japan and South Korea. His campaign claims that the remarks that Trump made about the usefulness NATO and the proliferation of nuclear weapons was an extreme example meant to show the necessity of convincing American partners to pay more for the US military umbrella and that Trump has no intention of disbanding NATO or allowing states like Saudi Arabia or Japan to get nuclear weapons. \\nHowever, if Trump’s drive to push more of the financial burden of US military protection onto allies were to fail, he may be forced to carry out his promises, at least to some degree, if only to save face. Trump’s public intentions to mend ties with Russia and pursue cooperation in Syria combined with the potential for a weaker US presence in Europe may in fact encourage Russia to act more aggressively in pursuing their own interests in Europe and the Middle East. \\nOne country has been disproportionately targeted by Trump – China. Trump has campaigned on the idea that China has been playing the United States for a sucker and that the US-Chinese relationship has been beneficial mostly for one side. His promises to renegotiate trade deals with China (which could be potentially quite harmful for China) could well have to be enforced by naval power projection, and Trump may end up following many of the same naval policies in the South China Sea as the Obama administration. This would, of course, raise tensions between the United States and China. \\nTrump’s proposals and policies have not been thoroughly tested and their success at stabilizing the world situation are far from assured. Although Trump tends to appear more interested in fostering peace and cooling down global conflict, the tensions created by his policies, especially with respect to China, may in fact increase the possibility of conflict, showing just how unpredictable a Trump administration may be. \\nWorld Economy \\nDonald Trump \\nTrump has positioned himself as a pro-business candidate that will stimulate the US economy, and many of his proposed policies could potentially have positive effects. However, Trump’s heavy criticism of global trade agreements, including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific-Partnership (TPP), as well as Trump’s intention to force American companies to bring their business operations back from other countries in an attempt to reverse the process of ‘offshorization’ may well benefit the American economy, but may in fact deal some heavy damage to the global economy. \\nPolicies that benefit the United States directly, such as encouraging auto manufacturers to return production to American soil by raising tariffs on autos made by American companies in other countries, will have a negative effect on other countries. Agreements such as the TTIP would certainly raise global economic activity, despite the fact that they benefit one side over the other, and would raise the level of global economic activity. It follows that delaying or disrupting negotiations on these agreements may lead to more negative consequences for the world economy as a whole. \\nTrump’s public call for better relations with Russia may have the effect of reducing or even removing sanctions thereby restoring former business between Russia and Europe as well as creating new business relationships which compensate for negative effects of other policies on the world economy. Further, if Trump’s promises for peace and stabilization of global conflicts is carried out, economic activity and innovation would continue without any obstacle. \\nHillary Clinton \\nA Clinton administration would continue to develop the economic strategy initiated by the Obama administration, including liberal policies toward corporate offshoring and advancement of global trade deals such as TTIP and TPP. In essence, these policies would produce slow but stable growth for the world economy. Maintaing the sanctions on Russia would restrict global growth but if negotiations on either TTIP or TPP would result in an agreement, the resulting economic activity would more than make up for that lost business. \\nThe Clinton administration may appear to offer better opportunities for the global economy, but one major factor still needs consideration. Clinton’s preference for resolution of conflicts by military means, seen most acutely in her proposals for resolving the Syrian situation, have a high potential to lead to a wider conflict with Russia and Iran, and ultimately may lead to a third global war, a war in which the main adversaries have a vast amount of deliverable nuclear weapons as well as a protocol for using them, should the need arise. \\nNeedless to say, any conflict in which nuclear weapons are used is unequivocally negative for the global economy in the short term, if a global economy even remains after the dust has settled. If a global war remains conventional or if nuclear weapons are used in limited capacity, the prospect for global economic growth in the medium term is quite positive given the need to rebuild the affected countries, but the loss of life, destruction of productive infrastructure and buildings, and long term psychological and social effects far outweigh the economic growth related to rebuilding what was lost. \\nUS Social and Business Conditions \\nHillary Clinton \\nAs the status quo candidate, Hillary Clinton represents a future similar to the present conditions with small but noticeable changes. Although controversial, Obama’s healthcare plan, commonly referred to as ‘Obamacare’, did bring healthcare insurance to more Americans. Clinton will most certainly continue developing Obamacare, which may improve the lives of many people. Hillary has also proposed a plan to finance higher education for students whose household earns a combined income of less than $125,000 per year, something seen as positive for standard of living and development of future business conditions. \\nClinton’s willingness to accept more refugees from the war torn Middle East may increase already palpable social tensions by increasing competition for low-wage jobs and undermining social cohesion. The liberal policies of allowing companies to seek lower cost labor in other countries will continue to send jobs out of the United States, leaving university graduates, already suffering from low employment rates, with even fewer work opportunities. \\nDespite meeting with mothers of black teens killed by police, Hillary has no practical solution for addressing the growing issue of perceived racial prejudice by police officers. Neither does Donald Trump for that matter. \\nDonald Trump \\nTrump’s strongest potential option for improving the social and business conditions in the US is his promise to force American companies to bring production back to the United States. Fulfilling this promise would create many jobs in the US and alleviate the millennial unemployment problem, all the while raising wages and the overall standard of living. Although xenophobic and perhaps even racially charged in nature, Trump’s intention to limit immigration may also create more low-wage opportunities for American citizens. \\nTrump has called for an increase in paid maternity leave, something which may quality of life for average people. One of his main campaign promises is to revise and simplify the tax system. If done properly, this policy will make filing taxes easier for normal citizens and businesses as well, improving business conditions and potentially creating more jobs and economic activity. \\nOn the other hand, Trump is widely seen as a candidate who represents white male superiority and the mere fact of a Trump administration may cause an increase in already palpable social tensions, potentially even leading to open protest from Muslim or Hispanic groups among others at his presidency. The Clinton campaign has worked to paint Trump as a white supremacist and misogynist, and often successfully so. Despite the potential economic benefits of a Trump presidency, the potential explosion of social tensions may cause an overall negative social and business situation in the United States. Of course, a Trump administration will recognize this danger and will make every attempt to prevent it. \\nThe Future of Europe \\nDonald Trump \\nA Trump presidency would entail a major reversal of policies for many Eastern European countries, including the Baltic States, Poland, and Ukraine, when it comes to European relations with Russia. Trump has not only publicly questioned the utility of NATO, but has also called for better relations with Russia, both concepts which are anathema to many Eastern European nations. If Trump were to decrease the American footprint in Europe and to attempt to build better relations with Russia, many European nations would be forced to rethink some of their main strategic objectives at the very least. The current government of Ukraine would be one of the biggest losers in Europe should Trump become president and may even be pushed out of power, either peacefully or forcefully, should Trump choose to sacrifice American support for Ukraine in exchange for better relations with Russia, including recognition of Crimea as Russian territory. \\nA decrease in US forces on mainland Europe as well as American engineered political obstacles to cooperation between Europe and Russia would naturally lead to a blossoming of relations between Europe and Russia. Under a Trump presidency, one may expect a significant rollback of European sanctions on Russia and significant growth in Russia-Europe trade and relations. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Parliamentary Assembly for the Council of Europe (PACE) would regain influence in regulating Europe-Russia relations. European-Chinese relations would also grow dynamically as ‘Silk Road’ projects through Russia would take on new relevance. \\nMany so-called ‘Euroskeptic’ movements and otherwise ‘right of center’ political groups would gain influence and perhaps even become part of the mainstream political configuration. Parties like Marine Le Pen’s Front National, Alternative fuer Deutschland, Austria’s Freedom Party, and Golden Dawn in Greece could make a grand entrance into mainstream politics while ruling parties in Hungary and Italy could become even more entrenched. Pushed forward by Brexit, this trend would bring considerable momentum behind the a drive for the dissolution of the European Union, at least for the monetary union, but this remains unlikely. \\nA Trump presidency may even allow for the start of negotiations between Europe and Russia on a comprehensive trade and political agreement to regulate relations. Numerous politicians, including Francois Mitterand and Vladimir Putin, have spoken about a free trade zone stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostock, but if China has any say in the matter, the zone will extend to Singapore and cover the entire supercontinent of Eurasia. If this concept were to ever become reality, European nations would gain influence over developing nations and receive access to valuable and profitable investment opportunities. \\nFurther, any major agreement between the United States and Russia on Middle Eastern policy would entail a significant slowdown of the current migration crisis as well as a noticeable reduction in terrorist related activity. Europe may even join a coalition of the US and Russia to fight terrorism. Lastly, US missile defense systems in Poland and Romania are likely to be dismantled. \\nHillary Clinton \\nA Hillary Clinton presidency would entail business as usual with Europe and a continuation of the current trends and policies initiated by the Obama administration. The major features of a Clinton presidency would include continued military build-up in Baltic states, continuation of European sanctions against Russia, increased support for the Ukrainian government, increased media hype about the Russian military threat, and a further break-down in the systems that govern Europe-Russia relations, such as the OSCE and PACE. \\nA Clinton presidency would entail an increase in the number of American troops in mainland Europe as well as an increase in joint US-European defense projects, including expansions of the missile defense project. More US-led NATO troops, groupings, and exercises would take place in the Baltic countries and a Clinton administration would push for Sweden and Finland closer to NATO, with the ultimate purpose to convince the Scandinavian countries to join the military block. Expect increased media reports about air force interceptions and Russian submarine scandals. \\nAny European Union political party that has a neutral or favorable position to Russia will come under increased scrutiny and will face attacks on multiple fronts, mostly through the media. The EU will work to make examples of governments such as Hungary, Greece, and Italy that actively resist sanctions against Russia and attempt to circumvent sanctions by making their own economic arrangements with Russia. \\nEurope will be pressured to sign TTIP and will most likely become more and more dependent on the United States for economic and political policy. More LNG terminals will be built on the European mainland so that European countries can import natural gas from America and Qatar so that dependence on Russia is decreased. China will place less of an effort on the Silk Road overland trade route and will have to make a different trade arrangement with Europe. \\nMiddle East migration numbers will continue in full force as US policy in the Middle East will continue to favor interventionist hawks, forcing reluctant European nations to accept more and more refugees from Middle Eastern nations. The threat of terrorism will remain high and terrorist attacks are likely to occur again on European soil. \\nUS Relations with Russia and China \\nHillary Clinton \\nA Clinton administration will continue to play a double game with China, continuing the liberal policies of offshoring production to Chinese companies and maintaining a strong trade relationship on the one hand, but encircling China militarily with naval hardware and trade partnerships with local Chinese rivals. China will have a difficult time trying to push its goods to Europe through the Eurasian continent as the US will actively block attempts to create a Silk Road structure leading either through Russia or through Iran. However, on the surface, the US will continue to maintain a careful policy of wary respect toward China, never making overt insults or provocations and maintaining an air of pretentious respect. \\nRelations with Russia will be characterized by increased support to Russia’s enemies in Ukraine and Syria, as well as attempts to undermine the governments in Belarus and Central Asian countries. President Clinton will push European allies to increase economic pressure on Russia and media coverage of Russia from all ideological sides of American media will turn increasingly negative. All of this will take place while the United States will continue to do business with Russia as usual, buying rocket engines, space transport services, grain, and even certain types of weapons as if there was no issue in bilateral relations. \\nDonald Trump \\nThe strategic economic goals of a Trump presidency would almost immediately begin to cause problems for Chinese-American relations. If Trump acts on his promises to raise tariffs for American companies producing goods in foreign countries and then shipping them to the US, many businesses with manufacturing operations in China will be forced to shut down their Chinese subsidiaries, causing significant losses for China. China would potentially experience a major economic downturn as many of its factories and industrial centers would be forced out of business. China would not leave such an unkind gesture unanswered and would most likely sell a significant portion of its US Treasury bills and bonds on the market, or simply demand early payment, leading to a period of financial troubles for the US. \\nAmerican-Russian relations would potentially enter into a new and unprecedented period of mutual understanding and cooperation. President Trump would work to open Russia’s massive market even further to American companies and would deepen partnerships between the US and Russia in areas like space exploration and development, energy distribution and marketing, and perhaps even reopen programs focusing on purchase and delivery of Russian military hardware to groups supported by the Pentagon, including the program to arm and train the Afghan military with Russian helicopters. \\nIn all, both candidates offer substantially different visions of the future, and it is up to individual voters to decide which vision appears more rational and beneficial for both the United States and the world at large.

       "  'Getty - Tibrina Hobson \\nCandace Cameron Bure has never been shy about voicing her opinions on social and political issues — a trait that has made her an exceptionally good fit at ABC\\'s “The View,” as she stood out in contrast to the decidedly liberal viewpoints of many of her co-hosts. \\nBut aside from praying (with Whoopi, no less) for the election cycle to be over soon: A video posted by Candace Cameron Bure (@candacecbure) on Oct 26, 2016 at 9:35am PDT \\nBure has kept her 2016 voting plans under her hat, noting earlier this summer that although she wasn\\'t exactly thrilled with the remaining choices, she absolutely planned to vote: \\n\"I\\'ve talked about how conflicted I am. I\\'m not happy with the ultimate choices that we\\'re left with, but I\\'m still going to go out there and vote because I do believe that it\\'s my right. And I think there are other things we have to consider. \\nAnd then there\\'s the congressional power. There\\'s also the seats in Congress. And I think a lot of people who don\\'t show up to vote for the president then forget that there\\'s all these other people we get to vote into Congress. So you\\'re giving up so much just because you don\\'t like the candidate choices.\" \\nShe did reveal the issue that has her most concerned this election cycle , however, in a recent podcast with “The Church Boys”: \\n\"The biggest thing for me is the Supreme Court justices… because, no matter who wins this election, it’s four years, maybe eight, if they’re reelected, but that’s the maximum. \\nThe Supreme Court justice seats will be until those people die — and that could be a very long time.\" \\nA number of Americans share Bure\\'s concern, noting the age of several sitting justices. \\nAccording to ballotpedia , with the increasing likelihood that Justice Scalia\\'s seat will remain empty into the next president\\'s term, the next president could potentially appoint four justices: \\n“The average age at which a Supreme Court justice retires is 78.7 years old. Justice Kennedy will be 80 when the next president takes office, Justice Ginsburg will be 83, and Justice Breyer will be 78.” \\nBure explained her concern by noting that she has spent time recently studying the “bigger picture” and the principles outlined by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution: \\n“If we get too far away from what our Founding Fathers wrote up for us in how this country will be different from all other ones, then we will lose it.” \\nBut in order to hold on to what we have, Bure says that it\\'s not about putting faith in Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton — or any candidate, for that matter. \\nInstead, she says her faith remains unshakable in Jesus Christ, and that she will pray for the wisdom of whomever wins the election.

       " ['After the US elections – World Exit! | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World Only citizens can vote in the US Presidential elections, yet the impact is global. The world is suddenly in disarray, in panic. A man notorious for his bigoted rhetoric, a man who believes in American exceptionalism, who wants to build the walls and to ‘restore order’, has been elected the 45 th President of the mightiest nation on Earth. His nation is doubtlessly in decline; it is indebted and some would even argue, hopelessly bankrupt, but it is still the Empire, the sole one to this day. Below the surface, Mr. Trump may not be any viler than the Democratic candidate Mrs. Clinton and her clan has been for years. The establishment with which she has been inseparably intertwined for years and decades has been murdering millions all over the world, looting entire continents, and brutally guaranteeing that the Western world would always stay firmly in control of the entire Planet. Throughout the years, Mrs. Clinton has been using ‘politically correct’ rhetoric, mainly (and often in a twisted way) in order to silence those who dared to criticize her deeds. Still, no matter what her words were stating, millions of people have been vanishing, worldwide, as a result of the policies introduced by her and by her former boss, President Barack Obama. Donald Trump is brusque, aggressive, narcissistic and most likely, brutally honest. What he says is often pure trash, but whatever it is, he is not embarrassed to parade it in public. He has been giving many advanced warnings to both his supporters (including his voters) and to his adversaries. Objectively speaking, he is not any more or any less dangerous than Mrs. Clinton. Both candidates come from the moneyed, pro-establishment milieu. Yet Mr. Trump evokes much greater fear all over the world than his rival, from Asia and Africa to Latin America. It is at least partially because the mainstream Western propaganda rallied determinedly behind the well-tested and ‘reliable’ Mrs. Clinton (she has proven to be subservient to the Western imperialist regime and to market fundamentalist dogmas), and the Western mainstream media is exactly what is giving ‘marching orders’ to the local press, particularly in ‘client’ states in all parts of the world. * Nonetheless, Mr. Trump is definitely frightening on his own account, and just because he ran against (and defeated) the establishment candidate, does not make him less so. Rowan Wolf, Managing Editor at The Greanville Post and publisher of Uncommon Thought , recently summarized what I felt about the recent elections, when she wrote to me (it was right after the results were announced): “ I am frightened over the election of Trump. Things were going to be bad here even without that because his position as the candidate for president legitimated the ugliest bigotry and violence. His election, legitimates and institutionalizes it at the highest levels possible. It is not as if this ugliness was not present in the US as it certainly was, but it was not celebrated. His racism extends outside the US and he has already stated numerous times that he would use nukes in the Middle East and just take the oil. He also hates the Earth. He plans to reverse or remove all environmental protections and regulations, and he doesn’t “believe” in global warming. His presidency could not happen at a worse time for our planet.” * I had the extremely bad fortune of spending ‘the day after’ in the den of the Western pro-establishment mainstream media based in Asia Pacific – the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Thailand (FCCT). Or perhaps it was not only ‘bad fortune’ but also some type of perverse desire to witness the great and genuine desperation of those who have, for years and decades, been serving the Empire and its ‘liberal’ dogmas, twisting the truth and manufacturing hyper-reality. Even before my arrival at the FCCT, the results of elections were finalized. I expected a great mess, and mess it was. I witnessed depressed glances, nervous laughter, small talk, and an excessive consumption of booze. Speeches soon followed: made by the members of Western human rights organizations, of several NGO’s, and press corps. Some Iranian exile began trashing Iran, somehow loosely connecting it to the US elections. Someone else had a go at the Philippine’s anti-imperialist President Duterte. And of course, China was hit on several occasions, and so was Russia, particularly that ‘evil’ Putin. One after another, speakers mimicked Ms. Clinton’s derogatory pronunciation of Russian President’s name. No one mentioned Thailand or Indonesia even once. It was all grotesque and endlessly sad. Then the chest beating and insulting the voters slowly began… a slow masochistic public orgy. In the end, several well-behaved members of the public began queuing in front of the microphone, asking polite questions. Not sending the panelists to hell, not insulting them directly to their faces… Nothing like that! People were just asking non-confrontational questions, and then, patiently and politely waiting for replies. The ‘client’ states of the West were still very far from the rebellion. * Then my phone became extremely active, as I began receiving messages from all corners of the globe. From Sudan: “I never thought Donald would win! The Sudanese are making fun of Trump saying that he looks like our President Al-Basheer.” From Italy: “Better than Killary, but still disgusting”. From Uganda: “Our government is acting as if it didn’t back Hillary before the elections.” From Argentina: “Now in the US they will have to eat their own crap… as they made others eat it for decades.” From Indonesia: “Trump said that he would increase tariffs on imported products. In that case he’ll have to pay more for his suits, as he apparently wears some that are made in Indonesia”. * “Where were you on the 9-11?” Or now: “Where were you on 11-8?” Some people compare these two events. On both occasions (or before), no one bothered to listen, to face reality, and as a result, some terrible events took place. On 11-8 I was in Bangkok. On 9-11 in Hanoi, Vietnam, sipping coffee, and looking out of my window. The apartment was on a higher floor of the “Hanoi Tower”. The building was literally growing out from the old French prison, where Vietnamese patriots used to be tortured, raped and executed by the French colonialists. If I were to walk all the way towards the very glass panel, I would be able to see, far below, two shiny guillotines, preserved for people to remember the ‘great enlightened rule of the West over Asia’. Suddenly on the horizon, the sky lit up in a tremendous explosion of colors. The villages surrounding Hanoi were shooting firecrackers and makeshift rockets up to the sky. It was a great fireworks display, something I had never seen before. I turned my television set on. On the BBC coverage, two airplanes were flying, in slow motion, towards the towers of the World Trade Center. A few minutes later I received a phone call from my best friend in Santiago de Chile. “You would not believe what is happening here,” he reported to me, breathless. “People, total strangers, are stopping here, in the middle of the street. They are crying, falling into each other’s arms, and whispering: “Justice takes time, but it always comes!” They were referring to 9-11-1973, when the United States overthrew one of the oldest and greatest democracies on Earth. Chile was raped, its people murdered, its form of government and its economic model were shattered. A few hours after the “event”, both the Vietnamese and Chilean governments expressed their shock and support for the American people. In Vietnam, the celebrations were not reported. But they took place. Everyone knew it. The great anger against the Empire could be felt, and is still felt, not only in those two great nations, but also all over the world. People are outraged. Those in the United States are… and also those in the rest of the world are… although they are outraged for totally different reasons… but outraged they all are nevertheless! “Democracy” is the rule of people. It does not mean the ‘Western multi-party system’. It only means the ‘rule of the people’, in Greek. It can be based on the ancient ‘heavenly mandate’ on which the Chinese system is based even now. It can be the modern Latin American form of participatory democracy… as long as people are ruling. However, they are not ruling. Not in the West, nor in most of the countries of the rest of the world, where the governments are forced upon them by Western imperialism to defend their states and to often adopt very tough measures to do so. People in the United States had spoken, expressing their frustration and anger. People in the rest of the world were not asked who should be leading the world. The next, the most logical step for the world should now be, immediately to reject the leadership of both the United States and Europe. Brexit and 11-8 should be followed by the WORLD-EXIT. What does it mean? Simple: ‘Let the West eat its own shit, alone, finally’! And let the world be free from those governments and economic and colonialist concepts, which no one here (in Asia, Africa, Latin America or the Middle East) really elected and wants! Once we are at exiting, rejecting and defending, let’s also build huge protective walls around all non-Western countries. To defend them from the Crusaders and hordes that have been looting and plundering the entire Planet for centuries. The citizens of the United States have spoken. Oh yes! So let the rest of the world do the same! Let them vote on WORLD EXIT! It is clear what the result will be!

       "  'You Are Here: Home » Health News » Scientists Discover Exactly When a Woman’s Sex Drive Declines Scientists Discover Exactly When a Woman’s Sex Drive Declines Prev post Next post Sex is quite important to most middle-aged women, a fact established by a new study in the journal Menopause , which found that 75% of 1,390 middle-aged women reported sexual functioning to be moderately to extremely important. Women experience a notable decline in sexual function and sex drive approximately 20 months before and one year after their last menstrual period, and that decrease continues, though at a somewhat slower rate, over the following five years, according to a study led by a researcher at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center . Of note, in the natural menopause group the researchers found that race/ethnicity played a major role in the decline of sexual function, with African-American women experiencing a significantly smaller sex drive decline and women of Japanese descent experiencing a much greater decline when compared with white women. Key Sex Drive Study Findings \\nThe study, published ahead of print in the online issue of Menopause: The Journal of the North American Menopause Society , also found that various factors that frequently co-occur with menopause have less direct influence on declining sex drive and sexual function than menopause itself. \\n“Sexual functioning in women declines with age, and there has been much debate about how much this is due to menopause, aging or other physical, psychological or social factors,” said the study’s lead author, Nancy Avis, Ph.D., professor of public health sciences at Wake Forest School of Medicine, part of Wake Forest Baptist. “Our findings support that menopause has a negative effect on sexual functioning in many women.” \\nAdditionally, the study found that women who have a hysterectomy before the onset of menopause do not experience a marked decline in sexual function and sex drive immediately before undergoing the procedure but do so afterward, for as long as five years. \\nCommon issues known to accompany menopause, such as vaginal dryness, depression, and anxiety, didn’t explain the impact on sex drive, the researchers say. \\n“Sexual functioning is an important component of women’s lives. More than 75 percent of the middle-aged women in the SWAN study reported that sex was moderately to extremely important to them when the study began,” Avis said. “It is important for women and their health care providers to understand all the factors that may impact women’s experience of sex in relation to both the natural menopausal transition and hysterectomy, and we hope our findings will contribute to better understanding in this area.” A 31 Year Old Was Sick Of Expensive Rent And High Costs.

       "  \"\\nPosted by Martin Walsh | Oct 28, 2016 | Breaking News Julian Assange Can No Longer Remain Quiet \\nBarack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. \\nAfter all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. \\nBecause of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. \\nAn email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: “Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region” to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of “providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” Citing the need to “use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,” said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were “important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.” Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary’s largest donations come from those two countries. She Is Funded By Nations That Fund ISIS. Coincidence? \\nIn another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai , set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 “birthday check.” \\nThe email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would “welcome [the Clinton Foundation’s] suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health.” Desai added that while Qatar had already “allocated most of their $20 million … [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.” Bill Clinton gets $1M from Qatar for his birthday. FYI: It's legal and common practice in Qatar for husbands to beat and rape their wives. pic.twitter.com/oGM2Z9JrVl \\n— Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 13, 2016 \\nWe now see two more examples of the Clinton’s acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund ISIS. \\nFor those that do not see where the dots connect, let’s simplify how this all worked for Hillary. \\nHillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her “foundation.” These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups. \\nThat is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons. \\nThey are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS. \\nIt also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange. If Julian Assange is lying, why are they trying so hard to silence him? \\n— Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 23, 2016 \\nThe media remains silent on all of this. This would be plastered all over the news for months if a President Trump was exposed for this. \\nIgnorant politicians are not the problem. The problem is that ignorant people keep voting for them every election. This is the exact reason we desperately need change in this country, and it starts with Donald Trump. \\nPeople like Julian Assange have given up their lives to expose corruption in government and allowing Hillary Clinton to win this election makes all of his sacrifices meaningless. \\nHe has offered us a chance to revolt against our tyrannical government. Chances likes this do not occur often, and if we do not seize the opportunity, we will suffer another four years of suppression from our corrupt leaders. \\nVote Trump, so that we can save America and he can pardon Julian Assange. \"],\n",

       "  'By Whitney Webb at trueactivist.com\\nCyndy Coppola was arrested for standing on her own property as she tried to block Dakota Access Pipeline construction equipment from crossing her land.\\nOnce again, the repression of those against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is heating up, with 127 activists arrested in North Dakota over the weekend. However, North Dakota isn’t the only place where protests over the Dakota Access pipeline are coming to a head. In Iowa, farmers have had their land seized by the company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, through the use of eminent domain. Eminent domain has been legal in the US since 1888, thanks to the passage of the Condemnation Act . The law authorizes the federal government to take private property for public use. However, in 1906, the law was amended to allow for the seizure of private property even if it only benefited private parties (e.g., corporations), not the public. The argument for this was that corporate seizure of private land “helps” the public through economic development. Yet, what the law essentially means is that even your own land doesn’t belong to you if the government or government-supported corporations want it.\\nA sad, yet accurate example of eminent domain gone wrong took place last week in Calhoun County, Iowa. Cyndy Coppola was arrested over the weekend on her own property for trying to block access to DAPL trucks from hauling pipeline construction materials through her land. DAPL first received access to Coppola’s farm through the use of eminent domain, which granted Energy Transfer Partners easements to her property. Coppola remarked that watching the morally wrong seizure of the farm she worked so hard for was difficult to handle.'],\n",

They would lose billions in federal funding from that alone. If California were to secede, they would also guarantee that Republicans would effortlessly win the White House every four years. \\nCalifornia is also forgetting that the United States would tax them at very high rates on food, water, and everything else they need to survive. If California still wants to secede, then they can gear up and get ready for a war they will never win. \\nPresident Trump can alter the structure of the wall, as well. Should they officially secede, we can build a wall across their eastern and northern borders in order to isolate them off from the entire country.

Its specific purpose is to spread British values and the British view of the world abroad. It specifically, on its dozens of different national services, gives an opportunity to dissident voices who cannot get on their mainstream media. The Americans spend hundreds of millions annually on outfits like RFE/RL to do the same. Yet when the Russians do precisely the same thing on a much smaller scale, for example by enabling you to listen to me, this is portrayed as evil propaganda.\\nFortunately we have the Henry Jackson Society to defend you from it. The Henry Jackson Society, supported by Liam Fox, Jim Murphy and pretty well every other right wing enthusiast you can name, is of course a great believer in free markets. And its sense of the market has detected that its old product of a constant stream of Islamophobia is becoming dated, and currently buyers want Russophobia. Whatever your phobia, the Henry Jackson Society will have some to sell you, so here we have their new Manual of Russophobia .\\nWritten by Dr Andrew Foxall, Director of the Henry Jackson Society\\x92s so-called Centre for Russian Studies, has by brilliant research exposed the fact that Jeremy Corbyn, Seumas Milne, Tommy Sheridan and Colin Fox have all appeared on Russia Today television. And that a tiny group of left wingers I have never heard of once met in a pub with some Russian nationalists from the Ukraine. Funniest of all is the contention that CND is funded by the Russians.\\nGiven that the Henry Jackson Society is, and always has been, financed by CIA money laundered through American New World Order supporting private foundations, this is rather amusing. This pathetically thin hate manual is now on the desk of every Conservative and New Labour Progress Group MP.\\nIt is of course no coincidence that the overt security service operations operate in close co-ordination with the supposedly covert ones. The same day that the Henry Jackson Society paper was released, the head of MI5 gave an interview to the Guardian about the Russian threat. The Russians are not just coming, they are here! You can\\x92t see them because they are inside your laptop, where the Russian government apparently want to steal all your secrets. Our security services don\\x92t like the competition. That is their job.\\nApparently the Russians are out to steal Britain\\x92s industrial secrets, like how the Nissan Qasghqai is built or how the Chinese and French build Hinkley Point. I hope they don\\x92t get the blueprints of the new Dyson. Andrew Parker has of course to work hard as MI5 to find a new enemy. While he has yet again repeated the ludicrous claim that there are 3,000 Islamic terrorists in the UK, he must realise people will query the low productivity of these terrorists when it comes to killing anybody.\\nRussophobia has of course peaked in the US with Clinton\\x92s claims that it is Russia which is revealing her gross corruption and all her opponents are servants of Russia. She wants to face down Russia in Syria, in order to give it to the Islamic terrorists of whom Andrew Parker worries we have 3,000 in the UK. Clinton\\x92s claims of Russian involvement in hacking her entourage are totally unfounded, hence the lack of evidence. I am however surprised there have been no serious attempts to fabricate some.\\nWho benefits from this ratcheting up of anti-Russian rhetoric to hotter than cold war levels? Why the armaments and security industries, of course. Expect more donations to politicians and their foundations, and more pesky corruption investigations to be dropped by prosecuting authorities.\\nThe truth is that Russia is not our enemy. There is no chance that Russia will attack the UK or US. It has never happened and it never will. Nor is it remotely likely that Russia will attack any EU member state. The only thing that can make such a contingency even a 0.1% possibility, is the continuing gross anti-Russian rhetoric and propaganda and continued forward stationing of NATO assets.

       " ['NYT Admits Key Al Qaeda Role in Aleppo',\n",
       "  \"EDITOR'S CHOICE | 08.11.2016 NYT Admits Key Al Qaeda Role in Aleppo Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s As much as The New York Times and the mainstream U.S. media have become propaganda outlets on most foreign policy issues, like the one-sided coverage of the bloody Syrian war, sometimes the truth seeps through in on-the-ground reporting by correspondents, even ones who usually are pushing the “propo.” Such was the case with Anne Barnard’s new reporting from inside west Aleppo, the major portion of the city which is in government hands and copes with regular terror rocket and mortar attacks from rebel-held east Aleppo where Al Qaeda militants and U.S.-armed-and-funded “moderate” rebels fight side-by-side. Samantha Power, Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, addresses the Security Council meeting on Syria, Sept. 25, 2016. Power has been an advocate for escalating U.S. military involvement in Syria. (UN Photo) Almost in passing, Barnard’s article on Sunday acknowledged the rarely admitted reality of the Al Qaeda/”moderate” rebel collaboration, which puts the United States into a de facto alliance with Al Qaeda terrorists and their jihadist allies, fighting under banners such as Nusra Front (recently renamed Syria Conquest Front) and Ahrar al-Sham. Barnard also finally puts the blame for preventing civilians in east Aleppo from escaping the fighting on a rebel policy of keeping them in harm’s way rather than letting them transit through “humanitarian corridors” to safety. Some of her earlier pro-rebel accounts suggested that it wasn’t clear who was stopping movement of civilians through those corridors. However, on Sunday, she reported: “We had arrived at a critical moment, as Russia said there was only one day left to pass through a corridor it had provided for people to escape eastern Aleppo before the rebel side was flattened, a corridor through which precious few had passed. The government says rebels are preventing civilians from leaving. Rebels refuse any evacuation without international supervision and a broader deal to deliver humanitarian aid.” Granted, you still have to read between the lines, but at least there is the acknowledgement that rebels are refusing civilian evacuations under the current conditions. How that is different from Islamic State terrorists in Mosul, Iraq, preventing departures from their areas – a practice which the Times and other U.S. outlets condemn as using women and children as “human shields”– isn’t addressed. But Barnard’s crimped admission is at least a start. Barnard then writes: “Instead [of allowing civilians to move through the humanitarian corridors], they [the rebels] are trying to break the siege, with Qaeda-linked groups and those backed by the United States working together — the opposite of what Russia has demanded.” Again, that isn’t the clearest description of the situation, which is stunning enough that one might have expected it in the lede rather than buried deep inside the story, but it is significant that the Times is recognizing that Al Qaeda and the U.S.-backed “moderates” are “working together” and that Russia opposes that collaboration. She also noted that “Three Qaeda-linked suicide bombers attacked a military position with explosive-packed personnel carriers on Thursday, military officials said, and mortar fire was raining on neighborhoods that until now had been relatively safe. It was among the most intense rounds in four years of rebel shelling that officials say has killed 11,000 civilians.” While she then throws in a caveat about the impossibility of verifying the numbers, the acknowledgement that the U.S.-backed “moderate” rebels and their Al Qaeda comrades have been shelling civilians in west Aleppo is significant, too. Before this, all the American people heard was the other side, from rebel-held east Aleppo, about the human suffering there, often conveyed by “activists” with video cameras who have depicted the conflict as simply the willful killing of children by the evil Syrian government and the even more evil Russians. More Balance With the admission of rebel terror attacks on civilians in west Aleppo, the picture finally is put into more balance. The Al Qaeda and U.S.-backed rebels have been killing thousands of civilians in government-controlled areas and the Syrian military and its Russian allies have struck back only to be condemned for committing “war crimes.” The second plane about to crash into the World Trade Center towers in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001 Though the human toll in both sides of Aleppo is tragic, we have seen comparable situations before – in which the U.S. government has supported, supplied and encouraged governments to mount fierce offensives to silence rockets or mortars fired by rebels toward civilian areas. For instance, senior U.S. government officials, including President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, have defended Israel’s right to defend itself from rockets fired from inside Gaza even though those missiles rarely kill anyone. Yet, Israel is allowed to bomb the near-defenseless people of Gaza at will, killing thousands including the four little boys blown apart in July 2014 while playing on a beach during the last round of what the Israelis call “mowing the grass.” In the context of those deaths, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, who has built her career as a supposed humanitarian advocating a “responsibility to protect” civilians, laid the blame not on the Israeli military but on fighters in Gaza who had fired rockets that rarely hit anything besides sand. At the United Nations on July 18, 2014, Power said , “President Obama spoke with [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning to reaffirm the United States’ strong support for Israel’s right to defend itself…. Hamas’ attacks are unacceptable and would be unacceptable to any member state of the United Nations. Israel has the right to defend its citizens and prevent these attacks.” But that universal right apparently does not extend to Syria where U.S.-supplied rockets are fired into civilian neighborhoods of west Aleppo. In that case, Power and other U.S. officials apply an entirely different set of standards. Any Syrian or Russian destruction of east Aleppo with the goal of suppressing that rocket fire becomes a “war crime.” Perhaps it’s expected that the U.S. government, like other governments, will engage in hypocrisy regarding affairs of state: one set of rules for U.S. allies and another for countries marked for U.S. “regime change.” Statements by supposed “humanitarians”– such as Samantha Power, “Ms. R2P”– are no exception. But double standards are even more distasteful when they come from allegedly “objective” journalists such as those who work at The New York Times, The Washington Post and other prestige American news outlets. When they take the “U.S. side” in a dispute and become crude propagandists, they encourage the kind of misguided “group thinks” that led to the criminal Iraq War and other disastrous “regime change” projects over the past two decades. Yet, that is what we normally see. A thoughtful reader can’t peruse the international reporting of the U.S. mainstream media without realizing that it is corrupted by propaganda from both government officials and from U.S.-funded operations, often disguised as “human rights activists” or “citizen journalists” whose supposed independence makes their “propo” even more effective. So, it’s worth noting those rare occasions when The New York Times and the rest of the MSM let some of the reality peek through. When evaluating the latest plans from Hillary Clinton and other interventionists to expand the U.S. military intervention in Syria – via prettily named “safe zones” and “no-fly zones”– the American people should realize that they are being asked to come to the aid of Al Qaeda. \"],\n",

       " ['5 Things You Need to Know About the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests',\n",
       "  'By Nick Bernabe at theantimedia.org\\nA small Standing Rock Sioux site in North Dakota called the Sacred Stone Camp has been propelled into the national news narrative following their stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Due in part to independent media coverage of the ongoing standoff, the Sacred Stone camp has grown into a formidable opposition against the $3.8 billion, 1,200-mile long pipeline.\\nDue to misinformation coming from law-enforcement, political favoritism toward the pipeline builders, and the media’s blatant reluctance to report on the pipeline, it’s hard to tell truth from fiction. Anti-Media , along with our partners in the independent media and our embedded journalist at the opposition encampment, have been covering the unfolding standoff continuously. Here are five things you need to know.\\n1. Who is opposing the pipeline — and why The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is leading the opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. They have been joined by the largest tribal coalition in over 100 years in their stand against the pipeline. The coalition is also comprised of activists, allies, and environmentalists, collectively known as “water protectors,” at the Sacred Stone Camp, an encampment close to the location where the pipeline is planned to cross the Missouri River in North Dakota. According to the Sacred Stone camp website , they are opposing the pipeline because “[t]he Dakota Access threatens everything from farming and drinking water to entire ecosystems, wildlife and food sources surrounding the Missouri .”\\nThe Standing Rock Sioux also say the pipeline is violating treaty land , Sioux territory that was established many years ago by the federal government. “We will not allow Dakota Access to trespass on our treaty territory and destroy our medicines and our culture.”\\nThe opposition to the pipeline spreads across several states and is not opposed solely by Native Americans. Farmers, ranchers, and landowners are also opposed to the pipeline. Many of them have had their land taken from them against their will and given to the pipeline via eminent domain.\\n2. The U.S. government and the pipeline corporation are continuing a long tradition of disrespecting Native Americans\\nThe United States has a very bad reputation for treating Native Americans, the original inhabitants of this land, as less than human. In many instances in the past, the land where Native Americans lived was deemed to be of higher value than the Natives’ lives.\\nSuch has been the case in North Dakota — not only now, but in the past as well. According to The Atlantic :\\n“The land beneath the pipeline was accorded to Sioux peoples by the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868. Eleven years later, the U.S. government incited and won the Great Sioux War, and ‘renegotiated’ a new treaty with the Sioux under threat of starvation. In that document, the tribe ceded much of the Laramie land, including the Black Hills of South Dakota, where many whites believed there to be gold.”'],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nEvgeny Demin and Elena Demina moved from the Krasnodar Territory in southern Russia to Moscow with a small idea and big ambitions. In 2000, when they were not yet 25 years old, they founded SPLAT, a company that today supplies personal care and household chemical products to 45 countries around the world. \\n“In the beginning, the company specialized in the production of biologically active additives and cosmetics based on Spirulina platensis seaweed — thus the company name,” explains Evgeny Demin. \\nThey quickly decided to target their efforts in another direction: on the production of next-generation toothpaste. \\n“From the very start, we agreed to create the best toothpaste in the world, so that it would surpass all expectations,” he said. \\nEvgeny Demin and Elena Demina / Source: Press photo \\nThe couple first rented a factory for their operations near Moscow and in 2009 they opened their own plant 300 miles northwest of the Russian capital in the Novgorod Region. Today it employs more than 350 people. A total of 700 people work for the company, including in sales and marketing offices abroad. \\nThe company has opened a subsidiary and hired a local team in China and is now looking forward to working with its Chinese partners, according to SPLAT’s press service. The company’s premium products are particularly popular in Germany and SPLAT has also started to sell its products in France. The company currently owns more than 10 Russian and foreign patents. The right segment \\nFrom the very beginning SPLAT toothpaste was priced about twice that of its supermarket rivals. Entering the premium segment, where there were practically no competitors, was one of the factors of the brand’s success, says Alexander Yeremenko, managing director of the BrandLab marketing agency. \\nAccording to Yeremenko when SPLAT debuted, two major international players, Procter&Gamble and Colgate, had claimed the middle segment of the Russian market, while the lower end was dominated by Russian producers selling very cheap toothpaste. \\n“In the high-price segment, besides LACALUT, there were no important players,” Yeremenko said. \\nSource: Press photo \\nSome of SPLAT’s exclusive offerings include black toothpaste made from Karelian coal and golden toothpaste featuring extracts of diamond and colloidal gold. SPLAT’s scientific laboratory and R&D center in Moscow are in charge of developing the toothpaste’s unique components. \\nIn 2008 the company began exporting its products and by 2015 foreign sales made up 17 percent of its revenue. One of its most successful foreign markets is Turkey, where SPLAT was able to sign an exclusive contract with one of the country’s leading perfume and cosmetics chains. \\nThe company has opened a subsidiary and hired a local team in China and is now looking forward to working with its Chinese partners, according to SPLAT’s press service. The company’s premium products are particularly popular in Germany and SPLAT has also started to sell its products in France. The company currently owns more than 10 Russian and foreign patents. A personal approach to customer loyalty \\nThe company has not divulged any financial indicators, but in value terms SPLAT holds 9.7 percent of the Russian market and in terms of sales it has a 14.7-percent market share, says Timur Nigmatullin, an analyst at Finam Holding. \\nNigmatullin attributes SPLAT’s success in part to its unusual marketing strategy. The company does not employ TV advertising on principle and focuses its energies on repeat sales to loyal customers. \\nYeremenko believes that SPLAT’s marketing efforts were appropriate for a product in the high-end segment of the market where consumers value innovation and are ready to pay for it. \\n“SPLAT did not have money for promotion, which is why all efforts were directed at achieving a high-quality and innovative product,” Yeremenko said, adding that the firm’s unique offerings, such as being the first black toothpaste or having unusual taste and components are all elements of marketing, which requires constant research and experimentation. \\nThe company also takes a personal approach to encouraging brand loyalty. Each SPLAT toothpaste package contains a letter from Evgeny Demin himself, the firm’s general director. At the end of each letter, he provides his personal email address noting that he responds to all messages himself. \\n“The director’s letters in the packages create the impression of the producer’s responsibility to the customer; [they] guarantee a quality approach and the company’s excellent result on the market,” Yeremenko said. Not just toothpaste \\nToday SPLAT has diversified and it produces more than 200 different products from its 50,000 sq. ft. plant in the Novgorod Region. The company’s offerings include toothpastes, brushes, foams and mouthwashes, the BioMio ecological line of housekeeping products, the organic LALLUM Baby line of natural cosmetics for children and mothers and the HEYA series of natural shampoos and conditioners. \\nSource: Press photo \\nHEYA is one of SPLAT’s latest developments and is one of co-founder Elena Demina’s proudest accomplishments. \\n“The idea of creating products for health and hair beauty that would be just as unique and effective as all the other SPLAT products, came to us a long time ago,” she said. “Our team spent more than five years working on it.” \\nThe market for hair care products is highly competitive, but SPLAT’s offerings, made exclusively from natural ingredients without silicon or parabens, are unique. The company took its time developing the HEYA series components, but Demina says she is very happy with the result. \\n“We do not compete with other hair care producers because, all modesty aside, we believe that our products are unique and unrepeatable,” she said. \\nSource: Press photo \\nNigmatullin considers the Russian market robust and large enough to accommodate new products, despite the unfavorable economic situation and the difficult investment climate. \\n“The SPLAT phenomenon is not the only one,” Nigmatullin said. “There are many other examples: UAZ, Ural motorcycles, a long list of medicine produced in local plants, confectionery and so on.” \\nAccording to Yeremenko SPLAT’s success can be attributed to hard work and planning. \\n“Actually, SPLAT’s story is not as magical as it seems,” Yeremenko said. “It is proof of a solid marketing approach, which basically any producer can adopt.” \\nIn his view, SPLAT’s founders demonstrated sound judgment and perseverance in developing their idea. \\n“The problem with most Russian companies is not the lack of ideas, but that they don’t know where they’re going,” he said. “But SPLAT had a strategy and most importantly, it patiently implemented it.” Subscribe to get the hand picked best stories every week Related '],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nsott.net/news \\n© Bashir Khan Safi / Agence France Presse An Afghan man carries the dead body of a child following a NATO coalition airstrike on the outskirts of Kunduz on November 3, 2016. \\nScores of civilians, including children, have reportedly been killed in US airstrikes supporting a ground operation in Kunduz, Afghanistan, officials and media report. NATO forces in Afghanistan said the airstrikes were “to defend friendly forces under fire.” \\nEarlier on Thursday, United States Forces Afghanistan released a statement, saying that two US servicemen had died “as a result of wounds sustained during operations” in Kunduz. \\n“The service members came under fire during a train, advise and assist mission with our Afghan partners to clear a Taliban position and disrupt the group’s operations in Kunduz district,” the statement said. \\nResolute Support, a NATO-led training mission in Afghanistan, tweeted that the airstrikes in Kunduz had been carried out to defend “friendly forces under fire.” \\nBrigadier General Charles Cleveland, a spokesman for the United States military in Afghanistan, said that he couldn’t say whether the civilian deaths near Kunduz and the attack on US soldiers were related, but noted that the deceased American servicemen had been as advisers to an Afghan military operation. \\n“We have no evidence at this point of any civilian casualties, but we take all allegations very seriously,” he said, as cited by the New York Times . “Although this was an Afghan operation advised by US forces, US aircraft were used to defend all of the friendly forces.” \\nAfghan officials told Reuters that there had been heavy fighting between Taliban fighters and the US military about five kilometers from the city center. The US then reportedly called in airstrikes that resulted in numerous casualties. \\nLocal activists shared photos of what they say are dead bodies of the airstrike victims with RT. RT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the images. \\nGeneral Qasim Jangalbagh from the Kunduz police said the air raid had resulted in the deaths of about 26 people, AP reported. \\nKunduz’s provincial spokesman, Mahmood Danish, told AFP that the airstrikes had killed 30 civilians, including women and children. \\n“Afghan forces and coalition troops conducted a joint operation against the Taliban insurgents. In the bombardment 30 Afghan civilians were martyred and 25 others were wounded,” he said. \\nPolice spokesman Mahmoodullah Akbari gave similar toll to AFP, saying that infants as young as three months old were among the dead. \\nLocal activists shared photos of what they say are dead bodies of the airstrike victims with RT. RT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the images. \\n“They were asleep when their house came under attack by coalition troops,” Akbari said. \\nSafiullah Amiri, a member of the Kunduz Provincial Council, said at least 30 civilians had been killed in a series of airstrikes on the village, the NYT reported. The paper also cited Islamuddin Timoori, a representative of the protesters from Kunduz, who said that the bombing had been carried out by the US, killing 27 people and wounding 70. \\nAccording to Pajhwok, “the airstrikes and ground offensive” were conducted by “Afghan and foreign forces” in the Pul Achin and Poz Kandahari areas on the outskirts of Kunduz. \\nPajhwok reported that the airstrikes had prompted the citizens of Kunduz to take to the streets in protest. The protesters reportedly were carrying the bodies of people killed in the attack, including those of the children. Photos of the corpses of the alleged victims have been circulating on social media. \\n“I was working on the farm when suddenly the bombardment started in our area. When I came to my house seven members of my family, including women and children, were killed,” Kunduz resident Taza Gul told Pajhwok Afghan News. \\nBilal Sarwary, a local journalist citing sources in the Afghan government, reported that at least 31 civilians had been killed during an Afghan-NATO special forces operation on Thursday night. \\nCiting Afghan government sources, he tweeted that “Afghan and US Special forces were surrounded and were taking heavy fire when the airstrike was called.” Related '],\n",
       " ['War Crimes Accusations: Guess Who’s Talking | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World As the voices demanding to bring the sitting US administration to justice are getting l ouder, Washington is literally in panic, since it may soon be held responsible for hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths. These concerns have recently been intensified by Hillary Clinton’s electoral defeat, since it was obvious for the members of the Obama administration that would have been covering up those influential criminals along with the crimes they’ve committed. Since Hillary herself was heavily involved in the destruction of Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, she’s has a deep personal interest in obstructing justice. The “panicky mood” in the White House was intensified even further by the announcement of the International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda , who stated that the ICC would start investigating US war crimes in Afghanistan. Under these circumstances the White House has started pushing its corporate propaganda machine to vilify Moscow and Damascus, to divert the attention from the damage the US inflicted upon the countries of the region, including Iraq and Syria. Western journalists have been “recommended” to go down hard on Russia, Iran, Syria so that a regular reader would assume that the humanitarian catastrophe and the exodus of migrants from the Middle East is someone else’s fault. An extensive amount of attention has been drawn to the situation in Aleppo, as virtually all Western leafless would feature pictures of a Syrian girl allegedly rescued from the rubble “after the inhumane bombing” of Aleppo. However, a number of French-speaking sites, in particular, the Réseau international, Antipresse or Arrêt Sur Info have already declared those pictures a blatant manipulation, since the gild has been photographed in several places being carried by three different militants of the “white helmets” that are pretending to be rescuers during the day only to transform into Islamist insurgents as soon as the darkness falls. At the same time the Pentagon tried to downplay the amount of “collateral damage” that the the US Air Force inflicts in Iraq and Syria. In particular, according to the statement by the representative of the Central Command of the US Armed Forces, Colonel John Thomas, during the period from November 2015 to September 2016 a total of 64 civilians was killed by American air strikes in Syria and Iraq. However, one could hardly call this number “inaccurate”, since it’s a blatant lie. Last January a single US air strike in the Aleppo region resulted in 24 civilians killed and more than 40 injured. Later on a air strike against the Kurdish village of Sulsana resulted in 19 civilian deaths, among which one may find 3 minors. In July, the village of Tokhars was burying 45 adults and 11 children after a bombardment carried out by the US Air Force. Finally, the village of Hamir lost 9 people to American bombs, including 4 minors. The US Air Force claimed the lives of 167 civilians, including 17 women and 44 minors in the Syrian city of Manbij in the period from May to July. As for the Mosul assault, that is being heralded in the West as the greatest achievement of “allied forces” to date, it’s been a massacre. On March 20, as the result of a direct hit on the local University, American pilots left 92 civilians dead and 135 more injured. On April 18, the US Air Force destroyed a local tank farm , killing 150 civilians in the process. Finally, on October 21 a funeral procession came under fire in Daquq, leaving behind 21 dead bodies. The incredibly modest evaluation of the “collateral damage” that US Air Force inflicts upon the Middle Eastern population has been heavily criticized by the Amnesty International along with a number of various experts. The charts that White House present them with show one civilian is being killed in Iraq and Syria per 200 US air strikes… At the same time the Pentagon admits that in Afghanistan there was at least one civilian victim per every 15 air strikes, while the latest report from the White House shows that civilians are being killed each 5 flight against possible terrorist targets in such countries such as Pakistan and Yemen. If these figures are to be applied to the number of air strikes that the US carried out in Iraq and Syria, it will mean that during the US-led air strikes resulted in at least more than 300 civilians killed, while 2,750 civilians looks like a much more accurate number. The Amnesty International has analyzed the data provided by Syrian human rights activists and local monitoring organizations only to come to the conclusion that a total of 11 air strikes that the Pentagon would launch a total of 300 civilians is to be killed, while Washington would only acknowledge a single death, if any. In total, according to various estimates, in the Syrian conflict has already claimed the lives of more than 300 thousand people. Therefore, the White House strongly spins the hysteria about the alleged guilt of Russia and Damascus in the deaths of civilians Aleppo, without presenting any evidence, which brings us to the conclusion that this is nothing but a cheap trick used to shift the focus of the public attention from the unbelievable amount of “collateral damage” Washington has been inflicting on Syria illegally, since nobody has invited it. But, as the announcement about the International Criminal Court investigation shows, the war criminals are to be established and brought to justice, no matter how hard they may try to avoid the responsibility for their war crimes.

       " ['Going Guava: Why Your Hair Needs Guava Leaves',\n",
       "  'You Are Here: Home » Latest Posts » Going Guava: Why Your Hair Needs Guava Leaves Going Guava: Why Your Hair Needs Guava Leaves Prev post Page 1 of 2 Next \\nHair loss is becoming a more widely recognized condition in men and women across the country; by the time American men are 35 years old, about two-thirds will experience some degree of noticeable hair loss, with about 85 percent of men seeing a significant thinning of their hair by the time they are 50. The American Hair Loss Association notes that women, as well, experience hair loss, as a result of a number of different causes. As a result of these reasons, treatment for hair loss in women is not as readily available as it is for men. \\nTo remedy this, many individuals have turned to home remedies to prevent and treat hair loss, with varying results. One that has caught the attention of both hair loss patients and researchers in the past 20 years is the use of guava leaves. The sweet fruit, native to Mexico, Central and South America is a nutritious and delicious fruit that is increasingly being called a superfood because of it’s incredible contents and components. Why Guava Leaves for Hair Loss? \\nGuava leaf is extremely high in a variety of different types of vitamin B, including many of the nutrients needed for hair health. Thiamine: A deficiency of thiamine, or vitamin B1, can lead to hair loss , so it’s important to make sure that your diet for healthy hair includes thiamine. It’s a water-soluble vitamin that is included in many different hair products to maximize absorption in the scalp. Riboflavin: Vitamin B2 or riboflavin, is a building block vitamin that finds and repairs damaged cells, including the DNA that causes hair to thin and fall out. Cooking riboflavin can damage some of it’s health benefits, so it’s important to include the cooking fluid when using this vitamin for hair health. Niacin: Vitamin B3 helps to convert food into energy, and helps to increase the blood flow to the scalp and provide better nutrient and oxygen flow to the scalp. It enhances circulation and improves the structure and shape of the blood cells. Folate: Folic acid, or vitamin B9, can cause hair loss in individuals who are deficient in the nutrient. It also helps to form red blood cells. Pantothenic acid: A lack of vitamin B5 can cause hair loss by weakening the hair follicles. When you have enough, your scalp can help the follicles work properly, relieve the flaking and itching that come along with dandruff, and can encourage new hair growth. Pyridoxine: Vitamin B6 is vital for converting testosterone into the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that attacks hair follicles. A deficiency of vitamin B6 can cause an increase in DHT and can cause hair loss. Vitamin A: This fat-soluble antioxidant protects hair follicles from damage done by free radicals, and helps cells reproduce — including the cells necessary for hair growth and maintenance. Deficiencies can cause your hair to become dry and brittle, and may be the reason for hair breaking at the ends or roots. Antimicrobial benefits: Guava leaves have been shown to have many different antimicrobial properties that can help to combat any infections or skin conditions that can cause hair loss. They clear up the remnants of the bacteria on the scalp and help to heal the skin, which allows healthy hair to grow. \\nGuava, also known as guyaba, also has high levels of vitamin C — more than in most citrus fruits. It’s got a rich content of flavonoids, like quercetin, polyphenols, and other important plant chemicals. It is often made into jams and jellies a process made easier because of the high levels of pectin, a dietary fiber, that may play a role in root hair growth and cellular function. Other Health Benefits of Guava Leaves: Diabetes: In east Asia, individuals are using guava leaves to treat diabetes due to the anti-hyperglycemic properties of the extract. In Japan, for example, Guava Leaf Tea, or Bansoureicha, has been approved as a Food for Specified Health Use and is commercially available to help individuals lower elevated blood glucose, along with other conditions. The approval in Japan took place in 2000 as a result of several studies showing the ability of the Guava Leaf Tea to effectively help to combat high blood glucose and sugar intake for individuals with Type 2 diabetes or experiencing pre-diabetic symptoms. High Cholesterol: A 1993 study shows that in a single-blind trial, 145 men ate a similar diet, with 72 taking a soluble fiber and increased-potassium diet that included guava. Following four months of monitoring, the individuals who consumed the guava experienced a reduced blood pressure and decrease in calcium and triglycerides. As a result of the high potassium and soluble fiber content of guava, the fruit may be an effective way to lower high blood pressure and blood lipids. Diarrhea: In some studies , guava has been shown to block some of the pathogens that cause diarrhea. While there hasn’t been extensive research done and published in peer-reviewed journals, there is some evidence that guava leaf extract has helped to improve the number of daily stools, the duration, pain, and spasms in patients with infantile viral enteritis. It’s believed that the components of guava leaf can smooth muscle fibers, which prevents the movement of the intestines and capillary permeability. Other health benefits: Many claims and studies have been done that show at least some positive effect in everything from weight loss and metastatic cancers to staph infections and common colds. Again, extensive research hasn’t been conducted, but these early studies show that there is at least some connection between guava leaves and improved health.

       " ['Russia or the Neocons: Who endangers American democracy? | OffGuardian',\n",
       "  'by Vladimir Golstein, via The Duran \\nPolitical discourse of American mass media is inundated with another wave of Russophobia and fear mongering. Besides the obvious military threat (Russia’s nuclear arsenal), or the challenges to the US foreign policy (the conflicts in Ukraine or Syria), a new fear has been introduced into the news: the US political system is endangered by Russia’s computer hacking, informational warfare, and its support of Donald Trump. \\nThe newspaper titles sound like a commercial for the upcoming Invasion of the Body Snatchers sequel. The Washingon Post announces: “Russia Is Now a Threat. The US Should Treat It Like One.” Time magazine raises the stakes: “Russia Wants to Undermine Faith in the U.S. Election.” \\nThe Atlantic warns of the “The Dangers of the Putin-Trump relationship,” articulating the already familiar litany of complaints: “Russia is directly interfering in the US elections … it is a dangerous escalation that threatens the integrity of the US electoral process.” While US Today allows notorious neocon named Max Boot to discover not just the threat, but an actual war. His “Time to Get Real About Russia Cyber War,” is rather blunt: “Our democracy is under attack by Russia, but almost no one is treating the situation with the gravity it deserves.” \\nWell, nobody treats the situation with the gravity it deserves because they are treating it with much greater gravity. In fact, some of the commentators are so grave, that they are ready to give in already. Zack Beauchamp concludes his tirades against Russian hacking in the following manner: “Russia’s strategy is even more dangerous that it appears. Not only does it undermine democracy using the press but it actually gets the press to undermine itself. And there’s not much we can reasonably do about it, either.” \\nReading all this, one might think that the former Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal , has been resurrected along with his 1949 battle-cry: “The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming. They’re right around. I’ve seen Russian soldiers.” \\nWhat is behind this Russophobia? A real Russian threat? A smokescreen intended to cover failed policies of recent administration? The meeting between the Russophobic minds of a particular candidate (Hillary Clinton) and a particular group of voters (neocons)? \\nI believe that these Joe McCarthy type accusations against both Russia and Trump seem to pursue only one goal: to give the veneer of respectability to the neocons’ and other Republican luminaries’ desertion of their own party. Thus, endless “confessions” of reformed Republicans and hardcore neocons , expressing their born-again zeal for the Democratic Candidate, Hillary Clinton. \\nThe neocons are not switching parties because they’ve seen the light. They are enamored with Hillary Clinton’s record of foreign policy and her willingness to embrace the US globalist claims. As reported by Rania Khalek in Intercept , Robert Kagan, one of the leading neocons, the co-founder of the notorious PNAC (Project for the New American Century, the blueprint of the recent policies of aggression and regime change intended to cement US hegemony in world affairs), has been on the record for quite some time: “I would say all Republican foreign policy professionals are anti-Trump,” Kagan told …at a “ foreign policy professionals for Hillary ” fundraiser… –I would say that a majority of people in my circle will vote for Hillary.” \\nThe neocons are very public about their desertion, and bear it as a badge of honor. Dubious honor, since in their pursuit of an ideal candidate for their agenda, neocons do not just betray their former party, but the very foundations of American democracy: the two party system. \\nTheir desertion reveals that American political system has finally internalized Francis Fukuyama proud words about the end of history. We’ve reached the consensus; there is no need to argue or challenge, history has ended, the truths are revealed and they are now the property of the elites united into one globalist Imperial party bent on equating American prosperity with the American hegemony over world affairs. \\nTo any objective observer it is clear that is not Russia that endangers US democracy but the political corruption, the rule of 1% oligarchy, and mad pursuit of PNAC policies. Even greater danger to democracy lies in the neocons’ desertion to the Hillary camp. \\nUnsavory as the corporate rule and globalism might be, one can argue for and pursue these goals, provided they leave the room for the alternative vision. It is this neocons’ dismissal of the alternatives that betrays the very foundations of democracy, at least, in the way, a political philosopher Karl Popper formulated them in his celebrated 1945 treatise, Open Society and Its Enemies . \\nThe list of neocons and other prominent Republicans rushing toward one party system has been compiled by Eleanor Clift in Daily Beast at the end of June, and had obviously grown since then. Some of them, Max Boot in particular, are pretty explicit about the reasons for his desertion: in his May 8, 2016, article in LA Times , Boot announces simply that, “The Republican Party is Dead.” \\nWhy? Because it is no longer led by the likes of McCain, Rubio and Romney, for whom Boot served as foreign policy advisor, but by Donald Trump, “the ignorant demagogue” intending to break up “the most successful alliance in history — NATO.” Furthermore, Trump has “kind words for tyrants such as Vladimir Putin.” Indeed, how can anyone in the US political establishment have kind words for Putin? We keep our kind words only for “our SOBs.” \\nThe simplicity if not poverty of this argumentation makes it difficult to distinguish it from exaggerations, simplification, or ignorance, for which neocons consistently fault Trump. But neocons were never friends of irony; otherwise, they would not make statements about NATO’s spectacular success with a straight face. \\nThe alliance that followed every whim of its paranoid members, such as Baltic Republics or Poland, and which intended to drag Ukraine into NATO pushing the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation? If this is success, how does one define failure? And talking about exaggerations: “The risk of Trump winning, however remote, represents the biggest national security threat that the United States faces today.” \\nAs if being “dead” is not bad enough, Boot feels the need to drive a stake into the heart of the Republican Party: the party is stupid . Writing for NYT , the publication that never misses a chance to print something nasty about Republicans, Boot bemoans Republican complicity with Donald Trump phenomenon: “How the Stupid Party’ Created Donald Trump.” \\nWhy can’t there be an alternative to the neocons’ doctrines of world domination in the form of a populist, nationalist movement that wants Americans to take care of Americans first, before overextending the country’s economic and military reach? And should this alternative be immediately called stupid? \\nYet, for many neocons, it is Hillary or bust. James Kirchik goes out of his way trying to convince his fellow conservatives that it is Clinton who is a true conservative, and therefore, the last American hope: “It’s come to this: Hillary Clinton is the one person standing between America and the abyss.” \\nReferring to a profound conservative thinker, Michael Oakeshott, Kirchik observed that Oakeshott “defines the conservative disposition as one that ‘prefers small and limited innovations to large and indefinite’ ones and ‘favors a slow rather than a rapid pace, and pauses to observe current consequences and make appropriate adjustments.’ … Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, something that conservatives, by definition, are supposed to uphold.” \\nKirchick fails to mention, however, that it is Clintons’ and Obama’s implementation of neocons’ policies which is nothing short of revolutionary. Military adventures, drastic regime changes, alliance redrawing, the willingness to sacrifice American lives and money in their pursuit, all these misguided policies that meet no political resistance –that’s what revolutionary. \\nTrump’s realism and pragmatic approach to politics appears as revolutionary only to the ideologues who refuse to pause in their drive to reshape the modern world according to their childish dreams. \\nThis radical reworking of democratic and conservative process of slow incremental improvements into the hegemony of corporate sponsored elites is indeed revolutionary: a modern day version of Lenin’s hegemony of proletariat and its avant-garde, the elite party, all over again. \\nHillary Clinton is as conservative as Brezhnev, who, in his failure to modify or change the radical agenda set up by the party of Lenin and Stalin, was indeed, a conservative. Only an intellectual of Kirchick’s magnitude can see something Oakeshottian in this embrace of one party system. \\nAs someone who lived under one party rule in the former Soviet Union, I fully appreciate Popper’s rather minimalistic, but fundamental view of democracy, as the society that boasts a two party system and which guarantees the ease of deposing a ruling party in case of its failures. \\nKarl Popper insisted on the necessity and practical usefulness of the two-party system, so that the loss of power would lead to self-scrutiny and therefore improvement. While the two parties and their loyal press try to police each other, they keep each other busy, allowing the rest of the citizens to live in peace and pursue their goals without too much interference or control. \\nObviously, all this goes down the drain with the one party system of globalists and the elites, the party that mocks and dismisses as ridiculous or deplorable anyone who happens to challenge it. \\nIn his The Open Society and its Enemies Popper proposes a rather paradoxical, yet extremely sensible theory of a democratic society. What is important for Popper, is not the discovery of a perfect government, but a much more mundane and pragmatic question: how to avoid the blatantly bad ones. And democracy does it better than any other system. Insisting on this pragmatism, Popper highlights the following syllogism: \\nAnd we do not base our choice on the goodness of democracy, which may be doubtful, but solely on the evilness of a dictatorship, which is certain. Not only because the dictator is bound to make bad use of his power, but because a dictator, even if he were benevolent, would rob all others of their responsibility, and thus of their human rights and duties. This is a sufficient basis for deciding in favor of democracy—that is, a rule of law that enables us to get rid of the government. No majority, however large, ought to be qualified to abandon this rule of law.” \\nPopper wrote this elucidation for The Economist ; where he explains his paradoxical thought in the following manner: \\nIn ‘The Open Society and its Enemies’ I suggested that an entirely new problem should be recognized as the fundamental problem of a rational political theory… how can we best avoid situations in which a bad ruler causes too much harm? \\nWhen we say that the best solution known to us is a constitution that allows a majority vote to dismiss the government, then we do not say the majority vote will always be right. We do not even say that it will usually be right.” \\nFor Popper, the two-party system is a requirement not because any of these parties possesses the truth, but because they can lose, be removed from power, and thus given a chance to think things through and improve. Consequently, it is the very possibility of losing, and therefore improving, that makes democracies dynamic and progressive: \\nFrom the point of view of the new theory, Election day ought to be a Day of Judgment. As Pericles of Athens said in about 430 BC, ‘although only a few may originate a policy, we are all able to judge it.’ Of course, we may misjudge it; in fact, we often do. But if we have lived through a party’s period of power and have felt its repercussions, we have at least some qualifications for judgment…In order to make a majority government probable, we need something approaching a two-party system…. for such a system encourages a continual process of self-criticism by the two parties.” \\nFor Popper, the two –party system is preferable since “an inclination to self-criticism after an electoral defeat is far more pronounced in countries with a two-party system than in those where there are several parties.” It is this self-criticism of a losing party; this desire to reform and modernize that provides healthy development for democracies. \\nThe rule of the last two decades did not improve the economic life of the majority of Americans; in fact, it resulted in the drastic redistribution of wealth. It didn’t bring peace to the world stage. In fact, we are standing on the threshold of nuclear confrontation. \\nYet, in the manner of the Germany in 1930s, we are rapidly overstepping democratic principles for the sake of one party and its global ambitions, of the consensus formulated by the PNAC, Council of Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Council, and other think tanks, along with the State Department, and the press, all of whom argue for the same policies all over again. Even now, weeks before the elections, we are reading about the same bureaucrats in Pentagon, CIA, or State Department, haggling for the place in the future Hillary cabinet. \\nIt is those rascals that can be sent home, who are worthy of being voted in. And conversely, it is those rascals, who want to stay in power no matter how wrongheaded, dangerous, or unpopular their policies are that should be thrown out. \\nThere is no absolute truth in politics, there is no end of history, and there is no one size fits all. Popper understood it much better than Fukuyama. History never ends: parties should continue to lose, and thus given a chance to come up with better policies for the next election. Only when Democratic Party is forced to take a back seat, it will contemplate on how it can improve, and offer new policies for the country. \\nPropping up Hillary as the best embodiment of the failed policies, allowing the same bankers, diplomats, and generals to metastasize into next election and hold the same key positions in the Pentagon, the State Department, CIA or Treasury, is ultimately, the embrace of one party system; it provides a profound disservice to the United States and its democratic tradition. \\nAt the last presidential debate this electoral season, Hillary Clinton pretended to be appalled by Trump’s hypothetical refusal to accept the results of the November elections. Mass media echo chambers went into the override mode bemoaning Trump’s disrespect for the venerable political tradition of peaceful transition of power. Trump was never in power, however. \\nWhat is truly appalling is the real, not the hypothetical threat of turning US into a one party system, the system which is so entrenched that it can only mock, dismiss, and conspire to denigrate its opponents.

       " ['BREAKING: We Caught Obama Spending 30 Million Dollars Against Trump To Rig This Election | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'Email Print It’s no secret that Obama and his puppets are doing everything they possibly can to rig the election against Trump. Positive Trump polls are coming all the time, so it’s all hands on deck from the Democrats to do whatever it takes to hand the election to Hillary. Obama’s latest move involves registering immigrant voters who will most likely be voting for Hillary in November and he’s spent TONS of your taxpayer money doing it. From Judicial Watch : Months after the Obama administration spent $19 million to register new immigrant voters that will likely support Democrats in November, it’s dedicating an additional $10 million in a final push as the presidential election approaches. The money is distributed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Homeland Security agency that oversees lawful immigration, to organizations that help enhance pathways to naturalization by offering immigrants free citizenship instruction, English, U.S. history and civics courses. Officially, they’re known as “citizenship integration grants.”[…] Judicial Watch went on to say… The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been aggressive in promoting its citizen integration grant program this year, offering large sums to recruit new groups that can offer immigrants the services they need to become citizens. Clearly, the ultimate goal is qualifying as many immigrants as possible to vote since they tend to cast ballots for Democrats. “We intend to award about $1 million to first-time recipients in the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program for fiscal year 2016,” the agency’s grant announcement states. “If you represent one of these organizations, or know of an interested organization, we strongly encourage that organization to consider applying. Additionally, another $9 million will fund programs that provide both citizenship instruction and instruction and naturalization application services.” Some might consider this a cash giveaway.[…] Practically every federal agency is participating in the effort by contributing resources and creating programs to help immigrants. For example the Department of Labor (DOL) is implementing “new workforce programs” for the “new Americans” and the Department of Education is promoting “funding opportunities” to assure that the immigrants “are provided the tools they need to succeed.” The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is collaborating with other agencies to release a career and credentialing toolkit on “immigrant-focused career-pathways programs.” The Department of Justice (DOJ) and USCIS are making sure the new Americans have worker rights and protections and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is launching a two-year pilot to assure that non English speakers have “meaningful access to housing programs” subsidized by American taxpayers. Obama likes to pretend that he’s doing this for the greater good of America, but the truth is it’s just part of the overall agenda to do whatever it takes to make sure Democrats run Washington and continue to drive our country into the ground.

       "  'Military An American soldier talks with Saudi troops. (File photo by the US Army) \\nA US congressman has warned that American troops could be prosecuted for providing military support to the Saudi war on Yemen. \\nTed Lieu made the warning in a letter to US Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, saying the US government’s denial of target selection for Saudi airstrikes in Yemen does not excuse Washington from legal responsibilities. \\n“I find it deeply troubling that the US apparently has no advanced knowledge of what targets will be struck by jets that are refueled by US personnel with US tankers,” Lieu said in his letter. \\n“The US would appear to be violating LOAC [laws of armed conflict] and international standards by engaging in such direct military operations if US personnel are not aware if targets are civilian or military, if the loss of life and property are disproportional, or if the operation is even militarily necessary,” he noted. A Yemeni boy walks past a mural depicting a US drone and reading: \"Why did you kill my family.\" (Photo by AFP) \\nPointing to the 18-month involvement of the US in Saudi war on the Yemeni people, the Democratic congressman stressed that Washington had knowledge of a bombardment campaign hitting civilian targets, including schools and hospitals, multiple times. \\n“US personnel are now at legal risk of being investigated and potentially prosecuted for committing war crimes. Under international law, a person can be found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes. Under US law, a person can be found guilty for conspiring to commit war crimes,” Lieu wrote. \\nThe Pentagon has been providing logistic and surveillance support to Saudi Arabia in its military aggression against Yemen, the kingdom’s impoverished southern neighbor, which has killed more than 10,000 Yemenis since its onset in March 2015. \\nThe unprovoked war started by a coalition of Saudi-allies in an attempt to undermine the Houthi Ansarullah movement and reinstate former Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, a staunch ally of the Riyadh regime. \\nWashington has on several occasions criticized the Saudi regime for its crimes against humanity in Yemen, but has shown no sign of ending its support for Riyadh.

       " ['Chris Matthews Sounds Alarm On Trump Presidency In Chilling Warning To Americans (VIDEO) – New Century Times',\n",
       "  'Share on Facebook \\nOne of the biggest reasons Donald Trump was able to win enough votes to take over the White House was his relentless attacks of corruption against Hillary Clinton, all while the media virtually ignored the accusations of corruption against Donald Trump. In fact, it’s looking more and more likely that by his very first day in office, Donald Trump will be the most corrupt president ever. \\nMSNBC’s Chris Matthews and MSNBC’s Chief Legal Analyst, Ari Melber are among several who are beginning to wake up to the reality that Trump plans on using the presidency in the very worst way possible, in a way that would have the Founding Fathers rolling in their graves. Our first self-described billionaire President Elect plans on using the presidency to make himself and his family even more wealthy. \\nOne of the biggest problems, as Matthew sees it, is that Trump wants to give his children national security clearance and everything that goes along with it, all while letting them take the reigns of the Trump fortune. This is illegal in so many ways. \\nAs Melber points out, hiring family was banned in an anti-nepotism law passed in 1967. Proponents of the law were especially concerned because a President should be free to fire staff and cabinet members, but that can be tough to do if staff or cabinet members are family. Trump’s workaround for the nepotism law, though, is to not give his family members official titles, but still, he hopes to include them in his decision making processes and let them sit in on critical meetings. \\nHere’s the thought and anger provoking video: \\nWhile Matthews’ and Melber’s discussion was mostly theoretical, there are already real-life consequences to Trump’s glaring conflicts of interests. \\nThe Washington Post on Friday reported that about 100 foreign diplomats are trying to curry favor with the Trump administration by booking rooms in Trump’s Washington DC hotel, sometimes at rates of up to $20,000 a night. If you recall, the Clinton Foundation was accused of offering access in exchange for donations. The evidence that that ever happened was weak, but still, it was something that Trump didn’t let go of during his entire campaign. The idea that Trump would be hosting diplomats, in his hotel, to profit his company, is way beyond anything Clinton is accused of. \\nThat’s not even the tip of the iceberg. While he did settle the Trump University fraud case, Trump apparently Underreported: \\nTrump owes millions to Deutsche Bank \\nwhich is being fined for $14 billion by DoJ \\nwhich Trump will oversee as POTUS pic.twitter.com/vd724yNjYZ \\n— Adam Khan (@Khanoisseur) October 7, 2016 \\n” target=”_blank”>owes millions to Deutsche Bank, a bank which is being fined by the Department of Justice. Will Trump drop the fines in exchange for Deutsche Bank dropping their claim? Perhaps Trump will uncharacteristically take the high road (doubtful), but no president should have that power to begin with. \\nI’m sure as we turn over even more rocks, we’ll find far more conflicts of interest and evidence that Trump only ran for office for personal enrichment. \\nThere’s a reason elected officials are supposed to put all their assets into blind trusts (and handing them over to their kids is the exact opposite of a blind trust). Governments are not in the business of making money. Trump is. That’s a conflict of interest and it should be deemed unacceptable by all Americans. '],\n",

       "  'You Are Here: Home » Health & Wellness » 4 Motivation-Zapping Thoughts To Identify and Eliminate 4 Motivation-Zapping Thoughts To Identify and Eliminate Prev post Next post \\nby Elizabeth Seward – Staff Writer \\nI often tell myself that the only difference between an idea and an accomplishment is action. I repeat this to myself regularly because I believe it; I believe in the power of action. Most people fully understand the importance of action, no matter how unproductive they might be. \\nThe difficulty is often in finding the motivation to initiate action. Not everyone is born naturally motivated, but we all need this driving force behind us if we’re going to succeed in doing just about anything we dream of doing. In fact, much of our life trajectory depends on our ability to harness motivation so that it yields action. Are you killing your own motivation? \\nIf you catch yourself entertaining any of the motivation-zapping thoughts below, stop that unhelpful voice in your head dead in its tracks and reset! What I Want Is For Other People, Not Me. I’ve been an artist all of my life. Ever since I was a child, I wanted to make “a living” out of creating, and thus, all of my life, I occasionally come across people who try to convince me that the life of an artist is one for rich folks or crazy people or beautiful elites or some other kind of person that just isn’t me. Luckily, I haven’t spent much time listening to those people. However, every once in a while, especially if I’m already feeling down, that thought pattern will make its way into my head. Learn this now: no matter your background, you are entitled to the opportunity to work toward what you want. I Don’t Have The Resources. Maybe you think you don’t have the time, the energy, the right space, the money, or any other type of resource or support you need to put your ideas into action. And maybe you’re right. But be honest with yourself: it’s more likely that you’re just making excuses. There are solutions to most problems like these, so find them and embrace them. Improve your time management skills, get some help with your other tasks (delegate!), secure the space and equipment you need – even if you have to borrow it, pinch pennies, find financing, look for a new job, exercise daily for an energy boost – just do whatever it takes. If the idea is important enough to you, you’ll find a way to uplift it with action. I’ll Do It Eventually. There is no eventually. There is no guarantee that you will be here tomorrow. If you can begin today, get the show on the road! Meet this motivation-zapping thought with rebellion and give your idea the green light today. I’m Not Good Enough. Maybe you think you don’t have the talent, intelligence, or charisma it takes to bring your idea into fruition? Think again. The biggest thing standing between you and your goal is not your raw skill, but your willingness to actively participate in your own idea. As they say, showing up is half of the battle (I think it’s most of the battle). Most people who are good at something didn’t get that way without practice. You have to begin cutting your teeth somewhere! The main reason others might be more skilled than you are at something specific is because they do it regularly and you do not. There are exceptions, of course, but this is usually the case. 3 Common Vegetable Garden Planning Mistakes \\nAre you planning a vegetable garden?

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia was successfully re-elected, despite vocal criticism from human rights organizations. The 47 places on the council are distributed on a regional basis, with staggered elections seeing a third of the body re-elected each year. Russia had finished its three-year term, and was running against Hungary and Croatia for the two available seats from Eastern Europe. \\nThe decision was close, and came down to just two votes: with Hungary far ahead, Croatia received the votes of 114 of the 193 member countries, and Russia was selected on 112 ballots. \\n\"It was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We\\'ve been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in,\" Russia\\'s UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said quoted by RT . Russia is eligible to run next year, against a new set of countries. \\nAhead of this year’s vote Russia came under concerted pressure from human rights organizations. “The non-election of Russia shows that the nations of the world can reject gross abusers if they so choose,” said executive director Hillel Neuer. “This makes the election of Saudi Arabia, China and Cuba even more preposterous.” \\nAs we reported earlier this week , a petition signed by 80 NGOs, including Human Rights Watch and Refugees International, asked the voting countries to \"question seriously whether Russia\\'s role in Syria which includes supporting and undertaking military actions which have routinely targeted civilians and civilian objects renders it fit to serve on the UN\\'s premier inter-governmental human rights institution.\" Russia dismissed the petition, published this week, as “cynical” and “dishonorable,” and said the accusations were motivated more by politics than by concern for human rights. Moscow, which has been conducting airstrikes in the country over the past year, says that it is acting legally, following an official call for assistance from the Syrian government, and insists that its war efforts are targeted at terrorists. \\nHowever, most perversely, in what was clearly a politically-motivated choice, Saudi Arabia sailed through the Asian regional ballot with 152 votes, and will sit on the UNHRC alongside China, Japan and Iraq for the next three years.

Until now, her story has been swept under the rug by a news media which has always been deferential to President Obama. \\nMs. Kirchner told the story of how Argentina was visited by the White House in November 2010, with a secretive and unusual request. A full English translation of her speech is available here. \\nDuring the time the event took place, Obama had just faced a stinging rebuke in midterm elections which saw a Republican takeover of the House, led by the insurgent Tea Party. The results of that election were a direct threat to Obama’s mandate. Wikipedia describes the incredible upset this way: \\nRepublicans regained control of the chamber they had lost in the 2006 midterm elections, picking up a net total of 63 seats and erasing the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. Although the sitting U.S. President’s party usually loses seats in a midterm election, the 2010 election resulted in the highest loss of a party in a House midterm election since 1938, and the largest House swing since 1948. This also happened to be the Republicans’ largest gain in House seats since 1938. \\nUnder the shadow of this election, Obama became concerned about the possibility of being a one-term president and leaving a damaged legacy. He had not been able to accomplish any notable achievements as president, and the economy was still reeling from the aftershocks of the 2008 real estate and stock market crashes. Obama Was Desperate for a Deal with Iran \\nObama had been negotiating with Iran regarding their nuclear ambitions, and the world was watching. But negotiations had bogged down, with then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad insisting on the need for nuclear fuel as part of the deal. \\nAccording to Kirchner, the Obama White House intended to sidestep congressional approval and media scrutiny by quietly hatching a scheme where third party nations would supply the fuel. \\nShe told the UN Assembly that Argentina was approached by a representative of Obama’s White House, Gary Samore, who at the time served as the top adviser on nuclear issues. \\n“Gary Samore had explained to our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Héctor Timerman, that negotiations were underway for the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease with its uranium enrichment activities or to do it to a lesser extent but Iran claimed that it needed to enrich this Tehran nuclear reactor and this was hindering negotiations. They came to ask us, Argentines, to provide the Islamic Republic of Iran with nuclear fuel.” said Kirchner. \\nShe went on to explain that Mr. Samore presented the following options: \\nThe simplest and quickest one was for Argentina to provide the new nuclear fuel, as the original fuel had been designed by Argentina, who owned the intellectual property rights. \\nAnother alternative was for Argentina to authorize Russia to supply the uranium, following the Argentine design. \\nThe last alternative was for the United States or some other country with nuclear capacity to replace the operating core of the nuclear reactor with a new one using other non-Argentine fuel. \\nPresident Kirchner was willing to help, but the issue was politically tricky. Argentina had been the original producer of the nuclear fuel used in the Tehran reactor, and held intellectual property claims to the material. However, there was ongoing tension between Iran and Argentina due to a terrorist bombing in 1994. \\nThe AMIA bombing was an attack on the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building. It occurred in Buenos Aires on 18 July 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. It was Argentina’s deadliest bombing ever. The Bombing of the AMIA Building was the Deadliest in Argentina’s History \\nAfter a long series of incompetent and corrupt investigations into the incident, in 2005 Argentine prosecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Martínez Burgos formally accused the government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the Hezbollah militia of carrying it out. According to the prosecution’s claims in 2006, Argentina had been targeted by Iran after Buenos Aires’ decision to suspend a nuclear technology transfer contract to Tehran \\nArgentina’s justice, Israel, and the United States suspected in 2005 that Hezbollah was behind the attack, with backing from Iran. Hezbollah has denied responsibility. The Iranian government maintains its innocence, condemning the terrorist attack and calling for urgent punishment of those responsible. \\nAfter many years spent on the case, Special Prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead in his home, on January 18, 2015. His body was discovered just six hours before he was due to explain his findings to congress. The official cause of death was a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, but there is a haze of suspicion surrounding the case. Argentinians March in Protest of the Lack of Justice for the AMIA Bombing \\nTo this day the bombing case remains unresolved, and Iran has refused to extradite any of the suspects involved. \\nPresident Kirchner continued with her address to the UN, explaining that she attempted to follow standard protocol and receive the White House request in writing: \\nYou know that Argentina is a member of the select club of nuclear energy producing countries but that we occupy, nonetheless, a leading position in the field of non-proliferation. This means that non-nuclear proliferation is also a matter of governmental interest to us as well. \\nI said as much to my Minister of Foreign Affairs who in turn relayed this to the White House’s envoy, Gary Samore that we would accept to provide the fuel because it was in the hands of Argentina since 1987 and we also had the technique to produce it in exchange, obviously, for such request to be submitted in writing and signed. This message was conveyed and I believe that was the last time, after that communication, that our Minister of Foreign Affairs saw Gary Samore. \\nSo, after her demand that the request for nuclear fuel be provided on the official record, the U.S. representative vanished and the issue was never mentioned to Kirchner again. This shows that it was intended to be a clandestine deal from the beginning, hidden from the American people. Former Iranian President Ahmadinejad Tours Nuclear Processing Facility \\nWas Obama hoping to emerge as a hero after successfully negotiating a deal with Iran? If so, that effort fell flat. Recent investigations have revealed that he attempted another scheme in 2016 which involved making a cash down payment to Iran of more than a billion dollars, in order to secure the release of American hostages and to advance nuclear talks. \\nWhen it comes to an issue as important as nuclear proliferation in radical Islamist nations, we need a president who will engage the issue with transparency, and in the interest of the American people and world community. President Trump will likely succeed where Obama has failed. '],\n",
       " ['DOJ Wants To Overturn Microsoft V. United States - That Would Be A Disaster For Privacy Rights',\n",
       "  'Getty - Michael Bocchieri IJR Opinion is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \\nIn July, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned a ruling in Microsoft v. United States that forced Microsoft to hand over private email correspondence and other data to US law enforcement from servers based in Dublin, Ireland. It was a victory for privacy because the Department of Justice (DOJ) was unable to force compliance of the Stored Communications Act . \\nBut last week, the DOJ expressed interest in re-hearing Microsoft v. United States , once again jeopardizing domestic and international privacy rights. If the decision is overturned, not only will Microsoft’s security be threatened, but so too will all foreign nations that house data owned by any US-based company. \\nIf the July ruling is indeed overturned, the Fourth Amendment will be seriously weakened and taxpayers will have no assurance that continued overreach by the DOJ will be stopped. Not only will future domestic investigations not need a warrant, but neither will those of an international scope. The utter lack of safeguards in place would point to a foreseeable overreach by U.S. investigators and the destruction of the nation’s diplomatic efforts. \\nThe U.S. government would assuredly be mad if a foreign country took private data and intelligence from our soil without a warrant. After all, the U.S. has started wars over more trivial matters. So why would any reasonable court believe that the U.S. has a special “hall-pass” to do whatever it pleases with other nations’ data? \\nThe root of the problem is the Stored Communications Act, which is part of the outdated Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). Under ECPA, any data held by U.S. companies fewer than 180 days old can be “legally” confiscated by the government. \\nOf course, the problem with this antiquated policy becomes quite apparent when applied to a modern world - a world where data is consumed at ridiculous rates. ECPA was signed into legislation before personal computers were around and when a gigabyte of storage cost more than $200,000 . Nowadays, practically everybody uses a computer and a gigabyte of storage costs just 4 cents. \\nIf the Microsoft case is re-opened, the DOJ would have the ability to use ECPA’s outdated loopholes to circumvent the Fourth Amendment and force data-based companies to comply, regardless of whether or not they have a warrant. \\nThankfully, Senators Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) have already introduced a bipartisan bill that will rectify the problem. Their bill, the International Consumers Protection Act (ICPA), will repeal and replace the antiquated wording of ECPA. The legislation will distinguish between search warrants that seek data held abroad for U.S. persons as opposed to foreign citizens, with the objective of upholding the Fourth Amendment to preserve the privacy rights of Americans. \\nIn a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the ICPA co-sponsors explained that, “when technology companies receive demands from U.S. law enforcement to turn over data on behalf of foreign customers, they are forced to make a difficult decision: either comply with the demand and satisfy U.S. law and risk violating the privacy laws of the host country, or challenge U.S. law enforcement’s request in order to comply with the laws of the host jurisdiction.” No legislation should force companies to be placed in such a difficult position, especially given the fact that the legislation threatens the very rights that provided the foundation for the success of firms like Microsoft. \\nICPA has the potential to quell the DOJ’s temper tantrum while paving the way for future policy that will protect our data from the “oversight” of policy makers. This will foster the preservation and growth of law enforcement and consumer privacy while respecting the Bill of Rights. \\nCongress can and will fix the problems with current law. Officials in the DOJ don’t need to mess it up any further by re-opening Microsoft v. United States . Instead, they should open their pocket Constitutions and take another look at the Fourth Amendment. '],\n",
       " ['FBI Found \"Tens Of Thousands Of Emails\" Belonging To Huma Abedin On Weiner\\'s Laptop | RedFlag News',\n",
       "  '\\nZERO HEDGE \\nWith furious Democrats - and the Clinton Campaign - now openly blasting the FBI\\'s reopened investigation (as Republicans take delight for once in having a government agency reinforce their side of events), the question turns to just what emails were found on Weiner\\'s laptop, and how damaging their contents are for the FBI to take the unprecedented step of \"intervening\" in a major political event just days before the national election. \\nWe first laid what was the most likely explanation yesterday , when we showed several examples of Huma Abedin emails being sent from her work email account to her personal account at , courtesy of a Judicial Watch FOIA release. Of the more than 160 emails in the latest Judicial Watch release, some 110 emails – two-thirds of the total – were forwarded by Abedin to two personal addresses she controlled. The Washington Times reported in August 2015 that the State Department had admitted to a federal judge that Abedin and Mills used personal email accounts to conduct government business in addition to Clinton’s private clintonemail.com to transact State Department business. \\nOne email from May 15, 2009, was sent by Abedin from her State Department email to her personal email. Abedin was archiving in her personal email account an email Hillary Clinton sent her from Clinton’s private email server at . Abedin was asked to print out attachments to an email Mills sent via a private address the previous day to Clinton involving “timetables and deliverables” for her review via Alec Ross, a technology policy expert who then held the title of senior adviser for innovation to Secretary Clinton. \\nHowever, while forwarding Hillary\\'s emails to her personal email server for \"convenience\" is one thing, what is more troubling is the amount of redaction involved in these emails which migrated to the open email account, which as we now know ended up in Anthony Weiner\\'s computer: in the above example, the two pages of timetables and deliverables attached to the email were 100 percent redacted, with “PAGE DENIED” stamped across the first redacted page. \\nAn argument can be made that the extensive redaction confirms confidential material was part of the transmission. \\nThis is a nuanced point being pushed by Hillary Clinton supporters such as Newsweek\\'s Kurt Eichenwald, who in an article yesterday tried to make a case citing \"sources\" (even though the FBI said that nobody has seen the content of the Weiner/Abedin emails), that \" no emails being examined by FBI were to or from Clinton .\" No emails being examined by FBI were to or from Clinton. All of this has to do with procedures followed by an aide. https://t.co/mcsBi7j7XU — Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 \\nIt remains to be seen just what is in the emails, although whether Hillary sent emails with confidential content herself, or directed, or simply allowed her closest aide, Huma Abedin to forward such emails to her outside unsecured email address (where they subsequently ended up on Anthony Weiner\\'s notebook), is what this latest case will be all about and how it will be defended and prosecuted in the media, by the water coolers and perhaps, in court. \\nHowever, we do know one thing: according to the NYT , the number of Huma emails that made their way to Weiner\\'s PC was staggering: \\nThe F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousand \\nWhich brings up two more critical questions: i) when she was questioned by the FBI over the summer, did Huma reveal and admit the existence of these \"thousands\" of emails located on a personal, home computer, and ii) will the FBI be able to comb through everything in the next 10 days ahead of the election? If the answer to the second question is no, will the US presidential election really take place with one candidate currently under FBI investigation, one which could potentially lead to impeachment proceedings within weeks or days of her being elected president? \\nStill, the biggest irony in this latest debacle is that it was largely predicted by Donald Trump himself back in August of 2015. It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails. Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. '],\n",

       "  ' Trump and the Power of Money\\nBy Peter Koenig\\n \" PIPR \" - Imagine, Donald Trump would accede to the US Presidency, an unlikely event with the presstitute media relentlessly slamming, slashing and demonizing him, not unlike they do with President Putin \\x96 while cheering no-end for the warmonger Killary, no matter what atrocities she has on her hands and body, no matter that blood is dripping out of her mouth every time she opens it \\x96 like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan, Sudan \\x96 and more, much more. They, the elite, the military-security complex, the financial mafia, want more blood, more than is already covering the entire current Obama Administration\\x92s structure of psychopaths. Blood is weapons, blood is money, blood is more profit, blood is good for business \\x96 so said the Washington Post, just slightly translated from \\x91war is good for business\\x92. The warmongering MSM (mainstream media) also propagate for more weapons to enrich the military-security complex that pays them. But just for a moment, let\\x92s assume, Trump would get elected with such a large margin that voter fraud would be difficult to manage.\\nTrump is sending a different narrative from that of eternal war. Trump seems to be looking into a different direction. He essentially says \\x96 stop the conflict with Russia, make Russia a partner, stop outsourcing jobs, bring them back, give labor back to Americans, slash the unemployment rate \\x96 which is, of course, everybody knows, way above the silly fabricated 5%. The reality is that unreported but real unemployment in the US is hovering between 22% and 25%, a real hammer for the economy, increasing anger and unhappiness and crime. Trump also says in the same vein as bringing back jobs \\x96 STOP globalization, restrain NATO, rein in the banks \\x96 yes, Wall Street, the Goldman Sachs-es and Co. of this world of fake pyramid money, dominated by the Rothschild-Rockefeller-Morgan clan. Trump says, let\\x92s have a financial system that works for the people.\\nDoes he mean it? \\x96 I don\\x92t know. Could be true. Most of what he says makes sense for America, for Americans \\x96 and by extension for much of the rest of the world, especially Europe, the genuine Europe, not the puppet-commandeered Europe. He also says a lot of outright discriminatory and xenophobic rubbish \\x96 like building a wall separating Mexico from the US of A, emulating Israel; and propagates a crackdown on Moslems. Does he mean it? Or does he want to please potential voters? \\x96 Such statements are indeed dangerous rubbish, but they are secondary to all the other things that are PRIORITARY, as they would help restore American society, workforce, dignity \\x96 most important: DIGNITY. Dignity is important for Americans to wake up to realize that they are living in a country that wastes their money, the peoples\\x92 resources \\x96 on countless criminal wars around the world, feverishly racing towards Full Spectrum Dominance to benefit a few. The secondary stuff is important too, but can be dealt with in parallel by Americans that have come to senses.\\nTrump is in many ways like France\\x92s Marine LePen, representing the extreme right, and therefore, no matter what sensible things she says and has on her agenda to do \\x96 and I don\\x92t doubt one minute that she means what she says \\x96 like EUREXIT and send NATO to hell \\x96 she is still framed by the \\x91left intellectuals\\x92 \\x96 if such a thing still exists in our neoliberal universe \\x96 as a discriminatory xenophobe who would expel all \\x91colored\\x92 and \\x91veiled\\x92 foreigners. Of course, that\\x92s bad. But let her first initiating France exiting from the EU, the Euro and NATO \\x96 the likely salvation of Europe, then tackle the other issues. First comes first. A true intellectual left would have to understand that \\x96 and not bend to the presstitute promoted clichés.\\nTrump has enough money power. He doesn\\x92t have to bend to the military security complex, to the banks, to the Obamacare pharma-fiefdom. He doesn\\x92t really have to bend to anybody. That worries the elite. He is independent. Let\\x92s give him the benefit of the doubt. In no case could he be worse than Hillary \\x96 the killer \\x96 so much can be read from every word she says. Her pattern of pathology \\x96 \\x93We came, we saw, we won\\x94 , when she saw the bloodstained image of the NATO-slaughtered Ghaddafi \\x96 indicates that she would not stop from pressing this infamous Red Button of Death and total world annihilation \\x96 perhaps even repeating that same smirk, , \\x93We came, we saw, we won\\x94 .\\nNow let\\x92s go to the next hypothesis, assuming Trump would be elected and \\x91they\\x92 \\x96 the elusive high-powered small elite that pulls the strings on Washington and the White House\\x92s overseas puppets, and let\\x92s assume \\x91they\\x92 would let him live, at least for a while, Trump might be doing \\x91irrational\\x92 things in the eye of the Beltway slaves. Recognizing the perils for his own country and those for his neighbor, Canada, Mr. Trump might call on the western stooges, in Europe particularly, who for the sake of brown-nosing the naked king in Washington, are prepared to sell-out 500-plus million European and their future generations to the most nefarious trade deals the world has ever known \\x96 CETA, TTIP and TiSA (let alone the TPP, where 12 Pacific countries are about to kiss ass in Washington) \\x96 telling them to come to senses, think democracy and stop the deals that 80% or more of Europeans despise and reject.\\nAs a parenthesis and philosophically speaking, one could say that given the hundreds of years of colonization around the globe, of shameless exploitation, of raping and killing millions of people throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, that these trade \\x91deals\\x92 are Europe\\x92s historically deserved heritage.\\n\\x97\\x96\\nThe Saker wrote a great essay on the aberration of this upcoming election and what might follow after the election, \\x93The US Is About To Face The Worst Crisis in Their History\\x94 \\x96 http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article45729.htm . One of the article\\x92s commenters pinned it down to the point: \\x93 If Trump does become Commander in Chief, his first job will be securing his life. Those who really run the show in the US will stop at nothing to safeguard their empire. Truly the US is at a cross roads and by extension the world. Times are really scary .\\x94\\nWhat Trump says he would do during his first 100 days in office, he presented in a groundbreaking speech at Gettysburg, Pa. this past weekend, is for the most part truly astounding http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/24/donald-trump-delivers-a-powerful-policy-speech-on-his-first-100-days-in-office/ . It is not less than revolutionary, because no US politician, let alone a Presidential candidate or President has said something for the most part so sensible as did Presidential candidate Trump. Summarizing, he promises bringing back overseas jobs, would prevent the continued outsourcing of the American production processes, bring order to the crime-ridden communities, he would seek friendly partnership with Russia, defusing the WWIII threat \\x96 and he would tackle, restrain and control the corrupt banking system, including the endless money-making machine, the privately owned, Rothschild dominated FED. \\x96 That is a challenge other Presidents have failed to master, including Lincoln and JFK. We know how they ended.\\nTrump has already hinted that to revive the American economy the zero-interest policy may have to be changed, so that banks become more responsible. The owners off the system would hardly allow Trump\\x92s interference in their obscene profit-making scheme. They\\x92d rather at their calling let the bomb loose. A sudden change of this policy would hit many over-stretched banks like a bombshell \\x96 reminiscent of 2008 Lehman Brothers, just magnified by a factor of 10. There are currently at least three, possibly five Wall Street giants that are on the edge. They get by, because of the FED\\x92s zero interest policy- and they make sure that this doesn\\x92t change, as several if not all of them are part of the private FED system. Would Trump dare touching this system? \\x96 It\\x92s a deadly challenge. He knows it.\\nThis time there may be more at stake then just another banking collapse, a planned emulation of the 2007 / 2008 crisis, where Wall Street was copiously rewarded for its excesses by tax-money bail-outs. Be aware, this time it would not be tax-payer\\x92s money that would rescue the Too-Big-To Fail (TBTF) banks, but it would be YOUR money, your deposits, your savings, your pension funds, possibly even your shares if you have any in the bank being \\x91collapsed\\x92 \\x96 and the process would be called \\x91bail-ins\\x92.\\nThe (western) world is under the hegemon of a privately-owned money system, the US-dollar \\x96 and most people don\\x92t even know it. The accent is on the western world , because the east, comprising Russia, China, the SCO countries (Shanghai Cooperation Organization \\x96 comprising China and Russia and most of the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, plus Iran and Pakistan \\x96 and others are waiting in the wings), the EEU (Eurasian Economic Union), as well as most of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), are forming their own eastern economic and monetary block. \\x96 I have said this before, but will repeat it for readers to realize \\x96 this \\x91economic block\\x92 \\x96 is largely, if not entirely, delinked from the dollar scheme. It consists of about half the world\\x92s population and one third of the world\\x92s GDP, a solid GDP that is. In contrast to the western, especially the US GDP; in the eastern block much of the GDP is based on real labor output and manufacturing.\\nIn reality, this eastern economic power block which is also displaying the world\\x92s largest economic development potential, since history remembers, the New Silk Road \\x96 or the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) economic development scheme, stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon (if Europe chooses to participate), does not need the west anymore. The OBOR project has already begun. It represents a view into the future, with job opportunities and the outlook for a truly better life for hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people during coming generations \\x96 a dynamic vision for the future. The east is where the future lays.\\n\\x97\\x97-\\nDonald Trump as President notwithstanding, a new western well-planned banking collapse may start in the US, the ramifications and impact would be felt around the globe \\x96 sinking millions, hundreds of millions of people into poverty, misery, the like we haven\\x92t seen in recent history. The banks \\x91depositors\\x92 money might not be enough. The reptiles are hungry. They might privatize public properties, infrastructures, roads, ports railways, health care, education, pensions, natural resources \\x96 anything that is still in the hands of the people. If Greece is a reminder, then think of Greece blown up by a factor of 1000 \\x96 all around the globe, touching in extremis the vulnerable people of the vulnerable countries \\x96 billions of people. While the money flows again from the poor to the rich, to an ever-shrinking pool of super-rich; widening the rich-poor gap to a disgusting yawn. Leaving the 99.99 % \\x96 by now the 99. % ever more powerless, having to fend for sheer survival \\x96 seeking refuge in \\x91better lands\\x92 \\x96 It\\x92s a war by money. Canons, bombs and guns could rest \\x96 for a while.\\nFor years, I have felt the Empire will have to be brought down from inside \\x96 from the people who can\\x92t take it anymore, from an internal revolt that eventually would break the worldwide extended monster\\x92s back. Rome and most subsequent empires have fallen this way. It may still happen. But now I side more with The Saker\\x92s theory, namely that the defeat may come from a combination of inside revolt and outside forces, not so much military forces, but economic forces. In theory, it could happen tomorrow. Just imagine, the one third of world-GDP-countries would drop all their dollar reserves, all the dollar denominated international contracts, all dollar issued trade agreements \\x96 and in particular, abandon at once the unwritten rule of hydrocarbons to be traded only in US-dollars. It would most likely wipe out the western economy.\\nThis will not happen, of course. Simply, because the One Third GDP holders do not want to destroy the economy of the rest of the world, especially the so-called developing and emerging countries, many \\x96 or most of them \\x96 eventually to become allies of this eastern block that promises peaceful co-existence rather than the current western pattern of ever multiplying wars and conflicts \\x96 a sheer dollar-fed killing spree, with destruction and weapons manufacturing no end.\\nThe Power of Money. Would Donald Trump, as President, himself a moneyed powerhouse, survive such a calamity? In fact, would he be able and strong enough to veer the ship around, guiding the world away from such destructive scenarios and towards peace and cooperation between East and West? \\x96 Or is the train already too far out of the station? \\x96 No telling at this time. The signals are certainly not good. But, let\\x92s put in a grain of optimism and \\x91bank\\x92 on a positive strand of dynamics fueled by an increasing human consciousness \\x96 one that would not allow Hillary to push the Death Button.\\nPeter Koenig is an economist and geopolitical analyst.

Zeder, a senior research scientist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. \\nBut in recent years, Dr. Zeder and other archaeologists have overturned that consensus. Their research suggests that people were inventing farming at several sites in the Fertile Crescent at roughly the same time. In the Zagros Mountains of Iran, for example, Dr. Zeder and her colleagues have found evidence of the gradual domestication of wild goats over many centuries around 10,000 years ago. \\nPeople may have been cultivating plants earlier than believed, too. \\nIn the 1980s, Dani Nadel, then at Hebrew University, and his colleagues excavated a 23,000-year-old site on the shores of the Sea of Galilee known as Ohalo II. It consisted of half a dozen brush huts. Last year, Dr. Nadel co-authored a study showing that one of the huts contained 150,000 charred seeds and fruits, including many types, such as almonds, grapes and olives, that would later become crops. . A stone blade found at Ohalo II seemed to have been used as a sickle to harvest cereals. A stone slab was used to grind the seeds. It seems clear the inhabitants were cultivating wild plants long before farming was thought to have begun. \\n“We got fixated on the very few things we just happened to see preserved in the archaeological record, and we got this false impression that this was an abrupt change,” Dr. Zeder said. “Now we really understand there was this long period where they’re playing around with resources.” \\nre '],\n",

       " ['Libya is a Complete Western Disaster, Finds a British Parliamentary Report | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Libya Three years ago, NATO declared that the mission in Libya had been “one of the most successful in NATO history.” Today, this statement is a proven lie that was fed to the public at large in the West. A recently published report of British parliament’s foreign affairs committee has categorically acknowledged that the Western intervention in Libya in 2011 was not only based upon flawed intelligence but also directly paved the way for the resurgence of Islamist terror groups in the country. What had initially been propagated as a sort of “humanitarian intervention” to “protect” civilians from the “tyranny of Gaddafi” soon exacerbated into the notorious game of regime change and led to the subsequent disaster, proliferation of Islamist groups and Libya’s downfall from a reasonably stable state to a fragmented one. The report’s findings are, as such, highly critical in terms of the way the West, particularly the US, has been projecting the utmost necessity of NATO’s intervention. Even if we were to agree to the Western proposition that Gaddafi regime was inflicting atrocities on its people and that the real goal, as a recent article published by the corporate-funded Brookings Institute argues, was to protect people, the report finds it to be wrong. It unambiguously states: “Many Western policymakers genuinely believed that Muammar Gaddafi would have ordered his troops to massacre civilians in Benghazi, if those forces had been able to enter the city. However, while Muammar Gaddafi certainly threatened violence against those who took up arms against his rule, this did not necessarily translate into a threat to everyone in Benghazi. In short, the scale of the threat to civilians was presented with unjustified certainty. US intelligence officials reportedly described the intervention as “an intelligence-light decision.” Exposing the hollowness of the propagated “truths” that Gaddafi regime was indiscriminately killing his countrymen and that he would have continued to do so “ in large numbers if that’s what his survival required ”, the report states that nothing of this sort was happening at the time of intervention or was likely to follow. Intervention happened not because Gaddafi was inflicting atrocities but because he was winning the fight against Western and Arab funded militias: “Despite his rhetoric, the proposition that Muammar Gaddafi would have ordered the massacre of civilians in Benghazi was not supported by the available evidence. The Gaddafi regime had retaken towns from the rebels without attacking civilians in early February 2011.” The report goes on to state that: “On 17 March 2011, Muammar Gaddafi announced to the rebels in Benghazi, “Throw away your weapons, exactly like your brothers in Ajdabiya and other places did. They laid down their arms and they are safe. We never pursued them at all.” Subsequent investigation revealed that when Gaddafi regime forces retook Ajdabiya in February 2011, they did not attack civilians.” Contrary to this situation was the mantra of “protecting” people that was officially projected for public consumption, while the real goal was to send Gaddafi home and to re-design Libya’s future in which Gaddafi or his affiliates would have no role to play. The report states: “When the then Prime Minister David Cameron sought and received parliamentary approval for military intervention in Libya on 21 March 2011, he assured the House of Commons that the object of the intervention was not regime change. In April 2011, however, he signed a joint letter with United States President Barack Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy setting out their collective pursuit of “a future without Gaddafi”. That the goal was always to impose a new regime on the people of Libya is evident from another finding that no option other than that of military intervention was explored and considered: “The Government rapidly developed a new policy of intervention to protect civilians as Muammar Gaddafi’s forces approached Benghazi in mid-February 2011. It did not explore alternatives to military intervention such as sanctions, negotiations or the application of diplomatic pressure. In pursuing regime change, it abandoned a decade of foreign policy engagement…” What the West wanted to achieve by regime-change? As could be expected of the West, the real goal was to extend Western influence in the African continent. Libya was to be the gateway for that. However, as long as Gaddafi was there, this objective could never be realized. Hence, the anti-Gaddafi propaganda and the development of “pro-democracy” discourse in the West that paved the way for NATO-led intervention. The report enlists following critical objectives, which were of crucial importance for France’s Sarkozy, behind the military intervention and change of regime in Libya: 1. A desire to gain a greater share of Libya oil production. 2. Increase French influence in North Africa, 3. Improve his internal political situation in France, 4. Provide the French military with an opportunity to reassert its position in the world. 5. Address the concern of his advisors over Qaddafi’s long term plans to supplant France as the dominant power in Francophone Africa. Therefore to achieve these objectives, a dual strategy was implemented. On the one hand, NATO intervened and on the other hand weapons were allowed to be distributed to the Islamist militias. The report categorically states: “….the international community turned a blind eye to the supply of weapons to the rebels. Lord Richards highlighted “the degree to which the Emiratis and the Qataris…played a major role in the success of the ground operation.” For example, Qatar supplied French Milan antitank missiles to certain rebel groups. We were told that Qatar channelled its weapons to favoured militias rather than to the rebels as a whole.” Who were the “rebels”? While it is largely believed that that crisis in Libya were linked to a general uprising linked with the so-called “Arab Spring”, this is far from the truth. For one thing, a general popular uprising against an autocrat regime could not possibly have descended into a pure chaos but for the involvement of foreign funded extremist groups. This is precisely what happened in Libya. The critical question, therefore, is: were the Libyan rebels really “rebels”? The report disputes the Western official narrative that it was a general uprising and that extremists got involved at some alter stage . Contrary to the official narrative, the report concludes: “It is now clear that militant Islamist militias played a critical role in the rebellion from February 2011 onwards. They separated themselves from the rebel army, refused to take orders from non-Islamist commanders and assassinated the then leader of the rebel army, Abdel Fattah Younes.” That the West had “turned a blind eye” to the support certain militias were receiving from Arab countries is, in fact, an indication of the Western complicity in facilitating the rise of Islamist groups in Libya. And as the report states yet again: “We asked Lord Richards whether he knew that Abdelhakim Belhadj and other members of the al-Qaeda affiliated Libyan Islamic Fighting Group were participating in the rebellion in March 2011. He replied that that “was a grey area”. He added that “a quorum of respectable Libyans were assuring the Foreign Office” that militant Islamist militias would not benefit from the rebellion. He acknowledged that “with the benefit of hindsight, that was wishful thinking at best.” What is Libya today? A disastrous mess It is a mess, a victim of Western conspiracy and its notorious cold-war era policy of imposing regime change in countries that refuse to abide by their rules of global politics. Libya, today, is a disaster. Facts speak for themselves: In 2010, Libyan economy was generating US$75 billion in GDP, with an average per capita income of US$12,250, roughly equal to an average income in some European countries. As of 2016, however, Libya is likely to experience a budget deficit of some 60% of GDP. The United Nations ranked Libya as the world’s 94th most advanced country in its 2015 index of human development, a decline from 53rd place in 2010. Thanks to the Western intervention which was, to say the least, not only ill-informed and a result of propaganda against Gaddafi but also motivated by purely geo-political considerations. Thanks to the Western intervention that has ‘successfully’ transformed Libya from the richest African state under Gaddafi to a failed state under Western supervision. Its various experiments in Libya have failed to transform it into a pure Western vessel. And as the reports indicate, the US in now trying to install one of its long term assets, General Khalifa Hifter, who aims to set himself up as Libya’s new dictator and then help the West in transforming Africa’s political economy into a disastrous the kind of which Libya, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan today are. \\nSalman Rafi Sheikh, research-analyst of International Relations and Pakistan’s foreign and domestic affairs, exclusively for the online magazine “ New Eastern Outlook ”.

       " ['BREAKING – Ohio DNC Office Just Got A Very ‘Special’ Delivery – It’s EPIC | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'Email Print It would appear as though conservatives have had enough of the liberals dumping on our HQ’s around the country, so they decided to dump a little something on one of theirs! USA Today reports that in the early morning hours of Saturday, the Warren County, Ohio, Democrat Headquarters received a “gift” from an anonymous donor. Of course, the idea of a “gift” is always in the eyes of the receiver. Where a farmer would have been grateful for the donation, Democrat leadership was less than thrilled with it. The gift in question: a truckload of manure. Some would view this delivery as a “redistribution of wealth” – a truckload of manure isn’t necessarily cheap. Others may see it as the public giving back what Democrats have been shoveling out for the last eight years. While this “donation” is being categorized as an act of vandalism, you can’t help but believe that the police officers who took the call on this “contribution” had a stifled chuckle about it. There is a humorous aspect to this social commentary. “What reasonable person thinks this is OK?” Democrat Party Chair Bethe Goldenfield said in a post on social media. “I won’t be responding to anyone who thinks this is acceptable behavior. It is illegal !” The same thing happened in 2012, Goldenfield noted. Evidently, Ms. Goldenfield doesn’t appreciate the subtlety of the humor and/or the karma involved. One could argue that “what goes around comes around.” Warren County is a suburban Cincinnati county that overwhelmingly votes Republican. Mitt Romney garnered 69 percent of the vote in 2012. In fact, it’s been close to 40 years since a Democrat was elected to even a countywide office. In response to the news, the chairman of the Warren County Republican Party said the GOP had nothing to do with the manure. In an act of good faith, he extended access to organization volunteers “to help clean things up.” That is a far cry from anything Democrats have offered in the aftermath of much more serious incidents at Republican headquarters in North Carolina and Indiana. In North Carolina, someone firebombed the Orange County GOP headquarters. In that incident, graffiti was scrawled on the side of the building warning the Republican “Nazis” to leave the county or else. In Indiana, someone tossed a brick through the window of one local Republican headquarters. Both of these incidents – presumably executed by pro-Clinton operatives – caused extensive monetary damage. The “donation in Warren County, Ohio, caused no damage and, if Ms. Goldenfield was resourceful, she could have made a profit for the organization in selling the manure to a farmer or a garden center. These examples illustrate the fundamental differences between the Left and Right side of the aisle. Where the Right makes symbolic gestures that literally hurt no one and harm nothing, the Left firebombs and destroys property. Please tell me which party is the more civilized and intellectual party? All that Progressive enlightenment hasn’t amounted to much. What do you think about campaign “contribution” that was made to the Democrat Party in Ohio?

       " ['California Secessionists to Meet at Capitol Day After Presidential Election',\n",
       "  '\\nBy Joseph Jankowski \\nAn organization which has the aim to separate the state of California from the Union of the United States is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, November 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election. \\nThe Yes California Independence Campaign , which is based in San Diego, describes itself as a “nonviolent campaign to establish the country of California using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so.” \\nThe group is currently trying to qualify a citizen’s initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019, reports SF Gate . They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the state’s exit, or the “Calexit,” as they call it. \\n“In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children,” reads Yes California ’s official website. \\nThe group’s page reads on: \\nAlthough charity is part of our culture, when you consider that California’s infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.\\nIt is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths: (1) California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and (2) California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. \\nYes California ’s website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. \\nOne blog post on their page draws parallels with a “Calexit” and the recent referendum known as “Brexit” that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. \\nThe push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. \\nModoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . \\nIn 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson. \\nJoseph Jankowski is a contributor for Planet Free Will.com .

       " ['George Soros Seems to be “a Bit Jealous” These Days | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World George Soros’ direct involvement in spreading the unrest in the United States that was triggered by the recent Donald Trump’s victory at the presidential election is hardly a secret to anyone now. George Soros and other wealthy liberals who have spent tens of millions of dollars on Hillary Clinton’s campaign are gathering in Washington on Sunday evening on a three-day closed conference to close their ranks in the fight against Donald Trump, the POLITICO notes . It’s reported that the conference, which kicked off Sunday night at Washington’s pricey Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club, and will include appearances by leaders of most leading unions and liberal groups. It’s safe to assume that liberals plan full-on trench warfare against Trump from day one. Soros’ business practises have been heavily criticized by various analysts over the years, since this billionaire is often referred to as a speculator. The Quantum company that Soros heads over the last forty years has produced a fortune that remains unseen in the world of hedge funds – 35 billion dollars. The US mortgage crisis alone allowed Soros to raise over a billion dollars in just two years. However, it’s clear that Soros is not contended with the amount of money he has, since he’s been displaying a paranoid desire to control the world, while investing his wealth into the so-called color revolutions that are aimed at toppling elected officials across the world. Due to a number of scandals when sensitive to Soros documents were uploaded on the Internet after being stolen by anonymous hackers, we now know that Soros’ Open Society has been trying to influence certain political developments in a number of European countries. The billionaire has been repeatedly accused of staging color revolutions in a number of Eastern European countries, including Georgia. In 2015 a coup d’etat in Ukraine resulted in Petro Poroshenko taking the power in the country. Now he has awarded Soros with the Order of Freedom to honor his “comitment to the democratic changes that are taking place in Ukraine.” Moreover, last April WikiLeaks released documents that would show that the scandal that broke out around the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that is known to the world as the Panama Papers scandal was directly sponsored by the Soros Foundation. Last August, as it’s been reported by various media sources, spent a total of 33 million dollars to fuel unrest in Ferguson. Up to 79% of the arrested individuals during the riots were not locals, those radicals have been brought to this town from all over the US to provoke clashes with local police units. The ongoing investigation has little doubt that Freguson riots were not spontaneous, they were cleverly staged and directed from a single center. One can easily find George Soros among the top donors of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, spending a total of 9 million dollars officially on supporting the Democratic candidate. However, Soros couldn’t care less about “democracy,” as profits is all that he cares for in this life. That is why Soros has unleashed a veritable war against Trump, forming groups of so-called activists that are using the hashtag #NotMyPresiden, along with the MoveOn.org movement that billed over 200 “United Against Hate” actions as “peaceful,” and while most of the protest activity has remained so, some rallies been marred by vandalism and violence.). The Washington Times would note : After five days of anti-Trump protests and mayhem led by left-wing groups, including one linked to top Clinton donor George Soros, Republicans said Sunday that it’s time for Democrats to call off the dogs . A notorious financial analyst of Live Trading News Paul Ebeling is convinced that the Clintons, who both have received millions of dollars in campaign contributions and Clinton Foundation donations from George Soros, were, in fact, helping to launch Soros’s Purple Revolution in America. The Purple Revolution will resist all efforts by the Trump Administration to push back against the globalist policies of the Clintons and soon-to-be ex-President Barack Hussein Obama. However, Donald Trump is no newcomer to financial markets and dirty tricks that are used on those, and he’s been pretty clever throughout his election campaign. Therefore it’s unlikely that Soros will find any success in spreading unrest during the Trump era that is now dawning.

By: Amanda Prestigiacomo November 17, 2016 \\nAs a woman who rejects third-wave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis, I\\'ve had my fair share of feminists tell me that I only reject them and their ideas because I suffer from \"internalized misogyny,\" or, in other words, I\\'m a self-loathing sexist. \\nHere\\'s exactly how Everyday Feminism defines \"internalized misogyny,\" if you\\'re unfamiliar with bats*** crazy: \\nInternalized misogyny, by definition, is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women. \\nIt becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate, overtly and covertly, that women are less than men – less worthy, less strong, less dependable, less able, less of a leader, less logical – while also more than men: more emotional, more irrational, more complex, more to manage. \\nOf course, this is ridiculous, and I gave such an assertion about as much time as a I would a male feminist hitting on me: zero seconds. \\nBut on Wednesday, I learned that Team Hillary, the political left, likewise thought me a self-loathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for Queen Pantsuit because I couldn\\'t stomach the thought of a powerful woman, since I apparently believe women are lessers. In fact, I—a woman with a chronic case of \"internalized misogyny”—cost Hillary the election; not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity, nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag.

And no, I will not cater to your preferred pronouns, you entitled brat. (Pro-tip: Once the number of genders you\\'ve made-up passes the number of flavors at Baskin Robbins, it\\'s time to admit you have a problem.) \\n\"You\" are the social justice warriors who tell me I\\'m a hateful, selfish, capitalistic pig from your iPhone at your local safe space, equipped with coloring books, bubbles and puppies, across from the Starbucks you work weekends at. \\n\"You\" are the social justice warriors who viciously riot when you don\\'t get your way, meanwhile you\\'re not even registered to vote . \\n\"You\" are the social justice warriors shouting-down any free speech which doesn\\'t perfectly align with your ideology, ironically in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness. \\n\"You\" are the virtue-signaling celebrities who think I give a hoot about your political stance.

And, as far as global warming is concerned, which is a real problem about Trump, it’s also very much and demonstrably — not merely in words — a real problem about Hillary too (and one that back in July 2015 before the Party nominees had been chosen, even was courageously reported by some of HuffPo’s own reporters ), but HuffPo and other Democratic Party propagandists pretend there’s reason to believe that Trump’s actions would be even worse than hers have been, and HuffPo’s readers thus end up being little else than Democratic Party suckers who feel satisfied in their ‘news’ reading to soak up what is almost entirely Democratic Party propaganda, which means the propaganda emanating out of the White House whenever a Democrat resides there — sort of like a Democratic Party version of the Republican Party’s Fox ‘News’. \\nThe aristocracy (all of it, both its Republican and its Democratic Party branches) continue their campaign, and expect to crush their opposition — the public (of all parties).

His paternal roots are Arabic and he sees himself to be on the “left” side of politics, anti-Israel lobby, anti-Empire, but of late, him and I have not been able to see eye-to-eye on the Trump-Clinton race to the Whitehouse issue. \\nHe is with the view that Obama has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he could, and that he should not be blamed for his failure to “perform” as many did after his elaborate and successful “yes we can” slogan. He supported Obama-care and other domestic reform policies, and this is perhaps where Roger and I stop to agree and start to disagree. \\nMany, including Roger, look at the appalling record of the Republican American Party and try to paint a tainted image of it. The party that is affectionately called the Grand Old Party or the GOP by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide. The GOP has given birth to monsters; people like Nixon, the Bushes, and of course, who can forget Dr. Kissinger?

If tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis had to die for him to achieve his objective, he would not and did not blink. \\nThis is the party that condones and feeds Christian Zionists. It is the party that has huge control over the media. It is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise. \\nSadly, and whether the rest of the world likes it or not, until the current global status quo changes, no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the United States. Whilst elections in other countries are by-and-large domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country concerned, American elections have implications that are not only domestically bound, but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world. \\nAs a non-American, personally, I am much more concerned about the wider global implications of American politics than the domestic ones. This is not to say that I am indifferent about America and the American people. As a matter of fact, not only do I have close friends who live in America, but also close family members there, and I have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the globe, by my interest in American politics remains focused on foreign policy matters; and to this effect, I am only able to relate to the choice between the major two American parties from the perspective of their foreign policies. \\nAs America insists to be the world police and the unrivalled superpower, a stature many Americans are refusing to accept that they have already lost, it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the American people will choose the better candidate as the new president; or should I say the one who is less harmful to the world. \\nIn between Donald and Hillary, who fits the less-harmful bill? This is the question. \\nEnough has been recently said about Hillary’s health to write a horror novel. Her “mini-strokes” and “alleged” recent case of pneumonia have made headlines as big, if not bigger than her infamous hidden emails, allegations of involvement in the murder of an American Ambassador and even selling arms to ISIS. Very recently however, the issue of the emails is resurfacing again, and very late in the campaign, perhaps late enough to serve Hillary with a knock out. \\nHowever, her zeal to reach the Whitehouse seems to have been in her mind even before Bill’s (her husband) Monica scandal back in 1998. Hillary was prepared to publicly support Bill, appear to “forgive” him and move on, because she had a bigger fish to fry; the Whitehouse. She somehow managed to hush down all other sex offence allegations against Bill, all the while, and hypocritically, trying to score mileage from similar allegations against Trump. \\nHer unabated lust for power will not stop at anything for as long as she ends up at the helm, the first female American President, even if she has to be Commander In Chief from behind the control button of a wheelchair. \\nThere are even observations and allegations that many people who have campaigned against her have died under suspicious circumstances. Whether this mystery is going to be taken up by main stream media just on the eve of the elections to serve her with yet another under-the-belt knock out remains to be seen. \\nHer uncontrollable laughs and hysterical facial expressions leave many questions unanswered. \\nIn between the two front runners Donald and Hillary, it is hard to say that she presents herself as the sane and rational choice. \\nIs there a party-based distinction on foreign affairs matters? Perhaps now, but not historically. \\nFor some reason, the American Republican Party is seen as the party of the hawks and the Democrats are seen as the doves. But are they? \\nTo answer this question in an unbiased manner, we ought to look back at history. Notwithstanding the colourful history of the GOP, the Bushes; father and son, Cheney, the NeoCons and Co., what is really the history of the American Democratic Party? \\nA few landmark historical decisions make it very clear. So let us start with current events before we dwell into recent history that some might have chosen to forget. \\nThe “War On Syria” was the brainless child of the so-called “Arab Spring”, a spring that was heralded by the visit of an American President to Cairo and a speech he made to Sunni Muslim clergy at Al-Azhar University. The President’s name is Barak Obama, and he is a Democrat. Obama’s speech was a subtle endorsement for the Arab street, and to be specific to the Sunni Muslim Arab street to rise. \\nThe Maidan phenomenon and all the events that followed in Ukraine, the anti-Russian sanctions, escalations and intimidations and the creation of a very volatile situation in Europe; a situation that remains hot and of unpredictable consequences, have all been orchestrated by the same President; Obama….a Democrat. \\nLast but not least, the current tension in the South China Sea is also the outcome of the same President, the incumbent Democrat; Barak Obama. \\nNow, let us not forget that President Obama is a Nobel Prize laureate; ironically for peace. \\nThe American involvement in the Vietnam War started under the tenure of the sweetheart Hollywood-star like American President; JFK. It reached its climax during the LBJ administration. Both Kennedy and Johnson were Democrats. \\nBut all of the above monstrosity is dwarfed by dropping the A-Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many strategists have argued over the last seven decades as to whether or not President Truman had no other choice to end the war quickly, but those arguments do not change the fact that two; not one, atom bombs were dropped on cities. It is pertinent to note here that the Manhattan Project generated two types of bombs, “Little Boy” (used in Hiroshima) and “Fat Man” (used in Nagasaki). It doesn’t take a genius to at least suspect that the American administration wanted to test the two types and that therefore, in their eyes, destroying Hiroshima alone was not enough. \\nThat said, and even though no A-Bombs were dropped in Western Europe and specifically on Germany, the brutality that civilians in German towns and cities have suffered were simply acts of vengeance and many of them had no military gains to achieve. \\nHarry Truman was not a Republican. He was yet another Democrat. \\nBut haven’t we forgotten the other Democrat sweetheart of the Whitehouse? The almost saint-in-waiting? The smiling Colgate-ad President Jimmy Carter. \\nMany see that Carter had an impeccable record of being a humanitarian of the highest degree. As a matter of fact, credit must be given to him for his post-presidency peace campaigns, and specifically for standing up for the Palestinian people and for not being silenced by the Israel lobby. \\nHowever, in reality, it was during the Carter administration that Al-Qaeda was created under the blessing and auspices of the USA. It was a criminal with a twisted mind aka Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s National Security Advisor, who actually established the first Jihadist army. In his narrow-minded and short-sighted vision, he thought that the best way to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan was to support and train Islamist fighters to rise against the “infidel” Communists. And even though the plot eventually generated ISIS, a monster that turned not only against the hand the fed it but also against the whole world, to this date, Brzezinski maintains that he came up with a genius master plan. Once again, Carter and Brzezinski were both Democrats. \\nAnd now, it is Clinton who is beating up the drums of war against Russia and China. \\nAmericans may have their legitimate preferences that would make them go either for Trump or for Clinton. Supporters of each team can and do provide huge lists that make their candidate of choice the better one. Arguably, one of them could well be better for America; the truth is that as a citizen of the world, and as mentioned before, I am more interested in a President who is better for the rest of the world. \\nWhether Trump will trump up the military after an election win is anyone’s guess. But Clinton is beating the drums of war already. To this effect, and as we stand today, on the international arena, she is the hawk; not Trump. \\nAmericans who are disenchanted by wars must realize that this time around, the choice to vote Democrat is an endorsement of her war aspirations. \\nAmericans with two minds as to which way to go on the 8 th of this month ought to remember that whatever their personal, local and/or domestic issues are, the USA will not win a nuclear war against either Russia or China; let alone both combined. \\nThose swinging voters who easily vote for either major party depending on an array of factors, should hopefully discern that this time that a vote for Clinton is a vote for war. \\nIf some have never voted for the GOP in the past, and more so are physically unable to vote for Trump, and/or if others are disenchanted by both major parties or actually never voted before, and if they regard both candidates as equally farcical, one would wonder as to what are waiting for to vote outside the two major parties? What caliber of Democrat and Republican candidates are such reluctant American voters waiting for to vote for a third option? \\nSome argue that a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote because the Greens will never make it into the Whitehouse, at least not in the foreseeable future, but in reality, any vote that does not endorse Hillary Clinton is not a wasted vote.

       " ['The Trump Election: Life Have Mercy On Us | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World The world economies are in a crisis. They cannot provide for the needs and well being of the people, guarantee them peace, nor act in effective concert to stop and reverse the rapid global warming that these have economies created and which will utterly destroy civilisation in our lifetime. The crisis in capitalism has been evident for a century and resulted in two world wars and threatens a third. The remaining socialist countries that provide another model of economic development and another view of humanity cannot reach their potential as they are surrounded by an international system of capital that cannot tolerate any interference in its search for profit and aggressively undermines and attacks peoples who have chosen the socialist path. We have seen what the socialist republics in the USSR had to suffer when they succeeded. Only a return to a mixed economy, a revival of some state industries, and the defeat of the gangsters that first appeared as the representatives of capital have improved conditions for the people of those republics, in particular Russia. The new Russian state still holds onto some of the principles, the hopes for international law and sovereignty of nations and peoples, that were a defining characteristic of the Soviet Union. It still believes that the world’s peoples are all one and should live in cooperation with each other. The Communist Party and other left parties are still strong and have an influence among the people and the government. The lingering legacy of the socialist epoch has produced a leadership that seems, at least in comparison to those in other capitalist countries, rational and even, in some ways, enlightened. But still, Russia is also now part of the capitalist international and subject to its laws. So are the people of the United States and the other NATO countries. Those laws are cruel and criminal. They stipulate that to make more profit working people have to be paid less, for profit does not come out of thin air as western economists would have it; it comes from the value added to products by labour power that is forced from workers without compensation. In other words, the profit is ours but they take it. This fact dictates that the only way in which President-elect Trump can “bring back jobs to America” is to lower wages to the level that we now see in China, or worse Africa where workers are paid about a dollar a day. American companies moved their production out of the US and Canada with “free” trade to cheap labour markets to increase their profit. They are not going to return to the USA just because Donald Trump promised the people that they will. To return and pay higher wages, even those which are relatively low by the standards of the 50’s and 60’s, is to return and lose money. If Trump is serious about “creating jobs” then the only way he can succeed is to force the cost of labour down, that is reduce wages. We can expect more attacks on unions and union organising, a freeze or a lowering of the minimum wage, an influx of more cheap labour from Mexico and other countries. His promise to “build a wall” along the Mexican border is a lot of hot air, for to build it will raise the cost of business. Too many small industries and services in the US depend on this cheap labour and its presence depresses wages for the rest. We have seen this happen across the western world since the capitalists seized power in the USSR. As soon as that occurred every western country began the roll back of all the gains that working people had achieved after the Second World War. This roll-back, this rapid lowering of the standard of living of the mass of the people, in every country, followed by recessions, overproduction and more war as they fight for resources, using our money and bodies, is accelerating. The rise of the far right parties in Europe and the United States reflects this decline in the lives of the majority. Since the mass media has effectively convinced too many that the socialist path has failed, or as in the United States, cannot even be considered, people seek a remedy with the right-wing populist demagogues who promise them a chicken in every pot and peace in our time. We have seen where this leads; to nationalism and to war and these are always accompanied by xenophobia, racism, and other scapegoating techniques to divert attention from the root causes of the situation and create the atmosphere for war. Those who hope for better relations between Russia and the United States have the right to hope, but the international situation has not changed overnight. The United States still seeks to dominate the world, and Trump’s promise to “make America great again” in contrast to Clinton’s “America is great” bragging, reflects the struggle inside the United States between those who think it can still succeed in dominating the world with its current structure and resources and those who have decided that a transformation has to take place for the United States to stay top dog in the world. The internal struggle in the United States has been a bitter one and it still is not settled which faction of the ruling elite will assume the power needed to make such a transformation possible. But the only people to benefit from that struggle, a struggle in which the people are and will be used as pawns to support one faction or the other, will be the already powerful and the already wealthy. The mass of the people will be the playthings of people in dark shadows and will turn on each other before they expose those shadows to the light. The American election was not about left or right, for there is no effective, organised left in that country. There are only degrees of the right. It was not about making lives better for its people. A large section of the voting population did not vote for there was nothing for them to vote for. The remainder took part in the theatre, played their part, few understanding the role they played and are still playing. The world stands on edge, wondering if we have been saved from the corrupt, venal war-monger that is Clinton or shackled with another corrupt nationalist reactionary in Trump, who will send us all down the same violent path. But, of course, both are true. For the world crisis continues and can only continue when leaders use “terrorism” to play upon the peoples’ weaknesses and fears, when the peoples doubts are used against them, when a man like Trump wears a mask of peace for one sucker and then is just a businessman for another, a straight talker, misunderstood; who knows how to get to this man with his wallet, this woman with her hatred for her boss, this one through ignorance and that one through the bribe, while offering everything because the offering’s cheap, but who works for those satisfied with nothing less than making the world their personal domain. In reality the world stands on edge because the dominant ideology in the west offers no solutions to the crisis because it is itself the crisis. Capital cannot rule for the benefit of the people. It does not matter what brand of capitalism they are selling. It produces for profit not for need. The only way out of this crisis is for working people to start to once again sit down with each other and discuss what the cause of their problems is, and what needs to be done to change that. In Europe, and Latin America, Asia, and Africa, the left has a rich and proud history that most have not forgotten and so, perhaps, we can hope they will push back against the forces of the right that are being drawn out of the mud to fool and oppress the people. But in the United States where the left is weak and in disarray and the far right is rising without effective opposition, the situation is very bleak, for the American election did not resolve the crisis but only increased it; and in reaction I can only repeat what the great American poet, Stephen Vincent Benet, once wrote, “Life have mercy on us.” Christopher Black is an international criminal lawyer based in Toronto, he is a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada and he is known for a number of high-profile cases involving human rights and war crimes, especially for the online magazine “New Eastern Outlook.” Popular Articles '],\n",
       " ['PAY TO PLAY : Hillary’s Two Big Favors For Morocco Netted Her $28 Million – TruthFeed',\n",
       "  'PAY TO PLAY : Hillary’s Two Big Favors For Morocco Netted Her $28 Million PAY TO PLAY : Hillary’s Two Big Favors For Morocco Netted Her $28 Million Breaking News By TruthFeedNews October 31, 2016 \\nBy Richard Pollock – DailyCaller \\nHillary Clinton did two huge favors for Morocco during her tenure as secretary of state while the Clinton Foundation accepted up to $28 million in donations from the country’s ruler, King Mohammed VI, according to new information obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group. \\nClinton and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Lisa Jackson tried to shut down the Florida-based Mosaic Company in 2011, operator of America’s largest phosphate mining facility. \\nJackson’s close ties and loyalty to the Clintons were revealed when she joined the Clinton Foundation’s board of directors in 2013, just months after she left the EPA. Jackson is also close to John Podesta , Clinton’s national campaign chairman. \\nMorocco’s state-owned phosphate company, OCP, would ostensibly have benefited from Jackson’s move to shut down Mosaic. Mohammed donated up to $15 million to the Clinton Foundation through OCP. \\nClinton also relaxed U.S. foreign aid restrictions on Morocco, thus allowing U.S. funds to be used in the territory of Western Sahara where OCP operates phosphate mining operations. The aid restrictions stemmed from Morocco’s illegal occupation of the territory since 1974. \\nMorocco is repeatedly condemned for seizing the territory and for unilaterally extracting the country’s valuable minerals, impoverishing what’s left of the local Sahrawi Arabs. \\nNo nation recognizes Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara and the United Nation’s Security Council legal office and the International Court of Justice both demand that Muhammed withdraw his claim over the territory and end illegal extraction of minerals. \\nAn email WikiLeaks made public last week illustrated how Clinton, while acting as secretary of state, negotiated an additional $12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Muhammed in return for holding the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. Another $1 million payment came from OCP to cover the expenses of the CGI meeting. \\nThe regulatory assault against the U.S. phosphate industry began in earnest when Jackson launched a barrage of intimidating regulatory initiatives against Mosaic. Environmental concerns about phosphates date from 1979 but the EPA did little to address concerns related to phosphate mining until Jackson’s 2011 moves. \\nThe regulatory assault on the U.S. phosphate industry encompassed several agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS aircraft flew at low altitudes over Mosaic’s central Florida operations in search of environmental problems. The EPA also threatened large Superfund penalties, which could have bankrupted Mosaic. \\nPhosphates are essential ingredients in fertilizers used in American farming. Closing or reducing Mosaic’s output would have cost tens of thousands of American jobs and injured the country’s agricultural productivity. \\nIt also would leave the U.S. dependent upon foreign phosphate producers, but particularly Morocco’s OCP. The only other countries that mine phosphates are Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. \\nRep. Dennis Ross, a Republican congressman who represents the Florida district where Mosaic operates, told TheDCNF he now sees why the EPA went after Mosaic. \\n“The tactics makes perfect sense as to why the EPA, under Lisa Jackson’s tutelage, targeted Mosaic’s phosphate operations in my district. I was never given any answers when I questioned Lisa Jackson about the EPA’s deliberate actions against Mosaic,” Ross told TheDCNF. \\n“Now I know why. An environmental concern never existed. This targeting was all done as a payback to Morocco for donating millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation,” Ross said. \\nAn uproar from Florida regulators push-back from the state’s congressional delegation and the agency’s tenuous legal position all forced the EPA to end its threats against Mosaic. \\nRep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and a vocal critic of the Clinton Foundation, agreed with Ross, saying “these facts seem to reveal the possibility of more pay-to-play activities at the Clinton Foundation.” \\n“It would be especially troubling if the Clinton Foundation was working with the EPA to suppress the American phosphate industry in favor of Morocco. The EPA and Clinton Foundation should be forthcoming about their dealings with the Moroccan government and the American phosphate industry.” \\nClinton’s 2012 support of a rider on the U.S. foreign aid bill permitting foreign aid to be sent to the Western Sahara arguably legitimized Moroccan occupation of territory and depopulated the Sahrawi Arabs. Native Moroccans were sent into the country by the government to extract the minerals. \\nThe rider approved by Clinton said that U.S. foreign aid funds “may be used in regions and territories administered by Morocco,” meaning, the Western Sahara. The Western Sahara is classified a “Non-Self-Governing Territory” under international law. \\n“Previously, United States excluded Western Sahara from bilateral assistance to avoid seeming to endorse Moroccan control,” said Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Northwestern University School of Law, in a legal review of occupied territories around the world. \\nHans Corell, the U.N. Security Council’s Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, said in January 2002 that “if further exploration and exploitation activities were to proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara, they would be in violation of the international law principles applicable to mineral resource activities in Non-Self-Governing Territories.” \\nA Dec. 10, 2015 report by the International Court of Justice ruled that “the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over Western Sahara is not recognized by the European Union or its Member States, or more generally by the UN, and the absence of any international mandate capable of justifying Moroccan presence on that territory.” \\nBut none of that mattered to former President Bill Clinton, who said nothing about the world’s condemnation of Morocco’s exploitation of the area for its phosphate industry, while speaking at the Clinton Foundation’s 2015 Marrakech CGI conference. Instead, he praised it. \\n“The Moroccans who are here will tell you that in the last several years, they have become the Saudi Arabia of phosphates, and what they have done with it, to diversify their economy and to make it part of a comprehensive strategy instead of another example of resource curse, is very impressive indeed,” Clinton said. \\n“Hillary Clinton sold her soul when they accepted that money,” reported Politico the day after the Marrakech CGI conference. \\nH/T – DailyCaller \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.

       " ['Break Up the Democratic Party: It’s Time for the Clintons and Rubin to Go – and Soros too. - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nIn the week leading up to last Tuesday’s election the press was busy writing obituaries for the Republican Party. This continued even after Donald Trump’s “surprising” victory – which, like the 2008 bank-fraud crash, “nobody could have expected.” The pretense is that Trump saw what no other politician saw: that the economy has not recovered since 2008. \\nDemocrats still seem amazed that voters are more concerned about economic conditions and resentment against Wall Street (no bankers jailed, few junk mortgages written down). It is a sign of their wrong path that party strategists are holding onto the same identity politics they have used since the 1960s to divide Americans into hyphenated special-interest groups. \\nObviously, the bottom 95 Percent realize that their incomes and net worth have declined, not recovered. National Income and Federal Reserve statistics show that all growth has accrued to just 5 percent of the population. Hillary is said to have spent $1 billion on polling, TV advertising and high-salaried staff members, but managed not to foresee the political reaction to this polarization. She and her coterie ignored economic policy as soon as Bernie was shoved out of the way and his followers all but told to join a third party. Her campaign speech tried to convince voters that they were better off than they were eight years ago. They knew better! \\nSo the question now is whether Donald Trump will really a maverick and shake up the Republican Party. There seems to be a fight going on for Donald’s soul – or at least the personnel he appoints to his cabinet. Thursday and Friday saw corporate lobbyists in the Republican leadership love-bombing him like the Moonies or Hari Krishna cults welcoming a new potential recruit. Will he simply surrender now and pass on the real work of government to the Republican apparatchiks? \\nThe stock market thinks so! On Wednesday it soared almost by 300 points, and repeated this gain on Thursday, setting a DJIA record! Pharmaceuticals are way up, as higher drug prices loom for Medicaid and Medicare. Stocks of the pipelines and major environmental polluters are soaring, from oil and gas to coal, mining and forestry, expecting U.S. environmental leadership to be as dead under Trump as it was under Obama and his push for the TPP and TTIP (with its fines for any government daring to impose standards that cost these companies money). On the bright side, these “trade” agreements to enable corporations to block public laws protecting the environment, consumers and society at large are now presumably dead. \\nFor now, personalities are policy. A problem with this is that anyone who runs for president is in it partly for applause. That was Carter’s weak point, leading him to cave into Democratic apparatchiks in 1974. It looks like Trump may be a similar susceptibility. He wants to be loved, and the Republican lobbyists are offering plenty of applause if only he will turn to them and break his campaign promises in the way that Obama did in 2008. It would undo his hope to be a great president and champion of the working class that was his image leading up to November 8. \\nThe fight for the Democratic Party’s future (dare I say “soul”?) \\nIn her Wednesday morning post mortem speech, Hillary made a bizarre request for young people (especially young women) to become politically active as Democrats after her own model. What made this so strange is that the Democratic National Committee has done everything it can to discourage millennials from running. There are few young candidates – except for corporate and Wall Street Republicans running as Blue Dog Democrats. The left has not been welcome in the party for a decade – unless it confines itself only to rhetoric and demagogy, not actual content. For Hillary’s DNC coterie the problem with millennials is that they are not shills for Wall Street. The treatment of Bernie Sanders is exemplary. The DNC threw down the gauntlet. \\nInstead of a love fest within the Democratic Party’s ranks, the blame game is burning. The Democrats raised a reported $182 million dollars running up to the election. But when from Russ Feingold in Wisconsin and other candidates in Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania asked for help. Hillary monopolized it all for TV ads, leaving these candidates in the lurch. The election seemed to be all about her, about personality and identity politics, not about the economic issues paramount in most voters’ minds. \\nSix months ago the polls showed her $1 billion spent on data polling, TV ads and immense staff of sycophants to have been a vast exercise in GIGO. From May to June the Democratic National Committee (DNC) saw polls showing Bernie Sanders beating Trump, but Hillary losing. Did the Democratic leadership really prefer to lose with Hillary than win behind him and his social democratic reformers. \\nHillary doesn’t learn. Over the weekend she claimed that her analysis showed that FBI director Comey’s reports “rais[ing] doubts that were groundless, baseless,” stopped her momentum. This was on a par with the New York Times analysis that had showed her with an 84 percent probability of winning last Tuesday. She still hasn’t admitted that here analysis was inaccurate. \\nWhat is the Democratic Party’s former constituency of labor and progressive reformers to do? Are they to stand by and let the party be captured in Hillary’s wake by Robert Rubin’s Goldman Sachs-Citigroup gang that backed her and Obama? \\nIf the party is to be recaptured, now is the moment to move. The 2016 election sounded the death knell for the identity politics. Its aim was to persuade voters not to think of their identity in economic terms, but to think of themselves as women or as racial and ethnic groups first and foremost, not as having common economic interests. This strategy to distract voters from economic policies has obviously failed. \\nIt did not work with women. In Florida, only 51 percent of white women are estimated to have voted for Hillary. It didn’t even work very well in ethnic Hispanic precincts. They too were more concerned about their own job opportunities. \\nThe ethnic card did work with the blacks (although not so strongly; fewer blacks voted for Hillary than had showed up for Obama). Under the Obama administration for the past eight years, blacks have done worse in terms of income and net worth than any other grouping, according to the Federal Reserve Board’s statistics. But black voters were distracted from their economic interests by the Democrats’ ethnic-identity politics. \\nThis election showed that voters have a sense of when they’re being lied to. After eight years of Obama’s demagogy, pretending to support the people but delivering his constituency to his financial backers on Wall Street. “Identity politics” has given way to the stronger force of economic distress. Mobilizing identity politics behind a Wall Street program will no longer work. \\nIf we are indeed experiencing a revival of economic class consciousness, who should lead the fight to clean up the Democratic Party Wall Street leadership? Will it be the Wall Street wing, or can Bernie and perhaps Elizabeth Warren make their move? \\nThere is only one way to rescue the Democrats from the Clintons and Rubin’s gang. That is to save the Democratic Party from being tarred irreversibly as the party of Wall Street and neocon brinkmanship. It is necessary to tell the Clintons and the Rubin gang from Wall Street to leave now . And take Evan Bayh with them. \\nThe danger of not taking this opportunity to clean out the party now \\nThe Democratic Party can save itself only by focusing on economic issues – in a way that reverses its neoliberal stance under Obama, and indeed going back to Bill Clinton’s pro-Wall Street administration. The Democrats need to do what Britain’s Labour Party did by cleaning out Tony Blair’s Thatcherites. As Paul Craig Roberts wrote over the weekend: “Change cannot occur if the displaced ruling class is left intact after a revolution against them. We have proof of this throughout South America. Every revolution by the indigenous people has left unmolested the Spanish ruling class, and every revolution has been overthrown by collusion between the ruling class and Washington.” [1] Otherwise the Democrats will be left as an empty shell. \\nNow is the time for Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and the few other progressives who have not been kept out of office by the DNC to make their move and appointing their own nominees to the DNC. If they fail, the Democratic Party is dead. \\nAn indication of how hard the present Democratic Party leadership will fight against this change of allegiance is reflected in their long fight against Bernie Sanders and other progressives going back to Dennis Kucinich. The past five days of MoveOn demonstrations sponsored by Hillary’s backer George Soros may be an attempt to preempt the expected push by Bernie’s supporters, by backing Howard Dean for head of the DNC while organizing groups to be called on for what may be an American “Maidan Spring.” \\nPerhaps some leading Democrats preferred to lose with their Wall Street candidate Hillary than win with a reformer who would have edged them out of their right-wing positions. But the main problem was hubris. Hillary’s coterie thought they could make their own reality. They believed that hundreds of millions of dollars of TV and other advertising could sway voters. But eight years of Obama’s rescue of Wall Street instead of the economy was enough for most voters to see how deceptive his promises had been. And they distrusted Hillary’s pretended embrace of Bernie’s opposition to TPP. \\nThe Rust Belt swing states that shifted away from backing Obama for the last two terms are not racist states. They voted for Obama twice, after all. But seeing his support Wall Street, they had lost faith in her credibility – and were won by Bernie in his primaries against Hillary. \\nDonald Trump is thus Obama’s legacy. Last week’s vote was a backlash. Hillary thought that getting Barack and Michelle Obama to campaign as her surrogates would help, but it turned out to be the kiss of death. Obama egged her on by urging voters to “save his legacy” by supporting her as his Third Term. But voters did not want his legacy of giveaways to the banks, the pharmaceutical and health-insurance monopolies. \\nMost of all, it was Hillary’s asking voters to ignore her economic loyalty to Wall Street simply to elect a woman, and her McCarthy-like accusations that Trump was “Putin’s candidate” (duly echoed by Paul Krugman). On Wednesday, Obama’s former Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul tweeted that “Putin intervened in our elections and succeeded.” It was as if the Republicans and even the FBI were a kind of fifth column for the KGB. Her receptiveness to cutting back Social Security and steering wage withholding into the stock market did not help – especially her hedge fund campaign contributors. Compulsory health-insurance fees continue to rise for healthy young people rise as the main profit center that Obamacare has offered the health-insurance monopoly. \\nThe anti-Trump rallies mobilized by George Soros and MoveOn look like a preemptive attempt to capture the potential socialist left for the old Clinton divide-and-conquer strategy. The group was defeated five years ago when it tried to capture Occupy Wall Street to make it part of the Democratic Party. It’s attempt to make a comeback right now should be heard as an urgent call to Bernie’s supporters and other “real” Democrats that they need to create an alternative pretty quickly so as not to let “socialism” be captured by the Soros and his apparatchiks carried over from the Clinton campaign. \\nNotes. \\n[1] Paul Craig Roberts, “The Anti-Trump Protesters Are Tools of the Oligarchy,” November 11, 2016.

       "  'Foreign Policy Scotland\\'s Secretary of State David Mundell (Photo by AFP) \\nScottish Secretary of State David Mundell has warned about the consequences of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU), saying Brexit would cut access to the single market. \\nMundell told members of the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that neither Scotland nor any other part of the UK was going to get a “special deal” during the negotiations with the EU. \\n\"So there are very specific issues to specific industries, but there won\\'t be special deals and it\\'s absolutely wrong to characterize a suggestion that certain areas of the country will get a special deal and Scotland will not,” he said. \\n“I accept on one level, if we are leaving the EU then essentially we are leaving the single market but access to the single market can, I think, continue in a way that doesn\\'t involve tariffs or barriers,” the secretary continued. \\nBritish and Scottish officials have long been engaged in a war of words over the Brexit process, with Scotland asking for an “equal” role in the negotiations. \\nDuring an EU referendum on June 23, Scotland voted 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the 28-member bloc, but Britons voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent. \\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has made it clear that she will complete the Brexit process by 2019 and that Scotland holds no veto over it. \\nScotland, in response, has threatened to secede from the UK in order to preserve its EU membership, which in turn guarantees the nation’s access to the EU single market. \\nLast year, Scotland’s first attempt for independence from the UK was blocked by voters in a referendum. \\nMundell told MSPs that the possibility of a second referendum was already harming Scottish businesses, even more than Brexit. \\n“It is already evident, because I understand that the surveyors organization have said there is a drop off in the take up of commercial property in Scotland,” he said. \\nExperts warn that in case of a hard Brexit, the UK may lose its preferential access to the EU\\'s single market and suffer from soured relations with other EU members.

       "  ' Putin-Obama Trust Evaporates\\nWhile the U.S. is investigating a potential covert Russian plan to throw a digital wrench in the 2016 election, one nominee has regularly praised their president Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama has expressed concern about cybersecurity to Putin amidst negotiations to curb common enemies in Syria. Sept. 9, 2016.\\nRay McGovern\\nOctober 31, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" Baltimore Sun \" - How did the \"growing trust\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his \"working and personal relationship with President Obama \" change into today\\x92s deep distrust and saber-rattling?\\nTheir relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the \"feverish\" state of international relations and lamented: \"My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.\" He complained about \"people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice\" and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a \"common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.\"\\nA month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, \"My good friend John Kerry is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry\\x92s] assurances that the US commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.\"\\nDo not chalk this up to paranoia. The U.S.-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire \\x96 not to mention statements at the time by the most senior US generals \\x96 were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia.\\nRelations between the US and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft \\x96 including any stealth aircraft \\x96 over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft.\\nIt seems possible that the US air force will challenge that claim in due course \\x96 perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, \"I wouldn\\x92t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.\"\\nInjecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia\\x92s warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a US or coalition aircraft.\\nMeanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the US is contributing \"a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team\" as a \"major sign of the US commitment to strengthening deterrence here.\"\\n\"This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,\" he explained, referring to NATO\\x92s July summit meeting in the Polish capital. \"The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.\"\\nOn Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the \"myth\" of a \"Russian military threat,\" calling this a \"profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.\"\\nMyth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia\\x92s borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against \"saber-rattling,\" adding that, \"We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.\"\\nSpeaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two and a half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d\\x92état in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia\\x92s reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by \"mainstream\" media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev, during which \"Yats\" (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington\\x92s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev.\\nThis unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, \"really the most blatant coup in history.\"\\nIt\\x92s time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now?\\nRay McGovern, like Sam Adams, began a career as a CIA analyst under President Kennedy; working on Vietnam, they became close associates. Sam was too straight-arrow to go to the media about the unconscionable fraud regarding the number of Communist forces. Ray knew that and rationalized not doing so himself.

       " ['7 Things You Need To Know About Trump Attorney General Pick Jeff Sessions | Daily Wire',\n",
       "  '7 Things You Need To Know About Trump Attorney General Pick Jeff Sessions By: Aaron Bandler November 18, 2016 \\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), who has long been a favorite of conservatives. The Democrats already have the long knives out for Sessions, spit-balling their usual accusations of racism–which should indicate that Sessions will be an effective attorney general. \\nHere are seven things you need to know about Sessions. \\n1. Sessions has a 78 percent liberty score on Conservative Review . Sessions has been in the Senate for 20 years, and has been described by the Washington Times as \"a tea partier before the tea party was cool,\" per Conservative Review \\'s biography . \\n2. Sessions has been one of the leaders in the Senate in fighting against amnesty. For instance, Sessions was among the most prominent members of the Senate leading the opposition to the Gang of Eight Bill. National Review , which dubbed Sessions \"amnesty\\'s worst enemy,\" explained how Sessions would reveal \"true facts\" about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadn\\'t decided how to vote on the legislation. Sessions and Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) would find other clever ways to oppose the bill, such as \"an amendment to a resolution honoring the late Latino union organizer Cesar Chavez\" in which Vitter noted Chavez\\'s opposition to illegal immigration, putting Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) in \"an awkward position.\" \\nIn 2015, Sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system, according to Conservative Review : Overturned the Zadvydas v. Davis Supreme Court case that Obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention Explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law Eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off DHS and DOJ law enforcement grants Expedited deportation of gang members Applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving Clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported (this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the Washington, D.C. “mansion murders”) \\nSessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration, as he has railed against it as \"the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States.\" \\n\"What we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together,\" Sessions wrote in a 2015 op-ed in the Washington Post . \\n3. Sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues. According to Conservative Review \\'s biography of Sessions: \\nIn January 2011, he was named Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee. In this capacity, he led the Republican charge against Majority Leader Harry Reid and Barack Obama for not offering a serious budget proposal, given that the Senate had not passed a budget since April 2009. He has fought guerilla warfare, often a lonely battle, against Democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps. He has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the Ryan-Murray budget deal. Sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state. \\nSessions has voted against the TARP bailout, stimulus bills, and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state \"with charts warning of the United States\\' \\'crippling\\' debt,\" per the Washington Post . \\n4. Sessions endorsed Trump early on. To the surprise of many in the establishment, Sessions endorsed Trump in February, declaring , \"I believe we are on a movement that must not fade away. This is a campaign, this is a movement. The American people are not happy with their government.\" \\nIt shouldn\\'t have come as a surprise though, given Session\\'s record on immigration and that Sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade. \\n5. Sessions is well-liked by his Senate colleagues on a personal level. According to the Washington Post : \\n\"Say what you will about him,\" former longtime Senate Democratic communications aide Jim Manley told the Almanac of American Politics. \"He was always nice to [the late Ted] Kennedy and other Democrats as well.\" \\nEven people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. Stanley-Becker talked to Susan Parker, a Democrat who tried to unseat Sessions in 2002. During a debate, she asked for a tissue and Sessions handed her one. She joked she would use it to dry her eyes when Sessions made her cry, and he responded: \"Please don’t say that. That’s my nightmare. I promise I’ll be nice.\" \\nIt\\'s no wonder then that Sessions will likely be confirmed by the Senate. \\n6. Accusations of racism against Sessions are absurd. When President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions, who at the time was a U.S. attorney, to a federal judge, the Democrats smeared Sessions with accusations of racism, which included: Calling a black attorney \"boy.\" Quipping about the Ku Klux Klan: \"I used to think they were OK, but they are pot smokers.\" Joking that a white attorney was \"a traitor to his race\" because he was collaborating with civil rights groups. Calling the NAACP and ACLU \"un-American.\" Prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud. \\nThe last point isn\\'t racist at all. The jokes, as Ben Shapiro has written , were made \"in front of the black lawyer; even the lawyer accusing Sessions of racism acknowledged that Sessions was joking.\" Clearly Sessions meant them as harmless jokes. Sessions has also denied calling the lawyer \"boy.\" The civil rights group Sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years. \\nSessions\\' record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism, as The Weekly Standard \\'s Mark Hemingway writes: \\nAs a U.S. Attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in Alabama. And he also prosecuted the head of the state Klan, Henry Francis Hays, for abducting and killing Michael Donald, a black teenager selected at random. Sessions insisted on the death penalty for Hays. When he was later elected the state Attorney General, Sessions followed through and made sure the Hays executed. The successful prosecution of Hays also led to a $7 million civil judgment against the Klan, effectively breaking the back of the KKK in Alabama. \\n7. As attorney general, Sessions would uphold the rule of law. The reason why Sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law. He has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty. Between that and his legal background as a U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general, there is every reason to believe that Sessions will follow the law and not politicize the Justice Department. \\n\"His interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but I predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor,\" Robert Driscoll , former deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in National Review . \"Clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor. Creative interpretations of the law may cease, but the meat-and-potatoes work of the division (intentional discrimination, police misconduct, disability law) will continue apace, conducted without impropriety or political favoritism. That alone will be a breath of fresh air.\" Tags '],\n",

       "  '\\nPosted by Alex Cooper | Nov 25, 2016 | Breaking News Hacking Group “Anonymous” Has Issued A CHILLING Announcement \\nSomething seriously bad is happening right now and it’s about to shift the face of democracy in the free world. \\nGeorge Soros is well known by now for his donations to BLM and other extreme leftist groups, not to mention the millions he’s given Hillary. \\nThings just went to code red though, because Jill Stein has just initiated a campaign to demand a recount of the vote. \\nWhat is about to happen could possibly cause a civil war. Anonymous, the infamous group responsible for hacking multiple high-level officials and agencies, just made a grave announcement: \\n“It’s over, folks. \\nThey are absolutely taking this from Trump. If you were able to see these stories they already have prepared for us to start running next week, your jaw would hit the ground. \\nThey are going to “find” that the results were indeed “hacked”. They have everything set in place, and have been ready to play this out for over a week. \\nAll 3 states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania) are going to be reversed and awarded to Hillary Clinton. Speculations are in the midst of who is pulling the strings, but this is undoubtedly going to happen. \\nStart preparing for the news to pour in, NOW. \\nWhen Michigan is reversed, it will send a clear message of irreversible corruption; the state had only paper ballots. Furthermore, the votes have already been certified. The stringent program was designed specifically to defend against cyber attacks.” \\nThere is already evidence that death threats were sent to multiple electors, but that didn’t work. Jill stein has already raised enough money to trigger a complete recount of the votes in Wisconsin—the other 2 states are even cheaper. This is BAD News \\nTrump may have taken Michigan, but it won’t matter. Jill Stein demanded a recount, and as a third party it will be carried out. The election WILL be rigged. January 20 th is literally 2 months away. Do you seriously think they are going to remain idle for 2 months? \\nI’m a realist—I call it like it is and I don’t care who I offend. But, do not be mistaken. This is BAD news. \\nIt’s already happening. Multiple fake “computer experts” have stated there are “anomalies” in the vote that favor Trump. Who have they blamed? Russia. \\nSo then what happened next? Jill Stein was able to push a recount order on these grounds. If foul play is “detected”, a recount can be initiated (even if the “foul play” is completely false and planned as a scapegoat to initiate the recount for Hillary). Rogue Hacking Groups Like Anonymous And WikiLeaks Gave Us A TREMENDOUS Amount Of Factual Information During The Election Race. This Warning Is Not To Be Taken Lightly. \\nBut wait a second. How is Jill Stein connected to Hillary and why would the recount benefit Clinton? The answer lies in a serious screw-up that became apparent when a bot was found in the donation system. \\nGo to the fundraising website and see for yourself! The campaign was started literally yesterday and already has over $4,000,000 in donations! This Is NO Coincidence. Do You Think A Man Who Has Spent BILLIONS Will Stop Now? The Media Is On His Side, Pushing The Entire Narrative! \\nThat’s not the scary part though. What gives away the entire operation is the behavior of the donations. The funding came in at an absolutely perfect $160,000 per hour. That wouldn’t be odd, except the donations continued full speed through the middle of the night when all of America was asleep! \\nJill Stein now has the money she needs to initiate the recount. Where did the funds come from? Soros. The mainstream media is pushing the narrative hard right now that the votes were hacked, even In Pennsylvania where that’s not even possible . \\nThey are openly and brazenly lying about everything. Google, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter are all censoring the spread of this information, creating dissent and misinformation. To make things even worse, the establishment has launched a campaign against “fake news”, allowing the mainstream media to dictate reality for hundreds of millions of Americans who receive constant news! \\nThis is BAD news people, and it’s about to get even worse. There is no reason they would be attempting to pull this stunt unless they had absolute certainty it would execute successfully. \\nPlease spread word of what is about to come. I will continue to keep you informed, but you must join me in this fight and spread word. This news is being suppressed on literally every channel. We must fight back. \\nAlex Cooper, CDP, Reports.

       " ['Critical Developments-Wikileaks, Huma’s Computer, Confirming Hillary Was Behind the Murder of Ambassador Stevens',\n",
       "  'Comments Wikileaks is about to confirm the story that The Common Sense Show told four years ago in that Ambassador Stevens was set up to die because his stories of gun-running, child trafficking and drug-running on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency in order to promote regime change in Libya using terrorists funded by these illegal activities, were leaking out and it was only a couple of months until the election. Ambassador Stevens had to be silenced. And Petraeus had to be put in a place where he was not forced to testify before Congress because he could not take the fifth before Congress. From Beforeitsnews: At the same time, Clinton was broadcasting Stevens whereabouts and she refused to provide the extra protection Stevens was so desperately requesting. Being that Stevens was working for the CIA, then head of the CIA, David Petraeus, would have known about Chris Stevens activities. To protect Obama’s 2012 election, both Stevens and Petraeus had to be gone. People are asking me how I knew all of this four years ago and I say, “I had a deep cover source from inside one of the military/intelligence services who wanted the real truth to be told. Somebody who knew this nation could not afford to let Clinton ever become President”. Now, I am getting confirmation from Wikileaks and others who have reached the same conclusion I did four years ago. Dear Mr. Hodges, This is to inform you that Wikileaks will soon, or has released Clinton emails which will demonstrate the following: The above is already appearing on the Internet in several places. It is clear that Putin would be a fool to allow Clinton and her gang of thugs to continue with their plan. Every time Clinton sags in the polls, she starts talking about 9/11. The evidence is beginning to line up that Clinton interests had motive to commit 9/11. No wonder Clinton tries to blame the Russians for everything, she is the main culprit on the world being brought to the precipice of World War III. It is a gratifying feeling when the dots start to connect. The Aaron Klein Revelations: Aaron Klein, the Breitbart Bureau Chief for Jerusalem revealed, in a Breitbart publication dated March 1, 2016, revealed that “the email from April 10th, 2011, the State Department employee, Timmy Davis, forwarded an email to the server by Clinton’s aide, Huma Abedin.” Please note that the time of this revelation, Huma Abedin, was not yet a household name. The series of emails will eventually have catastrophic consequences for Ambassador Stevens. “An email containing the whereabouts and plans of murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens passed through Hillary Clinton’s private server, dispatches released Monday in the final group of messages from Clinton’s emails reveal.” \\nBelow are some examples of the allegations posed by Klein and these are not empty charges as Klein offered as proof, the following emails. \\n“A March 27, 2011 email released last year was titled, “Chris Stevens mission.” It divulged: “The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage offshore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days. \\nAn April 8, 2011 email was forwarded to Clinton revealing the “security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as required.” \\nAn April 22, 2011 email revealed Stevens was on the road: “I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.” \\nAn April 24, 2011 email has the exact time of a Stevens meeting: “”Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving into a villa, but that is some way off.” \\nIf later emails are released, I have no doubt, that we will see that Clinton was transmitting Stevens location up until the time of the attack upon the Benghazi compound and this explains why some of these emails are not being released. However, at some point, they will see the light of day. \\nThe release of travel information, in any form, is a felony! Remember, the Stevens travel plans are classified and they came from Clinton’s private server. A casual Law and Order fan could make the causal connections between the release of these emails and Stevens death. This is absolute evidence that Clinton not only is guilty of multiple felonies, she is an accomplice to murder! '],\n",
       " ['FBI Sources: INDICTMENT in Hillary Investigation is ‘LIKELY’ | Top Right News',\n",
       "  'E-mail \\nby Jason DeWitt | Top Right News \\nThings just went from bad to much worse for Hillary Clinton as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) expands its investigation of the corrupt Clinton Foundation. \\nFox News Channel’s Bret Baier reported stunning developments about the Foundation investigation from two sources inside the FBI — including that an “indictment” is “likely” is the case. \\nBaier reveals five important new pieces of information in these two short clips. \\nThe details: \\n1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year. \\n2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time. \\n3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton’s secret server on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature. \\n4. Sources within the FBI have told Baier that an indictment is “likely” in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, “barring some obstruction in some way” from the Justice Department. \\n5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton’s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information have been taken from it. \\nTranscript: \\nBRET BAIER: Breaking news tonight — two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations into the Clinton emails and the Clinton Foundation tell Fox the following: \\nThe investigation looking into possible pay-for-play interaction between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Foundation has been going on for more than a year. Led by the white collar crime division, public corruption branch of the criminal investigative division of the FBI. \\nThe Clinton Foundation investigation is a, quote, “very high priority.” Agents have interviewed and reinterviewed multiple people about the Foundation case, and even before the WikiLeaks dumps, agents say they have collected a great deal of evidence. Pressed on that, one sources said, quote, “a lot of it,” and “there is an avalanche of new information coming every day.” \\nSome of it from WikiLeaks, some of it from new emails. The agents are actively and aggressively pursuing this case. They will be going back to interview the same people again, some for the third time. \\nAs a result of the limited immunity deals to top aides, including Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, the Justice Department had tentatively agreed that the FBI would destroy those laptops after a narrow review. We are told definitively that has not happened. Those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington, D.C. and are being exploited. \\nThe source points out that any immunity deal is null and void if any subject lied at any point in the investigation. \\nMeantime, the classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through former Democratic Congressman Anthony Wiener’s laptop and have found e-mails that they believe came from Hillary Clinton’s server that appear to be new, as in not duplicates. \\nWhether they contain classified material or not is not yet known. It will likely be known soon. All of this just as we move inside one week until election day. \\nBaier gives more details to Fox News Channel’s Brit Hume. \\nTranscript: \\nBRET BAIER: Here’s the deal: We talked to two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations. One: The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far… Several offices separately have been doing their own investigations. \\nTwo: The immunity deal that Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, two top aides to Hillary Clinton, got from the Justice Department in which it was beleived that the laptops they had, after a narrow review for classified materials, were going to be destroyed. We have been told that those have not been destroyed — they are at the FBI field office here on Washington and are being exploited. . \\nThree: The Clinton Foundation investigation is so expansive, they have interviewed and re-interviewed many people. They described the evidence they have as ‘a lot of it’ and said there is an ‘avalanche coming in every day.’ WikiLeaks and the new emails. \\nThey are “actively and aggressively pursuing this case.” Remember the Foundation case is about accusations of pay-for-play… They are taking the new information and some of them are going back to interview people for the third time. As opposed to what has been written about the Clinton Foundation investigation, it is expansive. \\nThe classified e-mail investigation is being run by the National Security division of the FBI. They are currently combing through Anthony Weiner’s laptop. They are having some success — finding what they believe to be new emaisls, not duplicates, that have been transported through Hillary Clinton’s server. \\nFinally, we learned there is a confidence from these sources that her server had been hacked. And that it was a 99% accuracy that it had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that things had been taken from that… \\nThere has been some angst about Attorney General Loretta Lynch — what she has done or not done. She obviously did not impanel, or go to a grand jury at the beginning. They also have a problem, these sources do, with what President Obama said today and back in October of 2015… \\nI pressed again and again on this very issue… The investigations will continue, there is a lot of evidence. And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment. \\nHillary is facing massive consequences for her misdeeds, which voters would do well to consider before electing her president. \\nPLEASE SHARE this if you agree Hillary belongs in a prison cell…NOT the Oval Office… '],\n",

       " ['How To Build A Cute Bee Hotel To Help Out Their Population » The Event Chronicle',\n",
       "  'It’s easier and even more fun than it seems. \\nBy Brianna Acuesta \\nWhile most people know and talk about honeybees , which live in a self-made hive together, few people seem to be concerned about the species of bees that are actually native to North America and easier to help out. There are many other species, such as the mason bees and leafcutter bees, that are critical to pollination and are suffering from habitat loss. \\nSince these bees are solitary creatures, their presence wouldn’t be overwhelming and these hotels can be created in your backyard without posing a risk of attracting hundreds at a time. The native bees require a lot less to be comfortable, as Becky Griffin, community and school garden coordinator at the Center for Urban Agriculture and University of Georgia Extension for the Northwest District of Georgia, said, \\n“Native bees nest in hollow logs, dead trees and in the ground, and when the forest is clean cut, the native bees have fewer and fewer places to nest.” \\nAs spaces to build their homes dwindle, so does the population of bees needed to keep the continent’s plants pollinated and healthy. By building a nesting site, you can contribute to the health of the population, and, according to Griffin, it’s very rewarding as well. \\n“Once you start noticing native bees, attracting them and learning about them, you’ll just want to sit on your bench in your garden and watch them work,” enthused Griffin. “They are amazing creatures!” \\nBelow is a guide to building the hotel , with advice from Griffin and answers to frequently asked questions. Basic Hotel Design \\nThe essential part of building the hotel is to have the right design down. You can decorate it any way you want, but there are a few guidelines to keep in mind. Some people use just one 4×4 block of wood with wholes drilled into it and mount it on a high enough post, while others use bamboo pieces with closed off ends of the tube. Others, as you’ll see below, have put together much bigger structures that aren’t necessary for your first hotel but definitely much appreciated by the bees. Here are the basic rules to follow: Use only untreated wood. Make sure the house has a roof to keep rain and other weather elements out of the holes. The house should be a minimum of three feet off the ground. To attract as many species of bees as possible, drill holes of varying sizes. Be sure not to drill all the way through the block as the holes must have a stopping point. Drill bits ranging from 2 mm to 10 mm in diameter are ideal. Beginners who might want to keep things really simple and who might have a limited amount of tools could simply use a 5/16 drill bit for all the holes in their first hotel. For a first hotel, 12-18 holes would be ideal. There are no hard-and-fast rules on how deep the holes should be — with the caveat that if you use a large piece of wood or create a “grand” framed hotel and the holes are too long, the bee may not enter it. Keeping entry holes no deeper than the length of a standard drill bit is a good rule of thumb. Remove splinters from the holes. When you drill the holes, take a piece of sandpaper and smooth out the holes. Small splinters may not seem like much to you, but rough edges in the entry holes could be a big deal and even fatal to a native bee, some of which are very tiny. Rough edges can even deter bees from using the hole. Whatever style of wood you’re using for your bee hotel will need to be replaced every two years or so because the bees want new tunnels in which they can lay their eggs. Resist the urge to paint the hotel. Natural wood is more attractive to the bees. You can have multiple bee hotels. Just be sure to space them out in your yard and garden so they aren’t clustered together. Frequently Asked Questions What kind of bees will visit the hotel? \\nSolitary bees, most commonly mason bees, will visit the hotel because they enjoy making their nests in hollow reeds or holes in wood. Different types of bees will use different materials to close up their holes once they have laid eggs, and they typically leave soon afterwards because they don’t rely on a social structure to rear their young. Fortunately, solitary bees are unlikely to ever sting you unless you accidentally step on one and get the stinger caught in your foot. \\nNo honeybees will be visiting, as they live in hives with a complex social structure in a bee-made home. No honey will be produced in the hotel, and huge clusters of bees won’t be invading the area. Can I build it? \\nConsidering the ease with which most people can use a hammer, nails, and drill, the answer is typically “Yes, you can build it.” If you want to make it easier on yourself when you’re starting out, you can use bamboo for the holes. When and where the place the hotel: \\nSince native bees nest in the spring, the bee hotel should be up and ready in February. If you live in a harsher region, you can wait until you’re able to dig a post hole into the ground when spring rolls around. \\nThe bees prefer sunny locations, with the holes faced towards the sun and away from high traffic areas. The sun keeps the developing bees warm and it’s dangerous for bees to cross sidewalks or garden paths once they emerge. What to watch for: \\nKeep an eye out for the arrival of the bees, as females will flock to the hotel in the spring or early summer and enter the holes. You can watch them put their nest together and tell what kind of bee it is based on the materials they use. Mason bees use mud to seal their holes and leafcutter bees use leaves. \\nThough it will all happen behind closed doors (or closed mud/leaves, more accurately), the eggs the females have laid will hatch and eat the food that the female has left behind. They will then spin a cocoon and the fully-formed bee will emerge and chew its way through the mud or leaves to enter the real world. This takes about a year, so you’ll see them emerge the next spring. If there is no pollen or nectar plants nearby, they will likely move away to an area rich with the food they need. If you want to keep the bees in your yard, you can work with extension agents in your area to plant the right things to encourage bees to stay. \\nBy checking with your local garden center, you can also find plants that are native to your area and likely to thrive and attract bees. Keep track of the types of bees you see in your garden to find patterns in their movements and preferences. How to measure success: \\nIf you see sealed holes in your bee hotel, you know you’ve been successful. If you notice that holes of a particular size are used most often, you can add more holes of that size to future bee hotels or even renovate your current one. If you have the right nectar or pollen in your garden, you’ll see bees flock to them. \\nIf you notice that during the summer one year after the holes were sealed that they are still sealed, then you have a problem that needs to be addressed. If there are tiny holes in the seal, then a parasite may have entered and eaten the larvae or bees. If there are no holes, a fungus could have killed the dwellers. The bees may have also been too cold if they are not faced towards the sun. Work with an extension agent to figure out what could have gone wrong. \\nFor more in-depth instructions on ways to build a hotel, visit The Pollinator Garden. \\nWould you consider building a bee hotel?

       " ['Hillary and Bill Clinton: The «Bonnie and Clyde» of American Politics',\n",
       "  \"Wayne MADSEN | 03.11.2016 | WORLD Hillary and Bill Clinton: The «Bonnie and Clyde» of American Politics Whether the information originated from hacked e-mails and computer files or Freedom of Information Act requests, the revelations about the political and business activities of Hillary and Bill Clinton and their cronies hearken back to another era, the Great Depression of the 1930s and the crime spree of another unscrupulous couple: bank robbery desperados Bonnie and Clyde. Aside from Hillary Clinton running her own lucrative «off-the-books» foreign policy via her private email servers and e-mail chain of associates and flunkies, it was her and her husband’s joint Clinton Foundation and Teneo Capital operations that scream out the word «corruption.» The servers were merely a mechanism by which the Clintons ran their own «pay-to-play» racketeering operation, something that would have been the envy of a contemporary of Bonnie and Clyde, Chicago crime boss Al Capone. Teneo, which runs a hedge fund operation and a «private intelligence» service jam-packed with former Central Intelligence Agency operatives, is where Mrs. Clinton’s «gal pal» and aide Huma Abedin worked simultaneously to her government employment with the State Department. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s probe of 650,000 emails found on the laptop computer of disgraced former New York Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Abedin, is but the proverbial tip of the iceberg. While FBI agents pore through Abedin’s emails that were discovered on the laptop and looking Mrs. Clinton’s emails that were either not destroyed by her aides or which were never accounted for, the real story is the FBI’s investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Teneo. Five FBI field offices are investigating the racketeering of the foundation and the foreign connections of Teneo. The offices include New York; Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Miami. Little Rock is the home of the Clinton Foundation, while New York is the home base of Teneo. The addition of the Miami field office to the Clinton probe is significant. One of Teneo Intelligence’s many global offices is located in Bogota, Colombia. A secretive Colombian private equity fund, «Fondo Acceso», financed by Mexican mega-billionaire Carlos Slim and Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra, is run out of the Clinton Foundation’s Bogota office. Tracking the money being fed into the Clinton Foundation may include proceeds from the illegal narcotics traffic in Colombia and other nearby countries. The Bogota activities of the Clinton Foundation, «Fondo Acceso», which ironically means «Access Fund», and Teneo appear to be concentrated in the Chico Business Park in the Colombian capital. Therefore, the involvement of the Miami office, in investigating Clinton Foundation funding, including the major donations from Slim and Giustra, makes a world of sense. Teneo was co-founded by longtime Bill Clinton associate Doug Band, who served in Clinton’s White House Counsel’s Office and later as Clinton’s chief aide in the Clinton Foundation and its associated Clinton Global Initiative. Band’s brother is Bill Clinton’s medical doctor who accompanies the ex-president on foreign trips. Doug Band was the point person who lobbied the incoming Barack Obama administration in 2008 to appoint Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. Mrs. Clinton’s tenure at State ensured that there was little separation between her department, the Clinton Foundation and Global Initiative, and Teneo. Abedin served as Mrs. Clinton’s «transition team» leader as the Secretary of State left the department to launch her presidential candidacy after the November 2012 election. From that time on, Mrs. Clinton, Abedin, Doug Band, Clinton’s campaign chief John Podesta, and others engaged in an email flurry to 1) ensure that the files in the private servers were either scrubbed or sanitized; 2) to officially sever all links between them and the Clinton Foundation and Teneo; and 3) to paint a picture for the public that all was well and legal with Mrs. Clinton’s term as America’s chief foreign policy executive. Unfortunately, the entire Clinton team has been exposed with the publication of emails from Mrs. Clinton’s swearing in as Secretary of State in 2009 to after she launched her campaign for the White House in 2013. The picture painted by the emails is one of modern-day gangsters milking everything they possibly could out of supposed public service. The FBI’s New York field office is also likely looking at Teneo’s dealings with other Clinton allies. It was Teneo that advised former New Jersey Democratic Governor Jon Corzine's MF Global investment firm as it was collapsing amid charges of major fraud by Corzine, a Clinton loyalist. It is also known as Mrs. Clinton communicated with President Obama over her private server and that Obama used a pseudonym. Obama lied to the American people when he stated that he first learned of the existence of Mrs. Clinton’s server from news media reports. There is little wonder why Obama has refused to condemn FBI director James Comey for re-launching his probe of the Clinton emails, based on the discovery of the additional traffic on Weiner’s laptop. Presidents who dug themselves deep into scandals by lying about «what they knew and when they knew it» helped sink the administration of Richard Nixon and almost cost Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton their presidencies. Obama was wise not to interfere in the FBI’s many criminal cases now building up like a tidal wave against Mrs. Clinton. The many Clinton scandals also involve the illegal shipment of U.S.- and foreign-manufactured weapons to jihadist rebels in Libya and Syria against U.S. law. When Clinton and Abedin oversaw the jihadist rebellions in both countries, the U.S. was subject to imposing a United Nations arms embargo directed against both civil war theaters. The sudden decision on October 5, 2016, by the Justice Department to drop all charges against the State Department-licensed Turi Defense Group of Arizona and its owner, Marc Turi, for violating U.S. law by shipping unregistered weapons to Libyan rebels, some of which were transferred to Syrian rebels by the CIA station in Benghazi, indicates that Attorney General Loretta Lynch wanted the Turi case to disappear before the November 8th election. The federal trial of Turi and his company was due to begin on November 8th. The indictment of Turi was brought in the U.S. Court for the District of Arizona in Phoenix. Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport was the scene of an impromptu and highly-questionable tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lynch on June 27, 2016. Turi claims that approval for the secret weapons shipments to Libya and onward to Syria were personally approved by Mrs. Clinton and had a green light from the CIA. Any new email or other evidence that Mrs. Clinton authorized illegal weapons shipments to jihadist terrorists would have required the FBI to broaden its investigation of both Hillary and Bill Clinton, as well as Lynch. Mrs. Clinton may have violated federal law by permitting the shipment of weapons to belligerent parties in Libya and Syria; Mr. Clinton may have obstructed justice in talking to the Attorney General; and Lynch may have violated her oath of office in misusing her position as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct justice. The Clinton scandal, in many ways, resembles the Iran-Contra episode more than it does Watergate. In Watergate, the cover-up by Nixon and his cronies, in many respects, was worse than the original crimes. In Iran-Contra, the arms and drugs smuggling crimes were equal to the cover-up, including the criminal role of then-Vice President George H. W. Bush in the entire affair. With the Clintons’ «E-mailgate», shipping U.S. weapons to terrorists and accepting foreign campaign donations from dodgy regimes in Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Qatar are every bit as bad as the obvious ensuing cover-up by Hillary Clinton and her and her husband's cronies. If these many cases are what the FBI and its offices in Washington, New York, Little Rock, Los Angeles, Miami, and possibly Phoenix, are now looking at, the FBI director had every right and a constitutional responsibility to inform Congress and the voting public. And FBI director Comey has every right not to tip off to the Clinton gang what he and the bureau may have on them, evidence demanded now by Mrs. Clinton and her supporters. This evidence may become material to the impeachment of Mrs. Clinton from the office of president of the United States should she be elected on November 8 th . \"],\n",

       " ['Egypt and Saudi Arabia’s Disagreements as a Reflection of the Middle East Problems | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Egypt On November 11, Egypt’s Minister of Finances Amr El-Garhy reported that the Arab Republic of Egypt (ARE) is to obtain a loan worth $12 billion from the International Monetary Fund. Egypt, which is facing a severe economic crisis, desperately needs this money. 40% of over 80 million citizens of the country are on the poverty line, while 51.2% of the youth are unemployed. In November 2016, this unfortunate situation further deteriorated. Due to financial problems, the budget deficit, and the tough terms set by the IMF for granting loans, Egypt’s President Abdel el-Sisi had to liberalize the Egyptian pound (the currency rate dropped to 18 pounds per dollar from the previous 12 pounds) and increase prices for petrol, diesel fuel, and fuel oil sharply at differing rates. It is quite a risky step to make on the eve of the cold season, especially when the country imports a lot of energy sources and food products. This measure is desperate and driven by several circumstances. Let us start with the fact that the economic situation deteriorated because of the terror unleashed by the Muslim Brotherhood after the overthrow of their leader M. Morsi in summer 2013, which led to a sharp reduction in revenues from the tourist industry and an outflow of investment – the most important sources of the country’s wealth. But this is not the sole reason. The sharp deterioration of the situation was partially caused by the suspension of the deliveries of 700 thousand tons of diesel fuel, petrol, and fuel oil to Egypt by Saudi Arabia under preferential terms (a loan at 2% per annum with a 3 years grace period) since late September. As it is well known, these agreements, as well as Saudi Arabia’s promise to provide Egypt with large-scale aid worth 24 billion dollars in order to support the Egyptian pound rate, were reached during King Salman’s visit to Cairo in April. At that time, this visit was called a historic. Riyadh, which is also experiencing economic difficulties due to an almost three-fold drop in oil prices since the end of 2014, agreed to undertake these expenses for a variety of reasons. The major reason is that the Saudi monarchy considers Egypt the main counteraction tool to Iranian influence in all its forms. The overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood regime was supported by Riyadh due to fears that M. Morsi would develop relations with Tehran, which is considered Riyadh’s main geopolitical, economic, ideological, and military enemy. By paying a huge sum of money to Cairo, the Saudi monarchy wanted to secure certain things in return. First of all, the Tiran and Sanafir Islands, which have a strategic position in the Red Sea close to the Gulf of Aqaba. Control over them means control over all ships entering and departing from the ports of Israel and Jordan, as well as over the flow of oil tankers (including those from Iran) passing through the Suez Canal. Another important objective was to encourage Egypt to side with Saudi Arabia in Yemen, where Riyadh has been conducting a tough and no-win military campaign since March 2015. The Egyptian Air Forces have in fact joined this campaign but they have only managed to secure an air-exclusion zone in Yemen so far. Ultimately, by using Cairo’s economic problems, the Saudis intended to subordinate Egypt to its own end and force it to abandon its claims to leadership in the Arab world and pass its role to Riyadh. The past six months have demonstrated that the Saudis are dissatisfied with the behaviour of the Egyptian leadership, which has taken money but has not met the expectations. As it turned out, the Egyptians are not going to transfer these islands in the Red Sea to its “legal owner”. While the official media state that Tiran and Sanafir have always belonged to Saudi Arabia and they were leased to Egypt in 1950, lawyers and public leaders in Egypt have other versions: the Maritime Border Accord signed between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire in 1906 acknowledges Egypt’s sovereignty over these islands. As a result, the case of transferring the islands is dragging on in the courts. Egypt’s Administrative Court under the ARE State Council upheld the previous court decision that invalidated the agreement signed in April regarding the transfer of the islands to Saudi Arabia, and the appeal of the government was dismissed. However, the State Affairs Committee disputed these decisions, and the Court of Urgent Matters suspended the judgement of the Administrative Court in September. Even if the government manages to change the situation within the legal framework, public opinion within Egypt strongly opposes the transfer of the islands and A. el-Sisi has to take this fact into account. In addition, Egypt has not changed its position in respect of the Yemeni crisis and, apparently, has not increased its contribution to the Yemeni military campaign. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia does not want its soldiers to fight on the territory of Yemen. Cairo is not following the weird twists of Saudi diplomacy in Libya as well. Since June 2016, Chief of the Libyan Armed Forces, General, and now Marshal, Khalifa Haftar has ceased to please Riyadh while Cairo is actively using him to create a buffer zone between its border and members of the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other terrorist groups from all over the world who have occupied Western Libya (historical Tripolitania). However, the straw that broke the camel’s back for the Saudi royal family was Egypt’s voting for the draft Russian resolution on Syria in the UN Security Council in October (Cairo is a non-permanent member) and the demonstrative rapprochement of Cairo with Moscow: it led joint military training with the Russian party that were “not authorised” by Riyadh, made the decision to acquire Russian KA-52 helicopters for the Mistral helicopter carriers originally built for Russia but later obtained by the Egyptians using Saudi funds (as rumour has it in the two capitals). Moreover, Cairo refused to condemn the actions of the Russian Aerospace Forces in Aleppo as demanded by Saudi Arabia. However, the sanctions against Egypt introduced by the Saudis have had a directly contrary effect on Cairo. The pound rate may have dropped and the economic situation may have deteriorated but Egypt has not abandoned its independent foreign policies. Rather on the contrary. Marshal Khalifa Haftar has solved a part of the fuel problems as he has been in control of the major oil fields in Libya since summer. The rest of the problems can be resolved by deliveries from other states, including Riyadh’s enemy Iran or even Azerbaijan (a Memorandum of Understanding has been signed with Azerbaijan’s SOCAR Company). It is no coincidence that on November 6, rumours appeared about an upcoming visit of Egypt’s Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla to Iran. They have not been confirmed yet, but there is no smoke without fire…the Egyptian leadership is definitely indicating that an alternative to rapprochement with the KSA exists… The breach between the two countries has not yet opened, the search for common ground and compromise is in progress, which is evidenced by the active mediating role played by the UAE that provides strong support to the Egyptian leadership. But it is already clear that D. Trump victory in the elections will give el-Sisi confidence in his goal of restoring the historical role of the Arab world’s leader, and Riyadh should have no illusions about this.

       " ['John Kerry’s Trip to the South Pole: Nazi Roots “Revisited”? | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World So why did the US Secretary of State John Kerry going to the South Pole, as US presidential elections were being held on November 8, 2016, and why was the news provided late in the game and as an unexpected surprise? One need to keep in mind that many US states allowed early voting, so millions of Americans had already cast their ballots beforehand; they and perhaps Kerry too did not have to be in their home districts on polling day, or perhaps he did not want to wait in long lines like in places like Ohio where the number of polling stations were reduced to keep some categories from voting. Presumably John Kerry is not one of these and his vote would have been counted. It will be remembered that Kerry stood for president himself, against George W. Bush, and would have beaten him if he had won Ohio, which he failed to do by only a few thousand votes. So you would imagine a man of such experience and seniority would be out on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton right until the polls close in the East of the country, which is when candidates traditionally claim victory or concede defeat. But Kerry wasn’t even in the country in November 8th. He was considered so important that he had been sent to – of all places – the South Pole. While the rest of his party was hard campaigning for Clinton he was chilling it at the US military-scientific facilities there, apparently looking into something to do with “ environmental policy ” which wasn’t part of his job description last time anyone looked. However, perhaps now, in retrospect, he knew the election results that many are now claiming was a total surprise—how all the poll results were wrong and the American people had spoken in rejecting the status quo, and all what Clinton and those who stand behind her stand for. Nonetheless, on a lighter note, no one knows the full extent of the US footprint in Antarctica as it is all classified. The bases there are known primarily for drug abuse, which was once widespread, with the US itself supplying the drugs to its own employees as it did in Vietnam. But Kerry’s visit there was unlikely to have influenced the outcome of the election, or indeed much else. Unless the US is willfully changing the environment of regional countries from its Antarctic bases it seems very odd that Kerry should have gone to the South Pole, and then followed up with a tour of the Southern hemisphere countries, to discuss such an issue at such an inopportune time. So why was Kerry sent to the South Pole, about as far away from the election as possible? There are plenty of possibilities, many of which are credible. But as ever, the most unlikely one is the most likely to be true – and it isn’t pretty. Poles not so far apart One day the performance artist Laurie Anderson decided she would go and visit the North Pole, just like that. She managed to get near it and found it was a restricted area, owned by the US military, so she couldn’t actually reach the pole itself . Anderson’s North Pole trip was in 1974. Five years later a New Zealand airliner crashed into one of the Antarctic mountains, or so we were told. As a result, all civilian over flights of the South Pole were also banned. The US doesn’t extend as far north as the North Pole, or as far south as the South Pole, but they have somehow become US-controlled territory regardless, part of the vast swathe of land where the US exacts different forms of taxation without giving the inhabitants representation. In Merab Ratishvili’s novel White Lama the leading character ends up going to the South Pole. He finds a gap in the ice and discovers a hidden colony of very tall psychics, who live in a temperate climate and grow tropical fruit trees . That is only a story, but it is based on a real event: the attempted Nazi colonisation of Antarctica in 1938. These characters are alleged to be descendants of those Nazis, maintained by foreign powers for the own purposes . For many years it has been rumoured that the Nazis built some sort of scientific-military base in Antarctica. They are most unlikely to have gone all that way on a fishing expedition. As their victims knew, the Nazis were very well-organised and efficient. We know for example that if they had invaded England they were intending to use the town of Bridgenorth as their UK operations base – a very sensible choice, as it is near the geographical centre of the UK, between its two main industrial hubs of the time and gives easy access to all the important cross-country transport and communications routes. Operation Highjump After the Second World War a number of leading Nazis were spirited away to the US on ratlines so that they would neither stand trial for their crimes or have their knowledge fall into the hands of the Russians. In 1947 US Admiral Richard E. Byrd led 4,000 American , British and Australian troops in an invasion of Antarctica called “Operation Highjump”. This and at least one follow-up expedition was called off because the troops came under attack by what are described as “flying saucers”. Even in the country whose citizens went running to the hills when Orson Welles told them that the Martians had landed their military do not run away from flying saucers. Why is the US unable to describe what forces were unleashed against the invasion force, and by whom? What truth is so frightening it has to be shrouded in science fiction terms in order for people to dismiss the reports? Whatever the Nazis did in Antarctica, the US probably found out about it. The US biolab in Tbilisi is one of a number of dubious former Soviet facilities it has taken over and turned into restricted areas in the same way. It would be in character for the US Antarctic base to have once been operated by a foreign power, and have been taken over for “scientific purposes” most self-respecting scientists would never touch, those with military applications the US always denies until it can gain political capital from them. Cats among the penguins Kerry does have an indirect connection with the Nazis. Like the Bush family, he too is part of the Skull n Bones secret society. George Bush Sr’s father, Prescott Bush, ran the Bank of America which financed the Nazi Party’s initial bid for power, and got its own money from somewhere. Antarctic expeditions cost a lot of money, particularly when a country is spending vast amounts on armament production preparing for war. Kerry may have a personal connection with whatever is going on down there now, which the US keeps strictly under wraps. But there are also precedents for sending important people to the South Pole at historic turning points, which this US election is bound to be, whoever wins. The most famous concerned Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty, Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President John F. Kennedy. He was on his way to the South Pole on a government mission at the time John F. Kennedy was shot, and for the rest of his life maintained that that was not a coincidence but a deliberate attempt to get him out of the way so that he could not impede what he later stated was a plot. Prouty retired from military service soon after the assassination, despite the siren call of the pension, and always maintained that the CIA assassinated Kennedy to prevent him taking it over after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba. He also maintained that the CIA itself answered to a shadowy global elite rather than the US government, and that this elite acts with impunity throughout the world. If so, it does so through secret societies, like Skull n Bones. As Colonel Prouty had worked in senior CIA roles for years he had considerable inside knowledge of how that organisation operated and who did what. He was dismissed as a crackpot, as all those who dispute the official version of the Kennedy assassination are, but his claim that Edward Lansdale, the basis of Burdick and Lederer’s novel The Ugly American, was present at the scene as one of the “Three Tramps” is perfectly consistent with what the public knows about Lansdale and his work, let alone what Prouty must have known. We should all hope that no one is planning a political assassination. But there is some reason why Kerry was being kept out of the way. We can speculate what his connections with the shadowy global elite are, but we know his connections with the US government. If the government wanted him out of the way on Election Day, with all his campaign experience, we can assume that whatever someone doesn’t want him to see, or he himself doesn’t want to be implicated in, involves the current US administration itself. He who knows least lives longest Though various Americans once claimed to have been the first man to reach the North Pole the claims of each one were disputed, largely by other Americans. The first people who undoubtedly reached the North Pole were the crew of the airship Norge, which flew over it in 1926. Their commander was Roland Amundsen, who had also famously been the first person to reach the South Pole in 1912, that time by land . Amundsen did not enjoy this triumph for long, as he disappeared along with his plane and five crewmen two years later. He was searching for the missing crew of the Airship Italia, commanded by one of his 1926 crew, Umberto Nobile. Neither most of Amundsen’s plane, or any of the bodies, have ever been found. The Airship Italia disaster aroused a lot of suspicion at the time and since. The Italian government refused to fund this polar flight. When the airship crashed one of the crew twice tried to commit suicide. The Italian ship supposedly monitoring the distress signals from the survivors ignored them and the Italian government made no attempt to rescue its stranded citizens. Eventually Captain Nobile and his pet dog were rescued while his men were left on the ice, most unusually, and many of these later disappeared without trace, just as Amundsen was later to do, having volunteered as a private citizen to lead a rescue attempt. Maybe Nobile himself didn’t know what his polar mission was supposed to accomplish. But it was clearly something people in high places did know, and were embarrassed by. Amundsen’s death left Nobile as the person who knew more about the two poles than anyone else, and he was subject to a smear campaign which had the effect of damaging anything he might say later, just as the one against Prouty did. Now we have a situation where the poles are considered so important that they are restricted areas controlled by the world’s only superpower. But few people fight over other inhospitable areas. This is why various Eskimo and desert peoples are allowed to continue their traditional way of life, rather than being forcibly “civilized” by great powers, as, for example, the highly cultured Tibetans are by the Chinese. This changes when energy resources are involved. But even then the oil and gas-rich zones do not become restricted. They may be taken over by big corporations working hand in glove with foreign governments, but what they are doing is trumpeted to the skies, not restricted to an inner circle which probably doesn’t include most of those carrying out the work. Frozen before the politicians get there John Kirby, the man who is trying to minimise terrorism and helping John Kerry prevent the Saudi government being prosecuted for their part in 9/11, was apparently expecting to go along with Kerry to the South Pole base when he gave his briefing. We do not know what is going on at the US South Pole base but we do know what is happening at some other US bases with a similar classified level. In each case, what we know is connected with terrorism: manufacturing biological weapons, arming and training terrorists, spying on the local population and then strangely failing to discover successful terrorist outrages in advance, despite the US admitting straight after them that it knows a great deal about the terrorists involved. At one time the Southern hemisphere wasn’t a problem to the US. A string of compliant democratic governments and military dictatorships kept things under control well enough, despite some local terrorist groups doing their best to remove them. It could concentrate on other parts of the globe, like the Middle East, and simply send in new diplomats, or CIA torture trainers, to sort out any government that started backsliding. Now the worm has begun to turn. The Broad Left remains in control of Uruguay, despite being composed of former urban guerrillas who were tortured by previous US-backed regimes. Philippines president Roberto Duerte is cosying up to China and telling the US it has lost an ally, and despite his backtracking on this in later statements his new deals with China remain in place . Chile and Paraguay have elected leaders determined to move on from the US-controlled past, and even Nauru, the tiny phosphate-rich but future-challenged Pacific state, is selling itself to the highest bidder, a new one every week, whatever the US thinks about it . So there are reasons Kerry wanted to go to the Southern hemisphere and find new levers of influence. But he doesn’t know whether he will be Secretary of State after the election, or who any new Secretary of State will report to. Whatever Kerry does now the new US president, Donald Trump, will just have to tolerate. Of course Kerry cannot take overtly political initiatives without knowing who the new president was going to be. But he started his diplomatic tour by having visited the South Pole – as mysterious, but nevertheless blatant, a command and control centre as the US has anywhere, as its own behaviour towards it makes clear. It may well be true that Kerry went to the South Pole to keep him away from something serious the US government or Soros funded NGOs are planning. But more likely his job may be to take actions which will forestall anything a new government might want to do—such as draining the swamp. Such actions are not likely to be legal or desirable actions if they began with a visit to the US South Pole base. Whoever Kerry was really working on a highly-contested election day remains a big question; it was likely someone whose interest is in a transparent government, rule of law which are the kind of things a real democratic system is supposed to stand for.

       " ['Cambodia – a Thorny Path to Elections | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Southeast Asia Two years remain until the parliamentary elections in Cambodia. This is a really rather short period considering that the position of the current political regime of the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) remains in doubt. Despite the Party’s success at the municipal elections in 2015, there is no confidence that it may win and retain power at the parliamentary elections. The CPP is overloaded with a host of problems. Primarily, everyone is talking about corruption in the party, its nepotism, detachment from the people, who analysts state have long tired of seeing one and the same governing figures at the top of Cambodia’s political hierarchy. There is even the feeling that the leadership of the Party won’t plan to renew its policy and introduce new leaders even if it recognizes its problems. In January 2015, at an emergency session of the CPP, it was noted that “the corruption, nepotism, abuse of powers, violation of the laws spread among the Party’s members had undermined the confidence of the people and raised doubts about its right to rule the country.” The introduction of reforms inside the Party and society was named as a life-and-death issue for the CPP’s future at the session. However, almost two years have passed since the session and the Party has not even started to solve its acute problems. There are no new young and attractive leaders in its leadership, yet the provincial level has rather competent and authoritative governors of provinces – CPP members that might change the image of the ruling party if they became members of its leadership. Despite the fact that the number of members of the Central Committee has doubled, it is still dominated by the same veterans of the People’s Revolutionary Party who together with Hun Sen and supported by Vietnam and the Soviet Union built the People’s Republic of Kampuchea (1979-1991). Over this period, they went from being “comrade” to “Mr” and became even more detached from real life. The style of the political leadership was supposed to be corrected, and the session would promote steps aimed at a symbolic detachment from the personal leadership of Hun Sen. These expectations were not met. Soon after the session, he took up the position of CPP Chairman and consolidated both administrative and party powers into his own hands. The relations of the authorities and the opposition have been developing in a complicated and ambiguous way. At first, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) headed by openly pro-Western and anti-Vietnam policy maker Sam Rainsy, which obtained only 12 seats fewer than the ruling party at the elections in 2013, boycotted the National Parliament in protest against the alleged falsification of the figures and violations that prevented their victory. Then, pro-Western nationalists agreed with Hun Sen to return to the Parliament and started active work aimed at spreading their influence in the rural areas by opening its branches in the traditional CPP territories and carrying out protests in their interest. This activity led by the opposition clearly frightened the ruling regime and Sam Rainsy emigrated while the other leader Kim Socha and his supporters were brought to justice for the organization of illegal anti-governmental protests. At the same time, Cambodia’s leader initiated propaganda attacks on the opposition leaders, organised protests demanding the resignation of its representatives from public offices. A number of opposition members were even beaten, which was followed by the initiation of criminal cases against them. The situation became so serious that the Deputies of the European Parliament threatened the authorities of Cambodia with suspending the provision of economic assistance. This is a serious warning for Hun Sen, as the European Union is one of the leading donors to Cambodia’s economy. As for the tactics of the opposition, it is now refraining from mass protest campaigns in order not to give the authorities reason to expand repressions. At the same time, using non-commercial organisations related to it and gaining Western subsidies, the opposition is generating the conviction in society that the ruling regime is against the people, and its leaders should be judged and their property should be confiscated. It also proposes a social and economic program that presupposes an increase in the minimum wage and retirement benefits, and a reduction in fuel and electricity prices. Though the program is purely populist and unreal, it is attracting people who have started to perceive the CNRP as a political force able to change the situation in the country. While assessing the situation in Cambodia and its prospects, it becomes clear that the People’s Party has no clear pre-election strategy and it is not mobilizing party members for successful elections. The elaboration and presentation of a pre-election strategy might influence those who have doubts about their preferences and those who have not decided how to vote in 2018. In September, I had a chance to talk with the delegation from Cambodia at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. I was interested in the mood in the People’s Party in the run-up to the elections. One of the high-ranking members of the delegation answered, “We are very scared”, which just confirmed that our conclusions were correct.

Moreover, the officials of these republics say that, without agreement on this matter, it is impossible to solve any other problems. \\nMeanwhile, Kiev is delaying decision-making on this issue. The talks are going very slowly and unproductively. \\nProvocations \\nIn addition, Kiev is continuing provocations against Russia. Despite the fact that Russia is not a party to the conflict and does not participate in these talks, Kiev’s provocations negatively affect the credibility of Ukraine and do not help the course of the group’s work. \\nJust recently, Kiev sent several groups of spies and saboteurs to Russia and kidnapped two Russian citizens. Now they are being detained with the possibility of ransom, which suggests that all of this was started for the sole purpose of at least slightly improving Ukraine’s deplorable financial condition. \\nThe neutral territory \\nDuring his visit to Moscow yesterday, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said that Belarus was a neutral party and would not support any of the conflict’s sides, despite the fact that Kiev has really done everything possible to foment bad relations with all of its neighbors, including even its traditional anti-Russian ally – Poland. \\nThe incident with the Belarusian aircraft, when Ukraine threatened to raise fighters against a passenger liner flying from Kiev to Minsk, did nothing good for the international image of Poroshenko, nor for Ukrainian-Belarusian relations, which until recently were considered to be even closer than relations between Minsk and Moscow. \\nExpectations \\nAll of these facts suggest that no high expectations should be held for the meeting. Most likely, Kiev will once again delay the solution of fundamental problems, confining itself to blackmail over prisoners of the DPR and the LPR.

       "  'on November 3, 2016 12:22 am · \\nDonald Trump’s deplorable supporters aren’t waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. \\nThey’ve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is “rigged” in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. \\nIn Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump’s stupid hats and a “Deplorables” T-shirt to vote. \\nElection code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. \\nOf course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don’t apply to them. \\nWell, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. \\nAt Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. \\nBut when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer’s hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. \\n“It just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who’s probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,” local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . “I think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they’re going to vote and so there’s nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.” \\nHere’s the video via KTVT . \\nFrankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism.

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nJohn Kirby has been spokesman for the US State Department since May 2015. In the short time he’s held the post, he’s produced one gaffe and embarrassment after another. Basically, he makes the previous ginger-haired smartass spokesgirl representing the United States, Jen Psaki, look like a genius. (Psaki left State to be Hillary’s spokesgirl at the White House, only to find herself in the center of a gaggle of devastated aides as Barack Obama acknowledged Donald Trump as president-elect.) \\nIn State’s latest charade, Kirby callously threw out more tired accusations of Russian aircraft bombing hospitals in Aleppo. The claims came from “credible relief organizations” — probably State/CIA fronts created precisely for the sole purpose of making such accusations. Probably a lot like the “Syrian Observatory for Human Rights,” which is still cited by western propagandists even after it was demonstrated to be a western intel op with literally 1 guy sitting in a UK flat making crap up. \\nWhen questioned by RT reporter Gayane Chichakyan to specify which hospitals, Kirby refused, referring to the “relief organizations.” He then demanded Chichakyan ask “her” defense ministry to own up to bombing the apparently fictional hospitals. When Kirby was derided by AP’s Matt Lee for his treatment of Chichakyan, he blustered, “ I’m not putting Russia Today on the same level with the rest of you. “ \\n[embedded content] \\nUnable to defend his ludicrous claims, Kirby went ad hominem, attacking RT as “state owned” – apparently forgetting that BBC, France24, Germany’s ARD and ZDF, and many other western broadcasters are state-owned or controlled. \\nIn summary, the exchange went like this: \\nKirby : Russia has bombed civilian hospitals in Aleppo! \\nRT : Which hospitals were bombed? \\nKirby : I don’t know, ask your defense ministry. \\nRT : If you tell us which ones, we can ask our defense minstry about them. \\nKirby : I don’t know which ones, ask the relief agences. \\nRT : Which relief agencies? \\nKirby : I don’t know which agencies…..and by the way, RT is state-owned! So there! \\nJohnny’s probably got a short fuse now that he knows his days of spinning out Ministry of Truth tripe are numbered. There is little prospect Donald Trump, who seeks rapprochement with Russia, will retain these useless, lying, neocon trained asshats in his administration. If they actually lied well, that would be a different story. But US diplomats are some of the worst fibbers in the business. Y ou almost have to pity the bastards. Maybe it’s because to tell a good lie, you need a least a kernel of truth. They have literally zero facts on their side to work with. \\nAltogether one more pitiful, pathetic performance by the US Department of State, and another disgrace to the United States. And, we hope, while looking forward to the next US administration with guarded optimism, one of the last. Related '],\n",
       " ['Vladivostok to Become a Pivotal Hub of the Asia-Pacific Region | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Russia in the World In August, 2016 the Chinese city of Changchun hosted the 21st summit of international exchange and cooperation of Northeast Asian regional administration officials. The forum was attended by delegations from Russia, China, Republic of Korea, Mongolia and Japan. High-ranking representatives of these states discussed important issues of trade, transport, and environment cooperation. It’s been reported that a considerable amount of attention was paid to the development of regional tourism, in which Russia’s Primorye will play a pivotal role. In particular, the possible creation of a permanent tourist route that will connect Primorye, the Republic of Korea, China and Japan attracted a lot of attention at the forum. The plans that were announced at the forum were soon put into motion, as the parties got down to work immediately. In October 2016 Primorye received a delegation from South Korea that arrived to discuss the details of the new project. The delegation was headed by Pak Tae-wook, the head of the Maritime tourism center of Kangwon Province, that announced that Vladivostok would soon become a pivotal hub for the Asia-Pacific v oyage tours . The capital of the Primorsky region has already received a cruise liner from South Korea back in May 2016. It’s been reported that Vladivostok produced a lasting effect on the passengers of the gorgeous Costa Victoria. It has become clear now that the development of tourism in Primorye can bring huge profits for both Russian and Korean governments. According to Park Tae-wook, in the course of the next year Costa Victoria will dock in Primorye six times. With the addition of charter flights and other cruise lines, it’s safe to say that Korean tourists will be visiting Vladivostok every month. In February 2017 the tourist route will encompass China’s Tianjin port, South Korea’s Busan and Sokcho, and Japan’s Sakayminato and Hakata. When the project becomes fully operation, the total number of cruise liners visiting Primorye will increase threefold. As it has been noted by Mr. Pak, a number of the upcoming Olympic Games in the region will provide this venture with additional momentum. The next three Olympics will be held in Asia, namely in South Korea, Japan and China. Against this background sea and air tourist traffic in the region is not simply getting more important but also more profitable. In general, it should be noted that as Vladivostok gradually transfroms into a pivotal hub of the Northeast Asia, it provides the whole of Primorye with economic benefits and investments. This has become possible due to the adoption of a law that would allow foreigners to stay up to 8 days in Vladivostok without a visa. According to the International Cooperation Department of the Primorsky Territory, this year Vladivostok is to be visited by more than 500 thousand foreign tourists. In addition to the Costa Victoria, Vladivostok has already harbored five foreign liners, including the German Artania, the Japanese Nippon Maru. In July, the capital of Primorye was visited for the first time by the famous cruise liner Sun Princess, that was traveling from Sydney to Tokyo, via Malaysia, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul. This huge ship, with its length of 261 meter can accommodate up to 2,200 passengers. Despite the fact that since there are much larger cruise liners, it remains one of most famous and comfortable tourist boats. The arrival of such a world-renowned vessel to Vladivostok is an indication that it’s gradualy becoming one of the key Asia-Pacific ports. Another important event in 2016 was the first visit to the seaside capital of China’s tourist liner Chinese Taishan. Despite the fact that it’s not nearly as big as the giant Sun Princess and that it is outfitted for middle-class travelers, the arrival of Chinese Taishan is a significant event nontheless. It should be recalled that due to the increase in the welfare of Chinese citizens overseas trips have become a sort of a trend in China, that may soon become a backbone to a stable tourist flow that will be growing every year. The last cruise ship to visit Vladivostok in 2016 was the Pacific Venus, that docked in this Russian port on 20 October. It traveled from Japan, whil making a short stay in the South Korean port of Busan. The Pacific Venus is one of the largest cruisers in the region and it is the second largest Japanese ship. Speaking about milestone events, one cannot overlook the reopening of a once popular ferry line: Sokcho (South Korea) – Zarubino (Russia) – Hunchun (China). A tripartite agreement that would allow this development to take place was signed during a meeting of NEA governors. Next summer a new ferry will be carrying more up to 1000 tourists along with large volumes of cargo between the above mentioned ports. The flow of foreign tourists to Zarubino will boom in February 2016 as the Ministry of Culture has already started an initiative to allow foreign tourist a no-visa stay in this port too. It’s hard to argue these days the notion that tourism should not be underestimated. In addition to the large profits that it brings in itself, it also contributes to the development of international cultural and trade relations. Tourism leads to the prosperity of a region, provides advertising, international prestige and the influx of investors. With regard to maritime travel routes, their development is inextricably linked with the development of shipping in general.

       " ['Syria: Theater of the Absurd Gets Crazier | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Syria \\nEurope today is a powder keg, and the leaders are like men smoking in an arsenal … A single spark will set off an explosion that will consume us all … Otto von Bismarck, Congress of Berlin, 1878 Just when you think the loons have emptied their bag of tricks we get a week like the past one to prove you are wrong. The alleged massacre of students and teachers in the village of Hass, at the hands of the Syrian or Russian Air Forces, has had several revisions already, the truth exposed in stages. When news of the attack first broke, we saw the crazies at the UN pouring gas on a totally unproven story, delivered to us by the flagrantly CIA Syrian Observatory news front. The initial claims were backed up by the “White Helmets”, another Western-NATO front supplying aid and comfort to the terrorists tormenting Syria under the guise of emergency workers and a multimillion NGO budget. These two “sources” have fed Western media a non-stop flow of alleged Damascus atrocity stories to make the casual observer think that Assad was competing with Attila the Hun for the world’s most bloodthirsty killer award. Professional journalist and mainstream media almost never validate the claims independently as it is too dangerous for them to do so in the land of the head choppers. The Russians had little to say formally the first day, unlike all those who instantly claimed to know what happened. As they usually do they checked with all their command resources to look into what had happened. The post-strike Russian drone surveillance found no bomb holes in the roof of the school, or craters anywhere near it. The initial photo analysis mentioned images taken at different time during the day and of different locations showing damage, indicating the Islamic State media crew was using its stock footage archive once again to create a phony atrocity story. And then comes Maria Zakharovah the following day to tell us, “An expert analysis of the photos of the Haas village in Syria revealed that there had been no air strike at the local school and that there had been no casualties. The photos are the products of computer graphics, and the killed schoolchildren are a horrible fantasy of ‘activists’ from Al-Jazeera and The Independent.” This news did not make the West very happy as they have walked away from the initial story like it never happened, which seems now was the case. I just checked Google and there is no updated Western media supporting the original faked version of events. Zakharovah’s press conference report of the hoax does not even show up on Google, no surprise there. Continuing on with Syria, we have just finished another chapter in that saga, of another failed ceasefire for humanitarian purposes, getting the wounded and civilians out, and badly needed aid in, only to find the US supported insurgents blocking both. We hear only six tons of supplies were delivered to civilians. But the “aid convoy”s must have been flowing somewhere. With the Syrian coalition planes staying ten kilometers away from Aleppo, once again the jihadis were able to get enough supplies to launch another major offensive on SW Aleppo with armored suicide vehicles, heavy artillery and armor. After making some initial gains the “assault” petered out and the Syrian countered attacked to recover most of the lost ground, and yet the Western press stories of Assad killing civilians in Aleppo continue to flow. The crazy award goes to the incredible media hype over the Russian flotilla heading to it station of the Syrian coast. It became a comedy like the American movie “The Russian are Coming!” The military and Intel factions of the NATO countries along the route spared nothing in their shameless Russian Bear mongering. Phil Butler did a wonderful piece on this story that I urge you all to read to enjoy his rapier wit. Moving over to Iraq we find the offensive to retake Mosul is being challenged by Erdogan’s threat to send armored columns into Iraq to do a repeat “buffer zone” play as he did in Syria. We may see another defacto Balkanizing of a Mideast country of what has now become a Neo-pirate black flag. All you have to so is claim you are doing it to protect yourself from terrorism and invade any country you want. Iraq’s president Abdi tells of that if Turkey follows up with its threat it will cause the breakup of Turkey, but he did not explain to us how this would happen, as I am sure Turkey would. Erdogan’s Iraq invasion threat buried the big story of thousands of Mosul trained, head chopping, women raping, burying people alive jihadis were going to be moved to Syria to continue working for Western interests there. There was much talk of making sure they could not escape, but we do not hear a one report about one of these escaping units being shot to pieces or captured. Iran’s famous General Qasem Soleimani has even set up a command post west of Mosul to devise an effective strategy of making sure the IS jihadis do not escape. If anybody can do it he can. Lavrov has also weighed in that the Mosul jihadis must be prevented from shifting to a new location. The war zones were not the only scenes where we say crazy things going on. We learned of Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte’s promising to stop swearing because God threatened to take his plane down if he did not. Could the US be giving him some payback by experimenting new brain wave weapons on him for the nasty things he has said to the US? FBI Director Comey went crazy, breaking with tradition of not informing Congressional leaders about investigations, which could be leaked, especially just before an election which could be influenced. He announced an investigation into new Hillary emails on an unsecure computer, against strong Justice Department objections. We already are hearing calls for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate his motives in doing this. Head of Britain’s MI-5, Andrew Parker flips out and jumps into Director Comey’s boat on breaking with tradition by doing a public interview which an incumbent chief has never done in over 100 years. And what was his big concern he wanted to warn us about? He also was wagging the Russian Bear threat about an aggressive, expansionist Russia that was “pushing its foreign policy abroad” by all means. We have all been here before where the public gets the scare mongering treatment to help assure funding for way beyond the needs for real defense. A bogeyman must be dressed up and presented to justify sacrificing domestic spending to feed the military industrial complex. One would hope that Western publics would not be crazy enough to buy into this silliness. Russia is clearly interested only in protecting its most vital interests, which include helping create a multi-polar world to defend the Russian people, and others, from a US hegemony that fewer and fewer trust has benevolent intentions. The Western crazies have been indoctrinating their own people that any country or region that cannot be dominated militarily and economically as a serious threat. The official US defense policy, change under Bill Clinton, now has a clause that justifies a pre-emptive strike on a country that “could become” a threat in the future, even when the US and NATO defense spending and military power far surpass anyone else’s. This of course is a blank check for wanton aggression, but to serve whose interests? Someone is either lying through their teeth to us…or they are crazy…or both. Jim W.

       " ['Russian Researchers Discover Secret Nazi Military Base ‘Treasure Hunter’ in the Arctic [Photos]',\n",
       "  'The mystery surrounding The Third Reich and Nazi Germany is still a subject of debate between many observers. Some believe that Nazi Germany, under the control of Adolf Hitler, possessed supernatural powers, and largely employed pseudo-science during the 1933-1945 period. However, some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact. Over the years, researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi Germany.\\nNazi Germany invaded Russia (formerly the USSR) during the Second World War on June 22, 1941. At the time, the German army progressed deep into Russian territory, gaining ground close to the capital Moscow, before the Russians could counter-attack, eventually driving the Nazis back.\\nDuring the Nazi occupation in Russia, in 1942, the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic, code-named “Schatzgraber” or “Treasure Hunter,” which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia. The base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of Nazi troops, warships and submarines. The base also housed eminent Nazi scientists, whom conducted many experiments to help progress a German win of the war. It was widely speculated at the time that the Nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings. The controversial Ahnenerbe was even linked to the base. The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany. Responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race, it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences. Founded on July 1, 1935, by Heinrich Himmler, Herman Wirth and Richard Walther Darré, the Ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world.\\nHowever, the Nazis abandoned the base in 1944 – a time when the Russian army began its offensive, pushing the Germans out of the country. According to a war-time story, supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels, and the Nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear, which ultimately, was infected with trichinosis. This caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a German U-boat. Despite Russian authors telling the story of “Treasure Hunter,” some observers consider it a myth, doubting its existence.\\nBut Russian researchers have now announced that “Treasure Hunter” has been discovered, saying the base is on the island of Alexandra Land in the Arctic Circle, located 620 miles from the North Pole.\\nA senior researcher at the Russian Arctic National Park, Evgeny Ermolov said in a statement announcing the discovery : “Before it was only known from written sources, but now we also have real proof.”'],\n",

       "  'Proud Shares \\nThe NRA’s magazine acknowledged that President Obama “really hasn’t had the opportunity to” confiscate firearms, undercutting years of fearmongering about the supposed existence of a “ massive Obama conspiracy ” to dismantle the Second Amendment and take guns away. \\nThe NRA’s admission that a president can’t confiscate guns because “Congress writes the laws, not the president” also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the NRA that link Hillary Clinton to gun confiscation. \\nThe admission was included in a June 9 article for NRA magazine America’s 1st Freedom which took issue with how Obama “rudely” responded to a question from a gun store owner at a recent town hall event. \\nThe article quoted Obama as telling the questioner, “I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I’ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.” \\nResponding to Obama’s statement, the article acknowledged, “Now, [the gun store owner]could have interrupted the president to mention that Obama really hasn’t had the opportunity to do that. Congress writes the laws, not the president”: \\nRhude didn’t sit down after asking his question. Rather, he stood silently as President Obama didn’t even try to answer his question, but instead went off on a defensive tirade: “First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks’ guns is just not true. And I don’t care how many times the NRA says it.” \\nObama then said, “I’m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I’ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.” \\nNow, Rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that Obama really hasn’t had the opportunity to do that. Congress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms — from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama’s attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a “pen and phone” to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent. \\nClaims about gun confiscation and Obama have been the NRA’s bread and butter for the past eight years . More recently, the NRA has suggested that the election of Clinton could lead to gun confiscation for law-abiding Americans. \\nRead in full on Media Matters for America: NRA Admits It: “Obama Really Hasn’t Had The Opportunity To” Confiscate Guns \\n'],\n",

       "  'Interviews US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton stands with President Barack Obama during an election eve rally on November 7, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \\nThe American people have “repudiated the foreign policy” of President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton which was “a complete disgrace” for the United States, according to James Fetzer, an American scholar and political analyst. \\nProfessor Fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with Press TV on Monday, days after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stunned the world by defeating the heavily-favored Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, in the November 8 election. \\nDuring the election campaign, Trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems, including the issue of Daesh terrorism, which he has blamed on the policies of the Obama administration. \\nOn the other hand, Clinton has shown eagerness to confront Russia and continue the interventionist policies US administrations have practiced since 9/11. \\nProfessor Fetzer said that “Clinton was behind the massacre of Libya, the butchery of Benghazi, the transfer of weapons to ‘rebels’ in Syria.” \\nMore than five years after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has become a failed state, with the central government holding no sway over the country, and Africa’s wealthiest nation has become a haven for terrorist organizations. \\nAnd since 2011, the United States and its allies have been sponsoring terrorists wreaking havoc in Syria. \\nProfessor Fetzer stated that Clinton was being advised by Israeli intelligence, telling her \"how to conduct American foreign policy. It was a complete disgrace.” \\n“The American people have repudiated the foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,” the scholar said. \\n“Donald Trump is going to restore a measure of sanity. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East. He is going to restore the reputation of the United States for integrity, and dealing with the international community,” he noted. \\n“He respects Russia as should any president of the United States, where Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fell miserably short,” the analyst pointed out. \\n“I believe we are already seeing signs that the situation for the world community is going to vastly, dramatically improve, that the United States is going to conduct itself in accordance with international law, and restrain from regime change, and hopefully we will no longer be the greatest aggressor nation in the world,” Fetzer said in his concluding remarks.

       "  'Vladimir Putin at the Valdai International Discussion Club : «Shaping the World of Tomorrow» by Vladimir Putin Voltaire Network | Sochi (Russia) | 27 October 2016 français русский Tarja, Heinz, Thabo, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,\\nIt is a great pleasure to see you again. I want to start by thanking all of the participants in the Valdai International Discussion Club, from Russia and abroad, for your constructive part in this work, and I want to thank our distinguished guests for their readiness to take part in this open discussion.\\nOur esteemed moderator just wished me a good departure into retirement, and I wish myself the same when the time comes. This is the right approach and the thing to do. But I am not retired yet and am for now the leader of this big country. As such, it is fitting to show restraint and avoid displays of excessive aggressiveness. I do not think that this is my style in any case.\\nBut I do think that we should be frank with each other, particularly here in this gathering. I think we should hold candid, open discussions, otherwise our dialogue makes no sense and would be insipid and without the slightest interest.\\nI think that this style of discussion is extremely needed today given the great changes taking place in the world. The theme for our meeting this year, The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow, is very topical.\\nLast year, the Valdai forum participants discussed the problems with the current world order. Unfortunately, little has changed for the better over these last months. Indeed, it would be more honest to say that nothing has changed.\\nThe tensions engendered by shifts in distribution of economic and political influence continue to grow. Mutual distrust creates a burden that narrows our possibilities for finding effective responses to the real threats and challenges facing the world today. Essentially, the entire globalisation project is in crisis today and in Europe, as we know well, we hear voices now saying that multiculturalism has failed.\\nI think this situation is in many respects the result of mistaken, hasty and to some extent over-confident choices made by some countries’ elites a quarter-of-a-century ago. Back then, in the late 1980s-early 1990s, there was a chance not just to accelerate the globalisation process but also to give it a different quality and make it more harmonious and sustainable in nature.\\nBut some countries that saw themselves as victors in the Cold War, not just saw themselves this way but said it openly, took the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.\\nIn their euphoria, they essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalisation and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this.\\nWe may as well be frank here, as we know full well that many did not agree with what was happening, but some were unable by then to respond, and others were not yet ready to respond. The result though is that the system of international relations is in a feverish state and the global economy cannot extricate itself from systemic crisis. At the same time, rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely.\\nIf the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules.\\nThus, we saw the decisions to launch airstrikes in the centre of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya. The operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favour these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defence systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos.\\nWe see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organisation and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organisation itself aside and build a new one instead. This illustrates what I just said.\\nAt the same time, some of our partners demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today. In organisations such as NATO, for example, established during the Cold War and clearly out of date today, despite all the talk about the need to adapt to the new reality, no real adaptation takes place. We see constant attempts to turn the OSCE, a crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security, into an instrument in the service of someone’s foreign policy interests. The result is that this very important organisation has been hollowed out.\\nBut they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‘Russian military threat’. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defence budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower’s interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders.\\nOf course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilisation against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. I also read analytical materials, those written by you here today, and by your colleagues in the USA and Europe.\\nIt is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. Europe alone has 300 million people. All of the NATO members together with the USA have a total population of 600 million, probably. But Russia has only 146 million. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims.\\nAnother mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.\\nYou would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.\\nI have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people’s choice? America is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.\\nThe question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world?\\nSad as it is to say, there is no consensus on these issues in the world today. Maybe you have come to some common conclusions through your discussions, and I would, of course, be interested to hear them. But it is very clear that there is a lack of strategy and ideas for the future. This creates a climate of uncertainty that has a direct impact on the public mood.\\nSociological studies conducted around the world show that people in different countries and on different continents tend to see the future as murky and bleak. This is sad. The future does not entice them, but frightens them. At the same time, people see no real opportunities or means for changing anything, influencing events and shaping policy.\\nYes, formally speaking, modern countries have all the attributes of democracy: Elections, freedom of speech, access to information, freedom of expression. But even in the most advanced democracies the majority of citizens have no real influence on the political process and no direct and real influence on power.\\nPeople sense an ever-growing gap between their interests and the elite’s vision of the only correct course, a course the elite itself chooses. The result is that referendums and elections increasingly often create surprises for the authorities. People do not at all vote as the official and respectable media outlets advised them to, nor as the mainstream parties advised them to. Public movements that only recently were too far left or too far right are taking centre stage and pushing the political heavyweights aside.\\nAt first, these inconvenient results were hastily declared anomaly or chance. But when they became more frequent, people started saying that society does not understand those at the summit of power and has not yet matured sufficiently to be able to assess the authorities’ labour for the public good. Or they sink into hysteria and declare it the result of foreign, usually Russian, propaganda.\\nFriends and colleagues, I would like to have such a propaganda machine here in Russia, but regrettably, this is not the case. We have not even global mass media outlets of the likes of CNN, BBC and others. We simply do not have this kind of capability yet.\\nAs for the claim that the fringe and populists have defeated the sensible, sober and responsible minority – we are not talking about populists or anything like that but about ordinary people, ordinary citizens who are losing trust in the ruling class. That is the problem.\\nBy the way, with the political agenda already eviscerated as it is, and with elections ceasing to be an instrument for change but consisting instead of nothing but scandals and digging up dirt – who gave someone a pinch, who sleeps with whom, if you’ll excuse me. This just goes beyond all boundaries. And honestly, a look at various candidates’ platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould – the difference is slight, if there is any.\\nIt seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favour of the suzerain.\\nThis begs the question: who is actually the fringe? The expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things – stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones.\\nPeople are clearly scared to see how terrorism is evolving from a distant threat to an everyday one, how a terrorist attack could occur right near them, on the next street, if not on their own street, while any makeshift item – from a home-made explosive to an ordinary truck – can be used to carry out a mass killing.\\nMoreover, the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the past few years in Boston and other US cities, Paris, Brussels, Nice and German cities, as well as, sadly, in our own country, show that terrorists do not need units or organised structures – they can act independently, on their own, they just need the ideological motivation against their enemies, that is, against you and us.\\nThe terrorist threat is a clear example of how people fail to adequately evaluate the nature and causes of the growing threats. We see this in the way events in Syria are developing. No one has succeeded in stopping the bloodshed and launching a political settlement process. One would think that we would have begun to put together a common front against terrorism now, after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort and difficult compromises.\\nBut this has not happened and this common front has not emerged. My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results either. There were people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice. This all demonstrates an unexplainable and I would say irrational desire on the part of the Western countries to keep making the same mistakes or, as we say here in Russia, keep stepping on the same rake.\\nWe all see what is happening in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and a number of other countries. I have to ask, where are the results of the fight against terrorism and extremism? Overall, looking at the world as a whole, there are some results in particular regions and locations, but there is no global result and the terrorist threat continues to grow.\\nWe all remember the euphoria in some capitals over the Arab Spring. Where are these fanfares today? Russia’s calls for a joint fight against terrorism go ignored. What’s more, they continue to arm, supply and train terrorist groups in the hope of using them to achieve their own political aims. This is a very dangerous game and I address the players once again: The extremists in this case are more cunning, clever and stronger than you, and if you play these games with them, you will always lose.\\nColleagues, it is clear that the international community should concentrate on the real problems facing humanity today, the resolution of which will make our world a safer and more stable place and make the system of international relations fairer and more equal. As I said, it is essential to transform globalisation from something for a select few into something for all. It is my firm belief that we can overcome these threats and challenges only by working together on the solid foundation of international law and the United Nations Charter.\\nToday it is the United Nations that continues to remain an agency that is unparalleled in representativeness and universality, a unique venue for equitable dialogue. Its universal rules are necessary for including as many countries as possible in economic and humanitarian integration, guaranteeing their political responsibility and working to coordinate their actions while also preserving their sovereignty and development models.\\nWe have no doubt that sovereignty is the central notion of the entire system of international relations. Respect for it and its consolidation will help underwrite peace and stability both at the national and international levels. There are many countries that can rely on a history stretching back a thousand years, like Russia, and we have come to appreciate our identity, freedom and independence. But we do not seek global domination, expansion or confrontation with anyone.\\nIn our mind, real leadership lies in seeing real problems rather than attempting to invent mythical threats and use them to steamroll others. This is exactly how Russia understands its role in global affairs today.\\nThere are priorities without which a prosperous future for our shared planet is unthinkable and they are absolutely obvious. I won’t be saying anything new here. First of all, there is equal and indivisible security for all states. Only after ending armed conflicts and ensuring the peaceful development of all countries will we be able to talk about economic progress and the resolution of social, humanitarian and other key problems. It is important to fight terrorism and extremism in actuality. It has been said more than once that this evil can only be overcome by a concerted effort of all states of the world. Russia continues to offer this to all interested partners.\\nIt is necessary to add to the international agenda the issue of restoring the Middle Eastern countries’ lasting statehood, economy and social sphere. The mammoth scale of destruction demands drawing up a long-term comprehensive programme, a kind of Marshall Plan, to revive the war- and conflict-ridden area. Russia is certainly willing to join actively in these team efforts.\\nWe cannot achieve global stability unless we guarantee global economic progress. It is essential to provide conditions for creative labour and economic growth at a pace that would put an end to the division of the world into permanent winners and permanent losers. The rules of the game should give the developing economies at least a chance to catch up with those we know as developed economies. We should work to level out the pace of economic development, and brace up backward countries and regions so as to make the fruit of economic growth and technological progress accessible to all. Particularly, this would help to put an end to poverty, one of the worst contemporary problems.\\nIt is also absolutely evident that economic cooperation should be mutually lucrative and rest on universal principles to enable every country to become an equal partner in global economic activities. True, the regionalising trend in the world economy is likely to persist in the medium term. However, regional trade agreements should complement and expand not replace the universal norms and regulations.\\nRussia advocates the harmonisation of regional economic formats based on the principles of transparency and respect for each other’s interests. That is how we arrange the work of the Eurasian Economic Union and conduct negotiations with our partners, particularly on coordination with the Silk Road Economic Belt project, which China is implementing. We expect it to promote an extensive Eurasian partnership, which promises to evolve into one of the formative centres of a vast Eurasian integration area. To implement this idea, 5+1 talks have begun already for an agreement on trade and economic cooperation between all participants in the process.\\nAn important task of ours is to develop human potential. Only a world with ample opportunities for all, with highly skilled workers, access to knowledge and a great variety of ways to realise their potential can be considered truly free. Only a world where people from different countries do not struggle to survive but lead full lives can be stable.\\nA decent future is impossible without environment protection and addressing climate problems. That is why the conservation of the natural world and its diversity and reducing the human impact on the environment will be a priority for the coming decades.\\nAnother priority is global healthcare. Of course, there are many problems, such as large-scale epidemics, decreasing the mortality rate in some regions and the like. So there is enormous room for advancement. All people in the world, not only the elite, should have the right to healthy, long and full lives. This is a noble goal. In short, we should build the foundation for the future world today by investing in all priority areas of human development. And of course, it is necessary to continue a broad-based discussion of our common future so that all sensible and promising initiatives are heard.\\nColleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that you, as members of the Valdai Club, will actively take part in this work. Your expertise enables you to understand all angles of the processes underway both in Russia and in the world, forecast and evaluate long-term trends, and put forward new initiatives and recommendations that will help us find the way to the more prosperous and sustainable future that we all badly need.\\nThank you very much for your attention.\\nVladimir Putin'],\n",

       "  'STORE Trump’s blueprint may soon cross the pond to effect Europe’s elections \\nPerhaps one of the biggest ironies in this year’s historic election was how often the media and the pundits tried to both tell and get Donald Trump to ‘act’ more presidential. And at the heart of this irony was the fact that Trump’s demeanor was no different than some of the greatest Presidents in America’s history when you study the likes of Andrew Jackson and Teddy Roosevelt. \\nIn the end however, Donald Trump’s personality was a perfect mixture of determination coupled with a dash of bombastic that helped create a whirlwind which energized a nation into pulling off the greatest upset in political history. \\nIn times of political and societal change it is charisma, far more than ability, that most often wins the race. And in a year where the world was shocked by the Brexit vote in the UK, and the Chicago Cubs coming back from a 3-1 deficit to win the world series, those who can tap into the ethereal energy of that change will accomplish the impossible no matter what people think or believe. \\nAnd going forward the ongoing frequency shift that has is occurring right now, just as it has occurred in a cyclical fashion throughout history, still has a long way to playing itself out. And with that in mind the next potential nexus point of extreme change is emerging in the scheduled referendums and elections over in Europe that will take place over the next six months. \\nDaniela Schwarzer, director of research at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), said Trump’s bare-fisted tactics against his opponents and the media provided a model for populist European parties that have exercised comparative restraint on a continent that still remembers World War Two. “The broken taboos, the extent of political conflict, the aggression that we’ve seen from Trump, this can widen the scope of what becomes thinkable in our own political culture, ” Schwarzer said. \\nPerhaps it is not the “political conflict” or aggression from Trump that Daniela is worried about; perhaps it is the threat of a truly democratic vote in a world in which all the benefits of crony capitalism and suppressed representation have gone exclusively to the 1%, something which is now openly known and resented by the rest of the increasingly angry population. And, as both Brexit and Trump have shown, an angry, education population is the worst possible enemy of any elitist, globalist clique. \\nItaly and Austria \\nEurope will get the first taste of its own “Trump Moment” as early as next month, when on December 4 Austrians will vote in a presidential election that could see Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party become the first far-right head of state to be freely elected in western Europe since 1945. On the same day, a constitutional reform referendum on which Prime Minister Renzi has staked his future could upset the political order in Italy, pushing Grillo’s left-wing 5-Star movement closer to the reins of power. \\nChanneling Donald Trump, local Euroskeptic politician and comedian, Beppe Grillo said that “an epoch has gone up in flames . The real demagogues are the press, intellectuals, who are anchored to a world that no longer exists.” – Zerohedge \\nPolitics today is most often ruled by tradition and expectations, with things like lies, obfuscation, and corruption being accepted parts of the process. But as Donald Trump proved in the last two years leading up to the results of Nov. 8, the right person or movement can not only supersede establishment machines, but in very real ways it can also destroy them. \\nSix months ago no one would have imagined that Britain would have voted to leave the European Union, especially after nations such as Greece willingly stayed in the coalition despite the treatment they were given by member states and banking interests. But we are no longer in a frequency of normal, and before this paradigm shift is finally completed impossible phenomenons like Trump winning the Presidency will be just one of many changes that will alter the entire landscape of Europe, America, and the world. \\nKenneth Schortgen Jr is a writer for The Daily Economist , Secretsofthefed.com , Roguemoney.net , and Viral Liberty , and hosts the popular youtube podcast on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

       " ['Normal Saline vs. Lactated Ringer’s: Results of a Phase 3 Randomized Quadruple-Blind Clinical Water Balloon Fight | GomerBlog',\n",
       "  'Tweet \\nBACKGROUND: The superiority of Lactated Ringer’s solution (LR) or normal saline (NS) in fluid resuscitation in a variety of medical and surgical scenarios remains the most hotly debated irrelevant topic in modern medicine. For this reason and because advancement in our academic medicine careers requires us to have a certain number of publications, we have designed this study to finally determine which of the two is the ULTIMATE FLUID! \\nMETHODS: The medical and surgical departments at Miskatonic Medical Center in Maine were made to compete in a no-holds-barred water balloon battle. The teams were randomized to either NS or LR-filled water balloons. Participants were blinded as to which fluid they were using and the data analysis teams were blinded as well. Finally, everyone involved was physically blindfolded by two different blindfolds, thus creating the first ever QUADRUPLE -BLIND clinical study. \\nNephrologists were excluded from participating, because they can unfailingly identify and manipulate all fluids with their psychic powers. \\nRESULTS: The surgical department pulled into an early lead thanks in no small part to the orthopedics team. Led by Dr. Brock Hammersley and assisted by a platoon of Stryker reps who refilled water balloons and acted as spotters, the ortho team’s throws were powerful enough to send the medical department’s participants to the ER with broken bones . \\nDr. Hammersley almost won the day for the surgical department by turfing all the new admissions straight back to medicine. However, in a surprise twist, the medicine department pulled out their ace in the hole: legendary hospitalist and goalkeeper Tim Howard . Howard, who has managed to keep his hospitalist team admission-free for two straight years, was able to easily deflect every admission. \\nDespite Dr. Howard’s assistance, the surgical team captured more flags, scored more touchdowns, shot more hoops, and generally looked cooler doing it all. Nevertheless, medicine ultimately won on points after the medical student on the Heme/Onc service managed to quote the JNC 9 Water Balloon Battle guidelines as pertaining to left-handed African-American male patients with preeclampsia on a night when five virgins are sacrificed to the blood moon. \\nCONCLUSION: Lactated Ringer’s solution (ironically randomized to medicine) is the ULTIMATE FLUID! Further work needs to be done so we can continue getting NIH funding. 2K Shares '],\n",

       "  \"\\nIn November 2014, a horrific gang rape allegedly took place at a New Jersey college. \\nThe supposed victim: a 19-year-old woman who claims she was lured into a fraternity “date party” by members of Pi Kappa Alpha (PIKE). \\nShe's continuing to fight for justice after what allegedly happened to her two years ago, by filing a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court last week against Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey. Ex-student sues NJ college over alleged 'brutal' gang rape at frat house, dorm https://t.co/84VQ1uKHZY — New Jersey 101.5 (@nj1015) October 25, 2016 \\nAccording to northjersey.com , the victim was greeted at her dorm door by a fraternity member in a tuxedo, who was reportedly “assigned” to get girls to come to the party. \\nOnce the victim was there, court documents reveal she became drunk to the point of unconsciousness and woke up after attending the party, felt she had been sexually assaulted, and went to Hackensack University Medical Center. Officials there found lacerations “consistent with non-consensual sex.” \\nThe teen, who goes by “Jane Doe” in the lawsuit, claims she was gang raped by tuxedo-wearing Christopher A. Lopez and another student, Nakeem Gardner, who are now 26 and 22 years old. \\nThe New York Daily News reports Lopez and Gardner even played the game “rock, paper, scissors” to decide who would have sex with the female student first. \\nAnd the abuse allegedly didn't end there. NJ.com reports: \\nAfter the initial sexual assault, the teen was involuntarily moved “without her shoes, underwear and jacket” across campus to Mackin Hall, where she was raped by others, the lawsuit claims. \\nThe suit alleges some of the male students “were falling-down laughing hysterically while also videotaping the sexual assault” on a cell phone. \\nThree other students — Christopher Rainone, 20, Jordyn Massood, 20, and Justin Sommers, 20 — were also charged in connection to the alleged assault. \\nLopez and Gardner were charged with second degree sexual assault for allegedly gang raping the victim. Rainone, Massod and Sommers were charged with failing to aid the victim and for videotaping her while she was naked. \\nAll five former students have been indicted in connection with the alleged attacks, but pleaded not guilty in July 2016, and were offered a plea deal as a result. Image Credit: Bergen County Prosecutor's Office \\nThe lawsuit holds Ramapo College and/or PIKE Fraternity and Chapter accountable for what allegedly happened. \\nHere are just a few of the suits ' claims: \\n“College and PIKE Fraternity representatives were aware of the events leading up to the assaults, but did nothing to intervene or stop them from unfolding.” \\n“This includes public safety and security employees and representatives, including outside Campus Security staff on patrol and present in security booths and checkpoints, well as the individual responsible for entry and exit at Mackin Hall.” \\n“The school failed to enforce their own alcohol policies and failed to deter underage drinking on campus.” \\n“Ramapo College was negligent, had deliberate indifference and failed to render assistance to a victim and intentional infliction of emotional distress.” \\nThe lawsuit goes on to argue that the victim has suffered permanent physical, psychological and emotional injuries as a result. \\nIncidentally, this same college made headlines in 2014, when a school-led session on “understanding sexual assault” included advice that females should be aware of how their facial expressions could be misinterpreted by members of the opposite sex. \\nVice president at Ramapo, Cathy Davey, told northjersey.com the college hadn't yet been served with the lawsuit as of Tuesday, and that PIKE Fraternity was “no longer on campus.” \"],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nsott.net/news \\n© Murad Sezer / Reuters An armored police vehicle drives past by the headquarters of Cumhuriyet newspaper, an opposition secularist daily, in Istanbul, Turkey, October 31, 2016. \\nTurkish PM Binali Yildirim has responded to concerns expressed by Ankara’s EU partners over the situation with the freedom of expression in the country, saying that European standards apparently have no importance for Turkey. \\nFollowing Monday’s arrests of the editor-in-chief and other top staff of Turkey’s opposition Cumhuriyet daily, European Parliament President Martin Schulz harshly criticized Ankara’s actions, having called it a part of a “purge… motivated by political considerations, rather than legal and security rationale.” \\nTurkey has once again crossed the “red line” against freedom of expression, the politician wrote on Twitter. \\n“Brother, we don’t care about your red line. It’s the people who draw the red line. What importance does your line have. We draw another red line on top of yours,” Yildirim told members of his ruling AK Party in a parliament speech. \\nImplying that its only the people of Turkey who can hold the government “accountable” for its actions, Yildirim said Ankara would not be intimidated by EU’s “threats”. \\nCrowds gathered by the Cumhuriyet offices during the night, to express their support for the media, Reuters reported. According to Turkey’s journalists’ association, 170 media outlets have been shut down following the attempted coup. \\n“We are not going to learn from you what press freedom is. We support it all the way,” Reuters quoted Yildirim as saying. \\nThe new wave of arrests and investigations of the Cumhuriyet staff come under accusations that the media – which has been critical of President Tayyip Erdogan, had assisted a failed military coup in July. Alleging that the journalists played their part in the coup by publishing “subliminal messages” in their columns, according to Turkish Anadolu agency, prosecutors accused them of supporting Kurdish militants and US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. The latter is blamed by the government for orchestrating the coup. \\n“[Our European friends] always bring up press freedom when we take steps in our fight against terrorism,” the prime minister said, adding that Turkey has “no problem with press freedom.” \\n[embedded content] '],\n",

       " [\"Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans\",\n",
       "  '22 Shares\\n8 13 0 1\\nAs Donald Trump gains more bad press, Hilary Clinton rides the political wave with quick responses, deflections and denials. Without question, and largely due to Trump\\'s obnoxious candor and grandiose proclamations, she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious Glenn Beck. She is, without question, a wolf in sheep\\'s clothing. While Trump is unbelievably hard to take, constantly, we need to focus on one simple question, which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first?\\nI suspect it would be Hillary Clinton who would be most inclined toward involving Americans in another military conflict, and she doesn\\'t go small, as she constantly demonizes Russia with threats of military action. In Clinton\\'s own words, \"You\\'ve seen reports, Russia has hacked into a lot of things, China has hacked into a lot of things, Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee, maybe even some state election systems. So we\\'ve got to step up our game, make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us. As President, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.\"\\nMilitary responses to a nation the US stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades? Military response against Russia? Over suspected hacking? Hillary Clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with Donald Trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences.\\nIt all stems from the Wikileaks release that included 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from leaders at the Democratic National Committee. Clinton says the Russians did it, the national mainstream media parroted those words. It\\'s the American media\\'s political conditioning system at its finest, convincingly reaching tens of millions of Americans, and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the Russians. In a USA Today article from July 2016, Elizabith Weise wrote, \"Computer security researchers say it’s difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the Democratic National Committee subsequently posted online by Wikileaks was the work of Russian hackers, as some media outlets have reported.\"\\nRussia\\'s leader, Vladmir Putin, says the US long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction, well before the Cold War even ended. Peace with Russia should be a top priority for any US Presidential candidate. The truth is that American politicians, perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves, created a road block on the highway to peace during the Vietnam War. Putin said during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2016, \"It is not in my nature to scold someone -- but when the United States unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty (in) 1972 they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security. That was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world\".\\nMORE... 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Voting for the “Lesser Evil” Now we have Clinton warmongering over unfounded allegations.\\nWorld Rivals in the Air\\nThere is a decades-old history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology. While American designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better, the fastest jet fighter ever made is the Russian MiG-25; it can break Mach III, more than three times the speed of sound. Such demands lessen the life of an aircraft. The MiG-25 is typically not flown at anything close to that speed. As an interceptor however, it was supreme, no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it.\\nThe Korean War was the first test. Soviet MiG-15\\'s initially dominated the skies. With Russian and Chinese pilots often at the controls, the MiG\\'s were deadly.\\nOn 1 November 1950, at least sixteen American F-51 fighters (P-51 Mustangs) were shot at by six Soviet MiG-15 interceptors led by Soviet WWII ace Mayor Nikolay V. Stroykov. The WWII \"prop\" planes like the Mustang, along with the U.S. F-80 Shooting Star and F-84 Thunderjet jet fighters, had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable MiG fighters.\\nEverything changed when the U.S. Air Force launched the F-86 Sabre. Wikipedia explains that the F-86 Sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest. Foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six .50 caliber machine guns, which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target. F-86 pilots were also equipped with G-suits, which prevented pilot blackout in high-speed turning maneuvers.\\nIt is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and \"kill\" ratios over \"MiG Alley\" during the Korean War.\\nThe Soviets claimed 1,106 United Nations planes of all types shot down, including about 650 Sabres. (The USAF only admits to losing less than 200 aircraft in air combat.)\\nThe F-86 pilots claimed 792 MiG-15s shot down, while B-29 gunners claimed a further 16. These numbers were later reduced to 379 MiGs. The Chinese air force claimed only 85 kills.\\nIn Vietnam, the competitors varied. The MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters were widely used by the North Vietnamese Air Force. They fought planes like the F-100 Super Sabre, F-5 Tiger and the F-4 Phantom. Once again, if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part, the U.S. planes dominated in most air to air combat, though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the Americans. During the end of the Cold War in the 1980\\'s, the Soviet MiG-29 was the terror of the skies. There was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first. While MiG aircraft were only built in odd numbers, the movie Top Gun references the aircraft by calling them MiG-28\\'s - \"MiG-28\\'s, no one\\'s been this close before!\" The planes used in the movie were actually American F-5 Tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails. Today the United States spends obscene amounts on planes like the F-22 Raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern Russian planes like the SU-30. Both in this case, are capable of \"thrust vectoring\" which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight. The ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the AV8/b Harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter. Hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war, but with Clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the US used to hold over the Russian military have evaporated into thin air.\\nRussia\\'s Modern Approach to Warfare\\nDuring the decades-long Cold War, the Soviet Union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander, or a pilot, from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order. Kemp Freund, a US Army sergeant major that I met while I was covering the war in Afghanistan, was Quote: d in my 2007 video report \"Camp Joyce: Remote Fire Base Near Afghanistan-Pakistan Border\" saying, \"We\\'re trying to break the old Soviet methods that they use and the Soviet method had that Lt. Col. completely in the dark until he needed to move.” He added, “We\\'re still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill.\" The Soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now. Today\\'s Russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than US taxpayer funded military planes, they also utilize tactics of Western pilots. Hillary Clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another \"war president\" which was so important to former President George W. Bush, and Obama too for that matter.\\nOther Looming Conflicts\\nLest we forget, Hillary Clinton\\'s unwavering support of Israel, the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by US taxpayer money and military hardware. The government of right wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to violate the human rights of Palestinians constantly, while building settlements which are completely illegal under international law. Then there are the attacks in Gaza that target schools and hospitals, leaving hundreds and hundreds dead and thousands severely injured. Never does Clinton speak out against the barbaric treatment Israel reserves for non-Jews, never does she refer to the fact that the country we now call Iran hasn\\'t attacked a nation outside of its borders for more than three hundred years. Yet Iran has been savagely attacked by the United States both directly and indirectly. Maintaining her warmongering spirit, Clinton said, \"I want the Iranians to know that if I\\'m president we will attack Iran.\" She added that, \"We would be able to totally obliterate them.\"'],\n",
       " ['Yemen’s Seventh Truce: Turning Tragedy Into Farce | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Yemen With six previous attempts to observe truce having already failed to mitigate the intensity of the crisis, the US brokered seventh truce has yet again —and unsurprisingly— failed to end the fighting in Yemen where the death toll has already risen to 7,000. Despite the fact that both rebels and the Yemeni government had agreed to observe the truce and the ceasefire announced by the Saudia led coalition, fighting has surged, with both sides accusing each other of violation, around the flashpoint southwestern city of Taez, where violence has killed dozens this week, despite clashes subsiding on several fronts. While the fighting itself is a clear reflection of the US’ inability to control the situation on the ground even in a limited sense, the irony of the matter is that—and what turns the tragedy into farce—the US, which is trying to broker peace, happens to be the biggest provider of weapons to Saudi Arabia which has been bombing Yemen for last 19 months. This is where the crux of the problem lies and this is where the original cause of the war must be traced back to. Yemen war continues to drag on not because the warring parties are unable to come to terms; it continues to defy a negotiated end due primarily to the US’ dual-game in the region—a policy that utilises the war-scenario to not only to deepen the Arab countries’ dependence upon the US for military assistance and aid but also to earn billions in terms of weapons sold to the same countries. Therefore, John Kerry’s involvement in many rounds of talks notwithstanding, it is also a fact that many strikes are actually carried out by Saudi pilots who have received their training by the US and who fly US-made jets that are refuelled in the air by American planes. And Yemenis often find the remains of American-made munitions, as they did in the ruins after a strike that killed more than 100 mourners at a funeral last month. Graffiti on walls across Sana reads: “America is killing the Yemeni people.” To the US’ disappointment, no graffiti reads “America is brokering peace in Yemen”, or that “America, is protecting the Yemenis from brutal bombing.” With the US thus playing a double game in Yemen and with the US-made missiles and jets pounding the Yemenis indiscriminately, the question of the US being a committer of war crimes becomes pertinent. The allegation has concrete material base. For instance, consider this: while the UN officials were expressing their concerns over the rising toll of civilian deaths in Yemen in September this year, the US Senate backed, on September 21, the Obama administration’s plan to sell more than $1 billion worth of American-made tanks and other weapons to Saudi Arabia, soundly defeating a bid to derail the deal pushed by lawmakers critical of the kingdom’s role in Yemen’s war. The deal involves more than 100 main battle tanks, machine guns, smoke grenade launchers, night-vision devices, vehicles to recover damaged tanks from the battlefield, and thousands of rounds of training ammunition. The primary contractor for the equipment is General Dynamics Land Systems of Sterling Heights, Michigan. With Saudi Arabia being such an important buyer of the US made weapons, which are being currently used in Yemen against the Houthis, and with the US being eager to fulfil its security commitments and equally facilitating the Saudi led coalitions’ bombing campaigns both logistically and militarily, peace cannot really be established, not unless the US forces Saudia to stop its bombing campaign—something that comes at a high-cost for the US weapon-makers: hence, unlikely to happen. What adds insult to injury is that the supporters of the deal say that the US cannot deny its Middle East allies the weapons they need to combat Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) extremists and check Iran’s aggression in the region. “Blocking this sale of tanks will be interpreted by our Gulf partners, not just Saudi Arabia, as another sign that the United States of America is abandoning our commitment to the region and is an unreliable security partner,” said John McCain. The support continues despite the fact that the Saudi-led coalition was responsible for 60 percent of the 2,067 civilians killed in the conflict over a yearlong span starting on July 1, 2015, according to a report released by U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein. Given the dual game the US is playing in Yemen, it cannot be gainsaid that truce and ceasefire cannot hold the fighting and pave the way for an end of the war, not unless Saudi Arabia’s source of military power, the US, decides to cut off the chain of supply and brings it to the negotiating table—something that is unlikely to happen under Obama administration and something that would be paid lip service only under the Trump administration. In this context, the off and on saga of truce and ceasefire means nothing except that it allows the US administration to feed the general public with the impression of maintaining a ‘neutral’ stance towards the war.

       " ['BREAKING: Melania Trump’s Immigration Records Made Public, Show Trump’s ULTIMATE Hypocrisy | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave',\n",
       "  'on November 4, 2016 10:58 pm · \\nGOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline – and even bigoted – stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect “deportation forces” to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. \\nAccording to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trump’s wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor’s visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. \\nSo, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: \\n“As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American.” \\nWell, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn’t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management – a modeling agency. Also, there’s the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor’s visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania’s wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . \\nThe long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the “other.” Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn’t completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time. \\nFeatured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!

       " ['Tim Kaine: “Hillary Will Modify Obamacare To Include Gun-Addiction Therapy”',\n",
       "  'Elections 2016 \\nVice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine is taking aim at the NRA, saying he’s done what he can about “common sense” gun laws in his home state of Virginia, but has watched Congress falter in the face of the gun lobby. “We have to make a decision about what matters to us,” said Kaine in an opinion piece published by Time magazine Tuesday. “We have to treat this like the public health crisis it is.” Kaine notes that he is a gun owner and that he supports the Second Amendment. \\n“It needs to be said that sugarcoating this sort of thing isn’t going to make it better,” Kaine also argued during his subsequent interview. “Neither Hillary Clinton nor I can stand Donald Trump, that’s common knowledge, but there is one thing about his ridiculous rhetoric I have to agree with, and that’s that political correctness in this country has long ceased to be useful. Today’s approach revolves around directness and no-beating-around-the-bush kind of mentality when it comes to communication.” \\nHe continued, “That’s precisely the reason why we need to tackle the gun safety issue head on and without pardon. It’s a burning problem that is affecting millions of Americans every single day, and as such, it represents an emergency. At the end of the day, public health is not something that should be neglected for the obvious reasons, and whether we’d like to admit it or not, the public health of America today is becoming increasingly gangrenous.” \\n“Guns have found their way to every single layer of society and have become the preferred method of resolving disputes and mere disagreements,” Kaine said. “We must put a stop to that and I’m happy to announce that Hillary Clinton has come up with the perfect solution for this problem. She is going to modify Obamacare from its existing state into a comprehensive healthcare program that’s going to include both voluntary, but also mandatory gun-addiction therapy.” \\nHe also said, “That way, Republicans who just want to talk and have their side of the story heard will be listened to instead of ignored and left to their own inner demons, which tend to come up to the surface via a weapon of some sort. On the other hand, Republicans who own more than one firearm and/or shoot it regularly either at a firing range or somewhere else will be summoned to a mandatory conversation with a licensed gun-addiction psychotherapist who will make sure to explain to them that it’s perfectly okay to be a liberal and own a gun. The two aren’t mutually exclusive.” \\n“And the best part? They won’t have to pay a cent for it – it will all be covered by the federal budget. So, even if you happen to be a recurring Republican and gun owner, don’t worry, we can fix you. The Hillary Clinton administration will make sure to give back to its citizens just as much as it takes from them. And when you take a Republican’s gun, you’re basically de-Americanizing him. We are going to change that. Obamacare will become a symbol for fewer weapons in the country, which could ultimately result in a Nobel peace prize for Hillary Clinton. Only this time, naturally, it won’t be just a fictional recognition. Unlike Obama, President Clinton will actually be given a plaque,” Kaine concluded.

I\\'ve lived through successive Democratic Party administrations with little to celebrate. The Bill Clinton era brought NAFTA, which outsourced my Aunt\\'s union job and forced her into the low-wage service sector. My mother never found a living wage job and relied on my father\\'s public sector union position to meet our family\\'s needs. In the 21st century, Obama expanded Bush’s War on Terror, which merged my father’s job with into the Department of Homeland Security.\\nDownward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and I. Even then, my sister and I graduated with large sums of student debt. I have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage. Another four years of a Democratic Party President was not going to make anything better for my family. That is not to say that Donald Trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation. But Trump\\'s victory is not the end of the world, either.\\nTrump\\'s victory is the product of global capitalism’s decay. Millions of people voted for Trump for a variety of reasons, namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them. I don’t agree with all of his solutions. White nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda. Trump’s call to further militarize the US-Mexico border yet make peace with Russia is a contradiction in and of itself. A white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency.\\nHowever, Trump’s consistency is not the most important aspect of this election. Millions of people have shown their disgust with the two-party system of the capitalist class. A number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for Trump. Trump also received more votes than expected from the Black and Latino electorate. Meanwhile, the elections produced a low turnout for Clinton from the historic Democratic Party bases of Black voters, Latino voters, and women voters. Clinton may have won the electoral vote, but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on Trump. Trump\\'s base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of Democratic party voters who are now without a home. The round table of elites called the Electoral College could not afford any more damage to the Democratic Party than what transpired during the election.\\nSo the Democratic Party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it: white liberals. A large section of the Democratic Party base wanted Bernie Sanders to be their next President. They did not hold their nose for Clinton. The legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with Trump\\'s racism should not be led into the bowels of the Democratic Party. Yet for white liberals, this is the ultimate mission.\\nMORE...

White liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over Clinton\\'s loss. They then placed blame for Trump’s victory on Russia, low-voter turnout, and the white working class. White liberals have blamed everyone except Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Now, white liberals in the US hope to wage a crusade against Trump in hopes of a Democratic Party recovery. It is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both Trump and Clinton and lead them into the Democratic Party graveyard.\\nWhite liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal. They speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other. They talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests. White liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from.\\nWhite liberals usually originate from the ruling class, the managerial class, and various stripes of the professionalized sector. Their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of \"human rights\" based on race, gender, and sexual equality. However, White liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation. In other words, the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in US society. It has wielded the so-called struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of class-consciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders.\\nThe 2016 elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame. White liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the Trump moment. Their dominance over the left in the US ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline. Millions of people voted for Sanders based on his demands for material relief. Millions of people voted for Trump for the similar reasons, his racism and sexism notwithstanding. Whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not \"trump\" the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him. If the Trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily, they would of voted for Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush in the primaries.\\nSo White liberal anger about Trump\\'s victory is not directed at sexism, racism, or any other aspect of Trump\\'s politics. White liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of US society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order. Millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years? Where were the White liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by Democratic Party Administrations? Where were the White liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world, the institutions that murder and incarcerate Black Americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates?\\nThe answer is that white liberals were supporting the US capitalist system\\'s assault on the oppressed every step of the way. This is what they are trying to hide with their anger over Trump. We cannot defeat Trump\\'s white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor. White liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements. As it spreads, it breeds the germs of Democratic Party control over these movements. But the Democratic Party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class. If a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of Trump, then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the Democratic Party and build an independent party of our own.'],\n",
       " ['5 Treadmill Tips to Burn More Calories and 5 Common Mistakes to Avoid',\n",
       "  'Prev post Page 1 of 3 Next \\nIt’s time for a workout, and you want to get the most out of it. This should always be the case (otherwise, why bother?), but many people get so accustomed to routines that they can be doing more harm than good. Variety is one of the keys to any workout, and running is no different. \\nYou may think of the treadmill as tedious and tiring, but there are ways that it can be just as much fun as the most exciting marathon or run on the beach. Most people look at the time they spend on the treadmill as a boring necessity that they have to put their heads down and power through, but it can be exciting and fun if done the right way. This is especially the case when you know that you are getting the absolute most out of your treadmill time. \\nMany of us would prefer to do our running outside, but the old hamster wheel can have added advantages and benefits when you know what you’re doing. By the same token, it can be self-defeating if you hit a rut or make many common mistakes. \\nThat’s why we put together this list. There are a few easy steps you can take (no pun intended) to turn that boring old task into an exciting, calorie burning blast, and we want to help you do that. We also want to help you avoid many of the common– and sometimes silly– mistakes that can waste precious workout time and energy. Some of these mistakes can even be harmful if not cleaned up and corrected. \\nSo first, let’s start with the good stuff. Follow these five simple treadmill hacks to make sure your next time out is more productive than ever! 1. Mix Things Up \\nThis is the easiest way to turn what is usually the boring drudge of the treadmill into a more exciting way of spending your gym time. Variety is also one of the most important weapons in your fat burning arsenal. Mixing things up will provide your body the challenge it needs to shed unwanted pounds in a hurry. \\nThe simplest way to start doing this is to up your intensity and/or duration. However, this can present some problems in itself. If you work too close to your maximum heart rate, you can easily tire yourself out too quickly. On the other hand, we want to burn calories now and slower, steadier workouts can take longer to show results. \\nThe right variety will help you find that perfect soft spot right in the middle. For some days, just do your usual routine of 20 or 30 minutes a little faster than normal. For other days, go slower and longer for around an hour. We know, nobody wants slow or long; but trust us, just keep reading. 2. Use Intervals of Speed \\nThis is all about pushing your body just far enough to burn the most calories without needing to be carried out the gym. You will want to sprinkle in short bursts of sprinting throughout your workout. Remember that thing we said about keep reading? Well, here is a tip that will help you cut time and pounds in one simple step. \\nResearch shows that running hard for two minutes then slowing down for three will burn more calories than just the boring slow and steady routine. That same research also says doing that will help you drop up to four percent more body fat in a few weeks if done regularly.The best way to do this is with 1:2 intervals. For example, using this technique you would increase your speed for around 30 to 60 seconds then drop it back to normal for 60 to 120 seconds. Make sense? \\nIt could take some time to find that perfect sweet spot of speed intervals since it will be different for each individual. You want a speed that takes effort to hold for two to five minutes but don’t overdo it. The goal is to find the speed that makes you feel invigorated as opposed to one that makes you fall off the treadmill with exhaustion. You can eventually build up to higher speeds, but it will all depend on your experience. Prev post Page 1 of 3 Next Be the first to comment Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

       " ['Wayne Allen Root “It’s Trump or it’s the End of America” | Follow Trump',\n",
       "  '\\nBy Wayne Allen Root – Review Journal \\nThe election is Tuesday. So it’s time to make my final case for Donald J. Trump. My case is pretty simple — it’s Trump or it’s the end of America. \\nI was raised as a middle-class kid in the greatest country in world history. A country built around mobility, opportunity and economic freedom. A country that allowed this son of a butcher to become a successful business owner, media personality, best-selling author and TV star and producer. Only in America. \\nI was taught by my wonderful, patriotic, true red, white and blue, salt-of-the-earth, American parents that certain specific things made America great. Here they are: \\nFaith in God, prayer, love of country, family, a belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, the Constitution, limited government, personal responsibility, economic freedom, the military and police. \\nWell don’t look now. But everything from that list above … everything we believe in … everything that made America great … has been under full-scale assault for eight long years — from multiple directions. And Hillary is here to finish the job. She already publicly stated she wants to be Obama’s third term. \\nThe truth is we either send a strong message heard around the world and elect Trump, or the America we know and love is gone. Forever. \\nBecause if Trump doesn’t win, no other Republican will ever be elected president again. President Hillary Clinton will make sure of that. Hillary will open the borders like never before to let in millions of illegal aliens who have no love for anything that made America great. \\nForeigners come here not out of a love for America, but for a love of the cradle-to-grave welfare state that America has become. Eighty percent of them (or higher) will vote Democrat forever more to keep the welfare checks coming. That’s Hillary’s plan. \\nDon’t believe me? See California. No Republican will ever again be elected to statewide office. This was the exact formula that destroyed California. Open the borders, let in millions of foreigners, make them dependent on government welfare checks and then train them to vote Democrat to keep the handouts coming. \\nIt worked! \\nThat was the experiment. Now Democrats are onto Plan B — to turn the rest of America into California. \\nHillary will open the borders and tie the hands of border agents in order to flood the country with millions of new illegals. Hillary will legalize the 12 million to 15 million or so already here — and give them the right to vote. \\nHillary will also enthusiastically import millions of Muslim refugees who have no love for America, capitalism, the Constitution, or certainly Judeo-Christian values. Some will become terrorists, almost all will require cradle-to-grave welfare. \\nThen it’s over for America. \\nSo vote. Drag your friends to the polls. Make phone calls to your entire address book. Leave no stone unturned. \\nThink of the U.S. Supreme Court. \\nThink of open borders. \\nThink of your children’s and grandchildren’s future. \\nThen vote for Trump like it’s … Trump, or the end of America. \\nBecause it is. \\nWayne Allyn Root is a best-selling author and host of “WAR Now: The Wayne Allyn Root Show” 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. daily at 790 Talk Now. His R-J columns run Wednesdays and Sundays. \\nFor once in our lifetime, we the people have an opportunity to elect a President who was NOT chosen by Multinational Corporations, Big Banks, DC Elites, and the Globalist Lapdog Mainstream Media. \\nPlease like and share if you are a TRUMP VOTER!

       "  'November 12, 2016 348 Ads on Craigslist reveal that paid anti-Trump protesters and Soros-sponsored staged demonstrations are continuing to fuel hate and division. Share on Facebook \\nIt was reported previously on The Duran that MoveOn – a George Soros controlled NGO, is behind the organization of anti-Trump protests across the country. As the protests continue, however, Craigslist has become an important recruitment tool for some of these organizers, and here is what it reveals: \\nFight the Trump Agenda! We’re hiring Full-Time Organizers 15/hr! – reads a Craigslist ad from Washington CAN in Seattle . Activists are promised Medical, Dental, Vision, 401(k), Paid Vacation, Paid Sick Days, Holidays, and Leave of Absence . \\nWashington CAN claims to be the state’s oldest and largest grassroots non-profit with over 35 years of organizational experience. It is unclear whether it has any direct ties to Soros’s MoveOn, but it certainly wouldn’t be a wild assumption to make under the circumstances. \\nIn another instance, a Craigslist ad exposed paid Anti-Trump protesters being recruited for a staged event in Los Angeles. And this time the Soros link is quite clear and in the open. TruthFeed reports: \\nIn this case, a Craigslist ad in Los Angeles shows that activists are wanted to block traffic in the heavy traffic intersection of Highlands and Hollywood. \\nHere’s an example of a Soros employee literally “posing” as a protester. Not all that “grass roots.” \\nObviously, no one is disputing the fact that there are millions of people unhappy with the election results. Neither is there any doubt that thousands across the the country are protesting genuinely out of emotion and desire to express their discontent. What’s important is that these people realize that they are playing right into the hands of an establishment agenda that doesn’t have America’s best interests in mind. \\nThe election is over and we have a clear winner. The losing side has conceded, admitting that the election was fair and calling for a peaceful transition of power. For all the smart folks out there this is a clear indication that it’s time to go home, back to school, back to work, back to your daily routine and stop trying to prolong the division and hate that has been eating away at this country for far too long.

       " ['Dear Foreign Friends, Here’s Why Trump Won (From A Clevelander) | Katehon think tank. Geopolitics & Tradition',\n",
       "  'Home » Dear Foreign Friends, Here’s Why Trump Won (From A Clevelander) Dear Foreign Friends, Here’s Why Trump Won (From A Clevelander) Andrew Korybko \\nHi everybody. As you may know, I’m an American who was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, although I made a life decision four years ago to permanently leave the US and move to the Russian Federation. If you’re interested in my specific background and what motivated me to take that step, I suggest that you check out the interview that I gave to Serbian-American journalist Stephen Karganovic about this last spring when I visited him in Belgrade. \\nI’m addressing you all directly in a form which I never use in my articles, and that’s the first-person. I know that so many of you guys are confused and struggling to understand why Trump won, and I totally understand what you’re feeling because it’s very difficult for any foreigner to truly comprehend what just happened in the US. The best way for me to convey this to you all is to talk on a personal level in the hopes that my delivery will get through to you. I’m not expecting anyone to agree with the points that I make, but just to understand what motivated Trump supporters to get out to the polls and shake up The Establishment. \\nAlthough I don’t live in the US anymore, I was born and raised in one of the most quintessential representations of what constitutes modern-day “average America”, and that’s Cleveland, Ohio. Despite being nearly halfway across the world, I never lost touch with where I came from and will always remember the formative experiences which shaped my worldview. I still stay in contact with my American family and several close friends so I remain up to date on what’s going on “back home”, and as they say, “you can take someone out of their homeland, but you can’t take the homeland out of the person”. \\nFor better or for worse, I’ll always embody certain “American” characteristics forged from my upbringing in Cleveland, and given that these idiosyncrasies are now representative of the prevailing political zeitgeist in the US as evidenced by Trump’s Triumph, I want to share some of them with you all in the hopes that everyone can get a better grasp on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the US today. A man who I call “Uncle Vinny” once inspiringly advised me when I was younger that “the difference between genius and crazy is in getting others to understand you”, so with that wisdom in mind, here’s the best that I can do in trying to help all my foreign friends understand the mentality of the typical Trump supporter. \\nSo many toxic individuals said that I and tens of millions of other people were “racists”, “fascists”, and “white supremacists” just because we’ve been publicly sharing our observations over the past year and a half that Trump’s rhetoric and platform represent the desires of many Americans, but we held our ground and doubled down because we knew that we were right and that the American People would ultimately choose Donald J. Trump to be the next President of the United States. \\nThis is why “outsiders” such as myself and everyone else who rallied behind Trump are so valuable to the larger conversations taking place because we consistently break through the narrow-minded groupthink of The Establishment and express what’s really going on, “political correctness” be damned. No foreigner can ever fully understand what happened yesterday, not even if they lived in the US for years unless they experienced what the middle class (not the academic-governmental-business class) experienced for their entire lives. \\nMichael Moore, who’s also a native of the “Rust Belt” like myself and understands the mentality of the millions of Americans who revolted against The Establishment and historically broke through Hillary’s Midwest “firewall”, conveyed the reason why voters in this dilapidated and socio-economically “backward/forgotten” corner of the US would flock towards Trump in an address which was ironically supposed to be against the future President-elect. Trump supporters, however, decided to turn the most relevant and motivational part of Moore’s speech into a YouTube video filled with dramatic images and music, and I strongly suggest that everyone take five minutes out of their day to listen to what he had to say. \\nWhen you live a life surrounded by drugs, poverty, crime, potholes, and hopelessness, the only thing that you feel that you have going for you are the sexual, alcoholic, and musical distractions that The Establishment shoves down everyone’s throat each and every day in order to placate the masses by “making it all better” just for a little bit of (“fun”) time. Turn off the TV or go to sleep after the party, and the same problems that people sought to escape from are still there the very next morning and not a damned thing has tangibly changed for the better, except that some people have now found a socially acceptable “go-to medicine” for dealing with the repulsive reality that they feel they have to put up with each and every day for the rest of their lives. \\nA lot of Americans where I’m from don’t know what a “real vacation” is, in that they don’t go globetrotting around the world like the Europeans do on what they call their “holidays”. Many Midwesterners even have a hard time going from one part of the country to another just for fun because it’s a huge financial burden for the average Clevelander in our cheap and low-wage economy to gather up the funds necessary to jet set out to costly California just to take in some sunshine, for example. Another thing that most foreigners don’t realize is that people from my part of the country don’t even have the vacation/holiday days like the rest of the world does. If you’re working a low-wage service-sector job or are in a low-level office position, then you might never receive two back-to-back weeks of vacation in your life. If you get married, the best that you can dream for is a honeymoon to Niagara Falls for a week and that’s it, just because it’s conveniently nearby and not overly expensive. \\nWe grew up our whole lives hearing from The Establishment and its media shills how “great” and “powerful” the US is, how it’s the “best country in the history of the world”, yet all that we see around us is socio-economic devastation and we can’t imagine how it could ever be any different. So many factories have closed up shop and moved to Mexico, China, and countries that the average American in my part of the US never heard of or can even pronounce, and it’s all because of the post-Cold War globalization that started under Bill Clinton and NAFTA. But at the same time, however, we see that there are indeed some people around us who seem to be living a pretty good life but haven’t had to do much to achieve it. \\n\\nYou foreigners might be shocked to hear this, but a lot of Clevelanders can’t believe that “refugees”, some minorities, and illegal immigrants are able to live ‘high off the hog’ as we say just because of the huge amounts of tax-payer-provided government assistance that they receive for not really doing a lot of anything other than being the “politically correct” category of people that they are. I don’t expect people outside of the US to understand this, and even many Americans who don’t live in the “Rust Belt” (and even some who do) will probably find this to be inconceivable, but so many of these types of folks who I just mentioned – and including a lot of whites, too – abuse the “benefits” system just so that they can get the most amount of free stuff as they can for the absolute least amount of work and effort. \\nIn the “politically correct” dystopian society that the “liberal-progressives” and Cultural Marxists of the Democratic Party have strove to create for decades, the state will house, feed, and pay people just because of their race and class, and while this might have been “originally intended” to temporarily help those who fell on hard times and couldn’t properly help themselves, it has been abused by so many people and turned into a slush fund for paying off loyal leftists who willingly choose to remain indefinitely dependent on The Establishment. These people have made a conscious choice to “settle for less” than they could ever hope to achieve if they worked hard and stayed focused because “The American Dream” is out of reach for many of them in this part of the country and they figured out how easy it is to scheme the system and have other Americans subsidize the less-than-ideal lifestyles that they’ve settled for. \\nRemember, I’m not asking you guys to agree with any of what I’ve written, but I’m just telling you as a “voice from the inside” about why so many people in Ohio and the “Rust Belt” support Trump and are drawn to his promises to smash The Establishment that they’ve spent their whole lives seeing steal from them, neglect them, and unjustly help others who pledge their loyalty to the existing state of affairs. Don’t forget that it was people who think the way that I just described who decisively changed the course of American history on Election Day, and they take pride in being “politically incorrect” and rebelling against the system that they feel has held them down their entire lives. Be it through the abovementioned examples of unfairness and injustice, or through the incessant attempts to dismantle their identity by suppressing and trashing their religious liberties and traditions, people in the “Rust Belt” have had enough. \\nSee, that’s the thing that foreigners don’t realize, and it’s that Americans in this part of the country feel that they’re living under the boot of a tyrannical and totalitarian ideology which censors their dissent with “racist”, “fascist”, and “white supremacist” reputation-killing accusations and works 24/7/365 to brainwash them into thinking that they – and not the system – are the problem. Imagine George Orwell’s 1984 and you’ll have an idea about how a lot people view the ideology of “political correctness”. It is so pervasive, so controlling, that those who are suffering under it were bound to eventually revolt once the time was ripe. All of these anti-“political correctness” dissidents thought that they were alone and were the “crazy outlier” amongst their brainwashed compatriots, but then Donald Trump came along and gave them all the signal that this was the historic moment that they had been waiting their entire lives for to finally rebel against this totalitarian ideology. If there was no “political correctness”, then there would never have risen a Donald Trump to save the hard-working blue collar folks of the USA. \\nThe majority-blue collar inhabitants of the “Rust Belt” have been voiceless for decades and were seething with rage this whole time. They couldn’t speak out against the majority-black crime that ravages their neighborhoods because otherwise they’d be tarred and feathered as “racists”. They couldn’t condemn globalization and the outsourcing of their livelihoods to Mexico, China, and other countries or else they’d be mercilessly attacked as “fascists”. God forbid these people ever spoke publicly about building a wall with Mexico to stop the tens of millions of illegal immigrants and uncountable tons of deadly narcotics that have flooded the US since NAFTA, since then they’d be called the ultimate insult and accused of being “white supremacists”. These people thought that they were largely alone with their feelings because the system did such an effective job of self-censoring them and thus separating them from the silent majority of likeminded Americans, but then Donald Trump emerged on the scene and millions of people were finally united via his rallies and social-alternative medias to finally muster up the courage to collectively resist The Establishment and its allied social-pop culture-academic-political elite’s intimidation. \\nWhen Election Day came, these dispossessed Americans didn’t back down and buy into The Establishment’s propaganda that Hillary was going to trounce Trump with an historic landslide but instead went to vote anyhow, knowing that this was the only hope left for them to ever possibly change their inescapably dismal life situations. \\nThe most intense psychological warfare operation ever conducted against Americans was a complete failure. The Establishment’s War on the People sought to convince them that Trump didn’t stand a chance to win and that voting for him just showed how “racist”, “fascist”, and “white supremacist” you were. “Political correctness”, globalization, and the unfettered illegal immigration and unvetted “refugee” resettlement of millions of people who staunchly refuse to assimilate and integrate into American Society or even speak English is just a fact of life that these “deplorable” citizens will be forced to put up and deal with until they die (or are killed by some of the “new arrivals” who flocked into their hometowns). But The Establishment and its social-pop culture-academic-political shills were wrong and Trump supporters knew it because they had finally connected with one another and were convinced that they truly embodied the silent majority, and the frustration, hopelessness, and pain that comes every single day living in a “politically correct” system is what sent millions of Americans into a rage against the system which was so widespread that it became impossible for Hillary to steal the election. \\nThe War on the People was waged by Americans, on Americans, and against everything that the silent majority believes that America stands for, which is why it was totally unprecedented in American history. Not even the divide-and-rule Color Revolution tactics that The Establishment dangerously and irresponsibly relied on with the help of George Soros and his “Black Lives Matter” urban extremists could succeed in intimidating the Trump Movement and compelling them to stop, which testifies to the deep conviction that Trump supporters have in their beliefs and the hope that they have that their candidate of choice will finally free them from the misery that has come to define their lives. \\nDear foreign friends, forget everything that you may have ever thought about the US system, national ideology, and the American People – from here on out, you and 99% of all other non-American observers begin at Day 1 in working to understand the inner nuances of Trump Country and Trump’s America. My state of Ohio had the highest honor of being the biggest upset to Hillary Clinton by 9%, something which has shocked The Establishment. We, the people of Ohio, are the heart of Trumpland. He didn’t win by a few percentage points like in every other swing state, but by almost double digits. This should be more than enough proof that everything that I, as a born-and-raised Clevelander, am revealing to you about how and why Trump won the “Rust Belt” and broke through Hillary’s firewall. Where I’m from, people don’t just have 1 or 2 Trump signs in their yard – they have 5, 10, or 20 of them, especially if they live in the farmland right outside of the city. \\nI’m not expecting you to understand everything that I wrote, let alone to agree with it, but I felt obligated to do the best that I can to inform you all about why Trump won and the reasons behind the “Rust Belt” revolt against The Establishment which handed him the Presidency. For all of what you might think are their personal and ideological faults, Trump supporters feel validated by this election because it proved that the system and all of its shills were lying about Hillary’s “imminent landslide” this entire time. What had been derided for over a year and a half as the “conspiratorial thinking” of a “vast right-wing conspiracy” (one with phantasmal and invented links to the Russian secret services) was exposed as a fact – The Establishment was indeed lying this entire time and desperately waged what amounts to the most intense psychological operation against Americans ever conducted in history, and that’s the War on the People. Nobody can deny it any longer, the facts are the facts and all the “official” “thinkers”, pundits, and “experts” were wrong because they either deliberately refused to recognize the reality that was before their eyes or were complicit in siding with the system out of the self-interested expectation that they’ll somehow end up benefiting from its perpetuation. \\nTough times are ahead, and the nation is more divided and polarized than ever before, though this is largely due to the lingering psychological effects of The Establishment’s War on the People than anything else. The Second American Revolution was indeed a victory of the American People over The Establishment, but it’s now under threat from the Clintonian Counter-Revolution that’s broken out in the streets of many pro-Democrat American cities. It’s the height of irony that the people who just a few days ago criticized Trump for not pledging to blindly respect the results of the vote are now the ones who don’t recognize its outcome and are poised to tear America’s inner cities apart just because they couldn’t pull off stealing the election of our lifetime. \\nI don’t think anybody knows how far the rioters will be directed/misled by their Hillary-Soros-neoconservative handlers to go, nor how President-elect Trump will respond to their unrest once he takes office in mid-January, but what I can in fact tell each and every one of you without an inkling of doubt in my mind is that the Trump supporters of the Midwestern “Rust Belt” who helped hand him his victory in the first place will form the vanguard Second Amendment-wielding citizens leading the Reverse-Color Revolution movement to legally safeguard the 45th President’s constitutional legitimacy if things disastrously get out of control.

       "  'Email Print One of my top candidates for Attorney General just gave Hillary Clinton a little truth bomb for dinner. While appearing with Megyn Kelly and discussing the reopening of the FBI investigation against Hillary Clinton, Gowdy said Hillary’s attitude and defensiveness is “…just too rich.” In essence, she is getting exactly what she deserves… Gowdy stated something I commented on earlier in the day, stating, “The same person who went to great lengths to make sure that these emails were private now, all of a sudden, wants it all made public.” This is grandstanding by Hillary, nothing more. As an attorney, and as Secretary of State, Hillary knows the FBI CAN NOT release any information about an ongoing investigation. She also knows that due to the complexity of the case, it could take months before We the People hear anything from the FBI about this investigation. This is nothing Comey is doing to hurt her in the campaign or any type of conspiracy, this is just how the system works. The arrogance of Clinton is now demanding we get that information immediately, which would mean expediting her case and devoting thousands of extra man hours, probably all overtime, at tax payers expense! That, my friends, is what we would call privilege. And I don’t want to hear her argument that because she is running for president she is entitled because We the People were also supposed to be entitled to a Secretary of State that was not corrupt! Hilary wrote this narrative on her own. She decided to use a private server for government communications, something NOBODY else in our government was doing or was allowed to do. She broke the rules, and now that there is an attempt to hold her accountable for it, she wants exceptions. Gowdy is right, this is rich, because if Hillary had simply followed the rules, she would not be in this mess in the first place! But, then again, there is a reason we have jails… because criminals never follow the rules! And Mr. Gowdy, if Hillary truly gets what she deserves, her address will be changed to one of those prisons very soon!

       "  ' US Will Never Separate its Fighters from \\x91Islamists\\x92 Because it Depends on Them By Dan Glazebrook\\nNovember 08, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" RT \" - It was the big idea that was supposed to herald a new era of US-Russian co-operation in Syria: the separation of Western-backed \\x91moderate rebels\\x92 from groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda, in order that the former could be brought into political negotiations whilst the latter were targeted by combined US and Russian military operations. Russia and Syria managed to get the UN Security Council to agree to a ban on the funding, training and arming of foreign fighters joining such groups back in September 2014, whilst the US-Russia ceasefire agreement this September reiterated that \\x93separating moderate opposition forces from Nusra [Al Qaeda\\x92s Syria affiliate, now rebranded as Jabhat Fatah Al-Sham]\\x94 was \\x93a key priority\\x94. As Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov recalled at a press conference last week, \\x93our agreements with the Americans linked this separation to a seven-day period of quiet. At the end of the period, the Americans undertook to show us on the map exactly where they believed there were terrorists and where there were none. On this basis, we should have jointly coordinated targets for effective engagement. To reiterate, they requested seven days for that, insisting that a seven-day pause should be a precondition. We announced this pause but it was violated with a strike against Syrian Army detachments three days later\\x94 \\x96 when, lest we forget, British and US bomber jets carried out a sustained attack on Syrian army troops fighting ISIS in Deir al-Zour, killing 62 and wounding over 100, effectively burying the ceasefire. Nevertheless, in response to Western demands, Syrian and Russian planes again suspended airstrikes on Aleppo two weeks ago, giving the US another chance to make good on its promises to \\x91separate\\x92 its favoured rebel factions from the Al Qaeda affiliate, the Nusra Front. A fortnight later, however \\x96 and fully ten months after his initial public call (at an International Syria Support Group meeting in February) for so-called \\x91moderates\\x92 to separate themselves from Al Qaeda and co \\x96 Kerry was still pleading for them to have more time to do so.\\nEvents on the ground, meanwhile, have been moving entirely in the other direction. More and more of the groups supposedly fighting under the West\\x92s \\x91Free Syrian Army\\x92 banner (never much more than a fiction to which militias could pledge mythical allegiance in exchange for Western finance and weaponry) have been fighting with the Al Nusra-led Jaysh Al-Fateh (Army of Conquest) alliance since it was launched in March last year. Indeed, so successful has this formation been \\x96 both in terms of capturing territory, mainly in Idlib province, and in establishing Nusra\\x92s hegemony over the various insurgent factions \\x96 that its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, apparently believes the \\x91grand merger\\x92 of rebel groups he has long dreamed of, fully integrated under a Nusra chain of command, is now a realistic possibility.\\nIt is no surprise, then, that it is precisely this Nusra-led formation that has been leading the \\x91rebel\\x92 onslaught against government-held Western Aleppo launched last Friday, complete with car bombs, rockets and mortars directed against residential areas. These are thought to have killed at least 41 civilians, including 16 children, in \\x93relentless and indiscriminate\\x94 raids that have \\x93shocked and appalled\\x94 the UN Special Envoy to Syria Steffan de Mistura. The Independent\\x92s Robert Fisk, reporting from the area following a rebel rocket attack, described \\x93a younger boy [lying] on a hospital trolley, a doctor picking metal out of his face, all his limbs heavily bandaged. He was writhing in agony, moving his legs wildly, comforted by the director of the school\\x94.\\nWill attacks like these, then, increase the urgency with which the US pursues its supposed desire to separate the groups in receipt of its largesse from their \\x91Al Qaeda lite\\x92 allies?\\nThis is highly unlikely: Syrian foreign minister Walid Muallem was probably correct when he stated last week that the US is unwilling to separate the factions its backs from Al Nusra, despite its repeated commitments to do so, for two main reasons.\\nFirstly, rebel groups have openly targeted civilians since 2011, often on the basis of ethnicity, religion or political beliefs, and this has never bothered their Western backers before. Indeed, the rebels \\x96 then operating under the banner of the pro-Western Free Syrian Army \\x96 heralded their entry in Aleppo in 2012 with two massive car bombs in the city centre and the burning down of the city\\x92s centuries-old souks. This was followed up with a bomb attack on Aleppo University on January 15 th 2013, killing 80, as part of the rebels\\x92 \\x91morale bombing\\x92 campaign against those supporters of the government. Two months later, one Syrian soldier and 19 civilians were killed in the village of Khan Al-Assal near Aleppo in a gas attack suspected by the UN Mission investigating it to have been carried out by the opposition. And as early as December 2012, Channel 4 News were reporting on suspected massacres of Alawite civilians by \\x91Free Syrian Army\\x92 fighters, massacres which have been a mainstay of rebel activities. Far from dampening Western enthusiasm for the rebel cause, this particular report was followed up with calls by David Cameron to step up its assistance to the insurgency, who promised a doubling of British aid to the rebels within months. The targeting of civilians has never damaged Western support in the past, and is unlikely to do so now.\\nSecondly, aside from ISIS and the Syrian army, Jabhat Fateh Al-Sham and Ahrar Al Sham are clearly the most effective fighting groups on the ground, and the other rebel factions and its Western backers clearly understand this. And again, this is nothing new; sectarian Salafist groups have been the leading force in the insurgency since the start, as the West has always been fully aware. The now notorious US Defence Intelligence Agency memo of 12 th August 2012, for example \\x96 which was circulated to, amongst others, the State Department, the CIA, the FBI and Central Command \\x96 noted that\\x93the Salafist [sic], the Muslim Brotherhood, and AQI [al-Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.\\x94 And to prevent any ambiguity, DIA chief at the time, Michael Flynn, then confirmed in an interview with Al Jazeera\\x92s Mehdi Hassan, that the US government\\x92s backing of such forces was not based on ignorance, nor a mistake, but was rather a \\x93willful decision\\x94. Such groups have always been the \\x91driving force\\x92 of the West\\x92s anti-Syria operation, and the US government understands well that its insurgency would soon fizzle out without them. As the US\\x92s primary aim remains regime change rather than the defeat of terrorism, therefore, they are unlikely to make any serious attempt to divide their proxies from the fighting forces of Al Qaeda. We can, instead, expect more pleas for time from the likes of John Kerry, and more spurious rhetoric about the US commitment to fighting terrorism, combined with continued material support for the very groups now openly allied to Al Qaeda. In other words: more of the sordid same.'],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nMOSCOW, November 25. /TASS/. At least six Russian athletes are suspected of bribing officials of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for concealing positive doping samples, the German TV Channel ARD reported on Friday, citing investigation materials of the Paris Prosecutor’s Office. \\nThe Paris Prosecutor’s Office has opened a probe into the suspicions of financial fraud at the world’s athletics governing body in 2014. According to the data received by ARD from the probe’s materials, IAAF representatives demanded from 300,000 euros to 700,000 euros from six Russian athletes for not disclosing the data on their positive doping samples. \\nThe ARD footage also notes that former head of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF) Valentin Balakhnichev was an intermediary in the corruption schemes of former IAAF President Lamine Diack: about 1.5 million euros passed hands through the ARAF ex-chief. \\nDiack has denied his complicity in the doping cover-up scandal, saying he would have never demanded any money from athletes. Nonetheless, as the TV channel says, the six Russians are not the sole athletes who are forced to give bribes. About 23 athletes are mentioned in the probe, ARD said. \\nAccording to the TV Channel, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) may also be involved in the doping cover-up scandal. WADA Chief Craig Reedie earlier asserted he had never heard about any cases of extortion inside the IAAF. However, in the autumn of 2014, the WADA sent a letter to the IAAF Ethics Commission with information on suspected doping samples of Russian athletes, and also about its suspicions of the athletes’ possible blackmailing by the IAAF. Despite this, the world’s anti-doping body took no efforts to open a probe into this information. \\n{{item.group_date}} '],\n",

       " ['Politics, Soul Ages And The Bifurcation Of Worlds : In5D Esoteric, Metaphysical, and Spiritual Database',\n",
       "  'By In5D on November 15, 2016 in Awareness , Spiritual Awakening \\nby Kim Hutchinson, Guest writer, In5D.com \\nPreface: I wrote this article to help people who are unhappy with American election results. I hope it helps to bring you peace and understanding. The Election \\nWednesday morning when I awoke to news of Donald Trump’s ascendancy to the position of President of the United States my first reaction was disbelief. I found myself wondering if I had jumped timelines overnight. Although I did my best to ignore the campaign that waged south of the border, with so many high octane soundbites it was impossible to tune out. Consequently, I was sure Hilary Clinton was a shoe-in. \\nTo shake off the surreal vibe, I headed to the kitchen for a bracing cup of coffee. Thinking that the biggest shock of my day was now behind me, I was ill-prepared for the turmoil that lurked on my laptop. Facebook and email were abuzz with upset posts. Although there were plenty of celebratory message by elated Trump supporters, the majority of reactions I read were negative. Even more distressing were the conflicts that erupted online between friends and coworkers. \\nRather than weighing into the fray, I energetically cleared myself and readjusted my focus to a higher perspective . I then channeled divine love and sent it out into the world for all in need of reassurance. While in communion with my highest self, I also put my faith in my highest self to bring me divine guidance so I could help people deal with their distress. This is when I was reminded of my activities the day prior. Soul Ages \\nOn Tuesday, the day of the U.S. election, I was guided to revisit a book I had read several years ago called The Instruction. In it, author and psychic Ainslie MacLeod described soul ages in a very enlightening manner. Before I proceed in explaining the difference in soul ages, I should point out that all souls are the same age because we are eternal, but we employ the term ‘soul age’ as an indication of the amount of Earth / 3D experience a being has. Young and Old Souls \\nFor simplicity sake, MacLeod broke soul ages into 10 levels. He then sub-divided them into two groups. The first five levels represent young souls, with the remaining five being old souls. Each Earth lesson mastered helps the soul to mature. Souls who complete their Earthly education finish at Level 10. At this point, the soul is ready to ‘graduate’ or ascend Home. \\nThe difference between young and old souls is their primary motivation. Young souls are motivated by fear, leading to the need for security, safety and ultimately, power. Old souls are motivated by love, which drives their need to self-perfect, self-heal and ultimately transcend polarity back into unity consciousness and divine love. This is not to say that young souls are unloving and old souls are never scared. Both young and old souls feel fear and love. Young Souls and Politics \\nA soul’s journey begins with the basics of Level 1, and then progresses through the levels, learning increasingly more complex lessons as it goes. Young souls are driven by a need to protect themselves. Weapons, walls, armies, and strictly enforced laws are all part of that protection. They crave structure and conformity in their personal lives too. This includes moral codes, fundamental religious practices and a traditional family and social structures. The younger the soul the more black-and-white his or her perspective. \\nAt Level 4 the soul has acquired enough 3D/Earth experience to start branching out into the world. Evolving from fear to love is hard, but given enough time and experience most young souls eventually master their fear to become paragons of confidence, worldliness and leadership. In fact, the majority of politicians are Level 5 souls. This is the group who rules the world. They thrive on power, money and prestige. \\nIt’s interesting to note that Level 5 politicians rely heavily on the support of Level 3 souls, such as in the case of war. The politicians who make the decision to engage in conflict need soldiers to fight, the majority of whom come from Level 3. In turn, Level 3 souls tend to idealize their leaders, along with their country, so this is truly a symbiotic relationship. Old Souls \\nBy contrast, Levels 6 – 10 are old souls. They look inwards for strength, guidance and inspiration . \\nLevel 6 is the hardest in some ways because they remember feeling on top of the world and having all the answers. Now, they’ve gone through a spiritual awakening which shattered their paradigm and left them unsure of themselves and their world. Through a spiritual connection, they begin to find their way, eventually regaining their sense of purpose. \\nSubsequent levels draw heavily on intuition to help them bring amazing creations, inventions and works of art into the world. At Level 8 many became activists for worthy causes such as environmental issues. This frequently pits them against the younger souled politicians. By Level 9, the soul is knee-deep in self-healing. \\nThen, by Level 10, souls are so peaceful in their own skin that they no longer are concerned with prior Earthly pursuits. These senior citizen souls are quite baffling to young souls who see them as eccentric and rather strange. In fact, old souls and their ways, tend to scare young souls. Soul Ages and the US Election \\nBy now, you’ve probably figured out that connection between soul ages and the President Elect Donald Trump. In case not, it’s very simple: Trump ran on a platform that appealed to young souls. The concepts of wall-building and limiting immigration, for example, appeal to people who are innately afraid of what lies beyond their borders. Think back to the Middle Ages and earlier, when the majority of souls were young, and thus needed the protective walls of fortified towns. The concept may seem archaic to old souls but, rather than judging, it’s important to keep in mind that every old soul went through a similar young soul journey. Collective consciousness may have evolved beyond medieval times, but there are still pockets of souls who are learning young soul lessons. Earth School \\nTaking the educational model a step farther, imagine Earth as a one room schoolhouse. Grades 1 – 12 (soul ages 1 – 10) are all together in the same classroom. The younger students (young souls) on the left side and the older students (old souls) on the right. Within those two sides, students are grouped together with others in the same grade level so that they can learn cooperatively. Throughout each day, the teacher (life) delivers lessons to each group. Afterward, students work on their assignments with the help of their peers. \\nOld souls tend to forget what it is like to be a young soul, just as young souls struggle to understand old souls . Such is life. Even though we’re all here together, we’re not all working on the same lessons at the same time. \\nLife is based on mastery learning; souls learn at their own pace. Some have lived 100s or even 1000s of past lives, whereas others have only been here a handful of times. It’s important to keep that perspective when dealing with souls who are at different levels than you. After all, it is folly to expect a student in grade 2 to understand grade 11 Calculus. That doesn’t mean the student won’t one day excel at Calculus; it’s just not going to happen in this lifetime. The Bifurcation of Worlds \\nThe election in the US shone a spotlight on the chasm between young and old souls. That gap was always there, but now everyone is acutely aware of it. I believe the election is serving as a catalyst for the separation in worlds. Old souls are preparing to graduate and go on to university ( ascend into 5D ), whereas the young souls are staying here to carry on with their 3D education. The divisiveness and shocking nature of the election campaign and results is helping to polarize the two soul groups while, at the same time, awakening those who would like to move into the higher dimensions. The Solution? Old Soul Compassion \\nAlthough it can be hard for everyone to see eye-to-eye, the ‘burden’ of compassion and understanding, rests on the shoulders of the old soul . If you’re reading this article, I assume you’re an old soul, therefore this message is for you: You, Old Soul, have the experience and wisdom needed to find a place of loving compassion in your heart for the struggle of the young souls. You also have the ability to channel love and peace into the world through your heart and soul connection. The vibration of love is much higher, and therefore far more powerful, than fear and hate. \\nSo, when you see something that causes you fear and/or anger, resist the urge to give into the darkness. Instead, meditate; or, clear yourself, breathe deeply; and think of somebody you love in order to move your consciousness into your heart. Then, focus on the peace within, and let your divine love flow outward in all directions. In doing so you are helping to heal the very influence that upset you while also raising your vibration and that of the ascending Earth. Addendum: Beyond Soul Ages \\nAs a side note, I wish to add that soul ages are but one factor at play here. Not all pro-Trump votes came from young souls. In fact, many old souls chose Trump due to his lack of affiliation, and unwillingness to cooperate, with the puppet masters who have long wielded the true power behind the government. This, too, is part of the transformation and separation of worlds.

       " ['Fascism Over Farmers? The Troubling Priorities of the American Government | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World US Foods Holding Corporation and Sysco, the two top American food distribution giants, are laying off thousands of workers. Wal-Mart is closing stores and terminating employees. As the price of eggs, beef, cheese, and almost all agricultural products have dropped, farmers across the United States are facing financial ruin. The ongoing glut in agricultural products is not merely the natural cycle of the market at work. Policies of the US federal government are directly linked to the low food prices. While it is clear that the ongoing agricultural surplus is very bad for the US public, the government seems to have other priorities. Broken Promises From Politicians The agricultural prowess of the United States is known across the planet. The current president of China first visited the United States in 1985. He didn’t come to see the Statue of Liberty, or the Washington Monument. Rather, Xi Jinping visited Iowa in order to study the technology and farming techniques employed by some of the most advanced and efficient farmers in the world . Love for the small farmers is voiced by almost all sectors of US political establishment, and almost always has been. The writings of Thomas Jefferson spoke at length about the “yeoman” and his role in an ideal republic. The left-wing folk singer Pete Seeger sang about how “the farmer is man who feeds them all .” Right-wing Radio host Paul Harvey plucked the heart strings of the American public with his “So God Made a Farmer” speech in 1978 . Each election year, American politicians devote special attention to the Iowa caucuses, the first vote in determining who will be the major parties’ respective nominees. As they travel across the Midwestern agricultural state, the presidential hopefuls routinely make all kinds of speeches championing “the hard working farmers.” While politicians are known to make promises to the farmers, and seem to recognize that agriculture is essential to the US economy, the policies of recent years, most of them having bipartisan support, have been anything but beneficial to those who work the land. In the current presidential race, Iowa is hotly contested, with Trump and Clinton very close in the polls. The farm glut, spawned by federal policies, is undoubtedly a big factor . In the first 8 months of 2016, 43 million gallons of milk were poured out due to the glut. According to the Wall Street Journal: “Farmers across the US are pouring out tens of millions of gallons of milk amid massive over glut that has reduced prices and filled warehouses with cheese .” Meanwhile, another WSJ article reports: “Cattle and hog prices hover near the lowest levels in years as U.S. meatpackers produce the largest volume of meat in history .” Between July of 2016 and July of 2017, the price of milk has decreased by 11%. The price of eggs has decreased by 40% . The overproduction and under-consumption of agricultural products can be directly linked to federal policies. Throughout his administration, Barack Obama has repeatedly cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and reduced the amount of food that low income families are able to purchase. The cutting of this federal program directly takes food from the mouths of low-income Americans. Despite the fact that according to the US Department of Agriculture, 13% of American households are now food insecure, the cuts have continued, and hunger is rising among America’s poor . ( l ) In addition to the obvious impact on low-income Americans, the cuts in food stamps have also cut into food sales. Food producing corporations and small farmers have seen a decrease in their sales. Wal-Mart has laid off thousands of workers and closed thousands of stores. These losses and layoffs can be linked directly to the SNAP cuts . Congress has recently discussed a plan that would eventually take $150 billion out of the federal food assistance program, a move that would undoubtedly push a lot of food producers, retail employees, and meat packers over the edge, along with many others . The reductions in food assistance are not the only factor. The economic sanctions against Russia have played a dramatic role in creating the current food glut. The collapse and breaking up of the Soviet Union’s collective farm system during the Yeltsin era of the 1990s dramatically reduced Russia’s domestic food production. This opened up new markets for American farmers, who greatly increased their exports to the former USSR. However, the new sanctions imposed in 2014, which restrict US and EU agricultural sales to Russia, have dramatically changed the landscape of the global food market. American farmers have been deprived of 143.5 million potential customers due to the ban on selling to those living in the Russian Federation. Austerity & Fascism Leave Farmers Behind Why is food assistance to low income families being cut? The claim is that the US federal budget is too large, and that hard economic times mandate austerity. However, the United States still has the largest military budget on the planet. When it comes time to reduce spending, rather than cutting the amount of money spent on tanks, bombs, and drones, the politicians have opted to cut into the nutrition of low-income Americans, along with the livelihoods of farmers and agricultural workers. The thousands of military bases around the world, along with the billions given in foreign military aid to countries like Israel, all seem be far more important to US leaders. And why has the US drastically restricted the exporting agricultural products to Russia? The sanctions were enacted in 2014, in response to the Ukraine crisis. The elected President of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovich, was toppled in orgy of street violence. The new government, with a base of support only in the western regions of the country, has within its ranks many open admirers of Adolf Hitler, and is very hostile to Russia. Since 2014, the people of Eastern Ukraine have taken up arms to resist the new regime. The people in the region of Crimea voted to become apart of the Russian Federation, whose military they had been hosting since the collapse of the USSR. Sanctions were imposed on Russia and continue, based on allegations that Russia is supporting the resistance of people in the Eastern regions against the new, pro-Western regime. US leaders tell us the sanctions are intended to punish Russia for “meddling” in Ukraine. Since the passing of the sanctions, Russia has revived its own domestic agricultural programs. Small farmers across Russia are producing beef, wheat, and other products no longer sold to them by the US and the EU. Russian agriculture has experienced a boom since 2014, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is even more popular than prior to the crisis . The decision of US leaders to wage economic warfare against Russia in support of Ukrainian fascists, while at the same time cutting assistance to low-income American families, is contrary to values often displayed throughout American history. Both Lincoln and Roosevelt saw prosperity for the agricultural heartland of the United States and the millions who lived in it as vitally important for the entire country. These two most beloved Presidents in US history both worked closely in alliance with small farmers, often in opposition to Wall Street bankers with different interests. The rallying cry of the Republican Party in its early years, was “Free Land, Free Labor, Free Men!” The “Free Soilers,” farmers who wanted to halt the expansion of slavery in new US territories were an essential part of it. While slavery found support in the financial districts of London and New York, the small farmers had a material interest in ending the barbaric practice, and anti-slavery militias appeared in Iowa and Kansas years before the Civil War broke out. It was a broad coalition of small farmers, religious abolitionists, and organized labor that eventually put Abraham Lincoln into the White House where he was forced to battle the slaveholders. The process that unfolded recreated the country, in what is widely called “The Second American Revolution.” “An American Government Cannot Allow Americans To Starve” The programs that preceded the currently existing Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) were the brainchild of Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, who eventually became the Vice President. When the first “food stamps” were issued in 1939, the director of the program, Milo Perkins described it this way: “We got a picture of a gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm .” While Roosevelt was universally hated by Wall Street bankers, he was very popular with organized labor, artists and musicians, as well as small farmers. As the unemployment councils and labor unions fought for a better life across the country, Roosevelt aligned himself with the mass movement in the streets. Essential in Roosevelt’s progressive coalition was the US Communist Party, an organization that sought to build a “Workers and Farmer’s Government.” When big business objected to Roosevelt’s dramatic economic reforms, he defended them by saying “An American government cannot allow Americans to Starve .” Roosevelt later aligned with the Russian people in order to defeat Adolf Hitler. FDR’s opposition to fascism and his policies of feeding of hungry Americans while subsidizing farmers were not isolated from each other. They corresponded with his overall view of the world, expressed in 1944: “We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people—whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth- is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill housed, and insecure….We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence….People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made .” In 2016, things are very different. While banks were bailed out without hesitation during the 2008 financial crisis, financial assistance to low income Americans continues to be cut. Wall Street and London see the Eurasian Bloc of Russia and China as a rising competitor to their financial hegemony. The wealthy financial elite largely support sanctions and further isolation of both countries despite whatever disastrous impact on American farmers, agricultural workers, and food distributors. Children across the United States are hungry, as 13% of households are food insecure, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Farm workers and those who work for food distributors and supermarkets are losing their jobs. Gallons of milk are at this moment being dumped out in hopes of raising the prices, while food warehouses sit filled with rotting, unsold cheese. Meanwhile, US and NATO forces are increasing their presence in Eastern Europe, threatening Russia. As agricultural sanctions on Russia continue, weapons and training are being provided to a Ukrainian military that is known to contain a number fascist sympathizers, including the infamous Azov Battalion. As discontent rises in the United States, it is largely centered in the agricultural and de-industrialized mid-western heartland. It is clear that many Americans desperately want something to change. A government that prioritizes fascism in Ukraine over farmers in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Ohio, is clearly out of touch. Caleb Maupin is a political analyst and activist based in New York.

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nHaving soared to fresh 13 year highs in a quiet overnight session on thin liquidity due to the US Thanksgiving holiday, which sent the USDJPY just shy of 114 and the Yuan to 6.96, the dollar pared back its weekly advance with modest profit taking after traders wondered if the rally has gotten “too stretched.” European shares were fractionally higher, with Asian stocks and US equity futures rising and both the Dow Jones and the S&P set for new all time highs. Oil followed the USD lower, down fractionally ahead of next week’s OPEC meeting where negotiations now focus on whether non-OPEC led by Russia nations will cut or freeze. \\nWith the US offline yesterday, American markets are set for another early close on Black Friday: U.S. equity markets close at 1pm, bond markets close at 2pm. \\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell from the highest level in more than a decade, while emerging-market currencies clawed back gains after India’s rupee and Turkey’s lira fell to record lows on Thursday. U.S. equity-index futures signaled stocks will edge higher as trading resumes following the Thanksgiving holiday. European shares were little changed, oil pared a weekly gain and Treasuries fell. \\nThe recurring story every day since Trump’s election is that as a result of the upcoming debt-funded fiscal stimulus, inflation is poised to jump which in turn has fueled a surge in bets on Federal Reserve rate hikes, propelling the greenback higher against all but two of it peers this month. Traders see an increase in borrowing costs in December as a certainty, while the odds of additional moves by June have risen to more than 60 percent, according to futures data tracked by Bloomberg . \\nAs shown virtually every day on these pages, the “Trumpflation” bet on global reflation has sent the USD soaring, while slamming EM currencies, fading the prospect of future rate cuts by these economies, while industrial metals like copper continue to soar. \\nExpectations of rises in U.S. inflation and interest rates have driven the greenback to a gain of more than 6 percent in October and November combined, its strongest performance over a similar period since its rally in early 2015 . Most investors expect those gains to continue, but a combination of the Thanksgiving break in the United States, market participants’ need to process corporate flows at the end of the month and a raft of risks in the first half of December all speak for cashing in some of those gains now. \\n“The dollar bull run had perhaps become a little stretched,” said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “We’ve had a very strong run since the election and it’s just a bit of a pull back.” \\nIt is Black Friday in the US, and the National Retail Federation projects that about 137.4 million consumers will make purchases in stores or online over the four-day weekend that starts on Thanksgiving, marking the kickoff to the holiday shopping season. U.S. retail spending is expected to rise 3.6% to $655.8 billion in November and December, the Washington-based NRF estimates. Retailers are poised to take full advantage of the Thanksgiving holiday period, now known by some as Black Week, which accounts for about 15 percent of holiday spending, according to the trade group. However, the amount Americans have spent has declined in the last three years, slipping 26 percent from 2013 to an average of $299.60 per person last year, according to the trade group, so there are risks. \\nThis holiday season is expected be better for retailers with unemployment, gasoline prices and inflation low, while wages, home values and the stock market continue to rise. Companies such as Kohl’s Corp., Gap Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc. have said the U.S. presidential election was a major cause of consumers’ recent reluctance to open their wallets. With the outcome settled, they’re expecting the dollars to finally flow. “We’ve had some, we believe, pent-up demand — just based on the economics of our consumer,” J.C. Penney Co. Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison said in an interview this month. “We’re anticipating we’ll see pent-up demand released, and it being post-election will only help that.” \\nAs the following chart of retail stock performance shows, the market is as optimistic as the retailers coming into Black Friday. \\nThe MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was up 0.2% in early European trading and headed to close the week around 1 percent higher. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.7 percent. European equities were steady in morning business, with a rally in defensive sectors such as healthcare and utilities offsetting weaker banking and commodities stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was unchanged, on track for a third straight week of gains. \\nEuropean shares have gained 4.5 percent since Donald Trump’s surprise victory in this month’s U.S. presidential election. “It looks as if the market is taking a breather after a good run. The market view is that Trump is going to spend more and will shield the U.S. more so that we get higher inflation and higher domestic growth,” Ronny Claeys, senior strategist at KBC Asset Management, said. “ The market has reacted positively on Trump, but this could change as his policies are vague at this stage. Investors will react more on his policy details ” Claeys added cited by Reuters . Emerging-market shares are poised for the first weekly increase in more than a month, led by commodity and energy producers. \\nIn rates, U.S. yields gapped higher at the open, rising as high as 2.411%, “but have been unable to hold those gains and that has encouraged some profit-taking,” said Jeremy Stretch, head of currency strategy at CIBC in London, and the 10Y was last trading at 2.37%. “There is a degree of consolidation (but) there is still a consistent bias that means the dollar will remain pretty much supported into the Fed meeting next month. The message seems to be to take some profit and we will be looking to go again.” \\nIn the European bond market, short-dated German government bond yields set a new record low and were on track for their biggest two-week fall in more than three years, highlighting demand for top-rated assets. Demand for German debt for use as collateral for short-term lending in repo markets has helped drive two-year bond yields lower this week . Jitters ahead of an Italian referendum on Dec. 4 has also bolstered demand for German bonds, regarded as among the safest assets in the world. Rates on 10-year German bunds fell two basis points on Friday to 0.24%. Yields on 40-year Japan government bonds slid five basis points to 0.715 percent, reversing an earlier climb after an auction of the debt saw 499.7 billion yen ($4.4 billion) of securities sold at a highest yield of 0.725 percent. “The 40 year bonds were well received in the auction, triggering a bout of bond buying,” said Masahiko Sato, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Tokyo. \\n* * * \\nBulletin Headline Summary from RanSquawk Price action in Europe thus far has been muted amid ongoing holiday-thinned conditions and a lack of notable newsflow A day of profit taking and position adjustment, while month end (real money) flow is also starting to kick in with the USD rally taking another pause Looking ahead, highlights include UK GDP and US Services PMI.

Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) traded choppy throughout the session with the index driven by JPY fluctuations, while ASX 200 (+0.4%) was also higher despite upside being limited by weakness in gold. Hang Seng (+0.5%) conformed to the positive tone while Shanghai Comp (+0.6%) initially lagged amid quiet news flow and after the PBoC reduced its weekly net liquidity injection by around 90% from the prior week. 10yr JGBs were initially pressured amid gains in riskier assets and as yields rose alongside their US counterparts. However, JGBs then recovered from their lows in the wake of a firmer 40yr auction leading to outperformance in the super-long end and curve flattening. PBoC injected CNY 120bIn in 7-day reverse repos, CNY 70bIn in 14-day reverse repos, CNY 25b1n in 28-day reverse repos for a weekly net injection of CNY 40bIn vs. last week’s CNY 425b1n net injection. \\nJapan reported its latest consumer price data, which met or beat most expectations: Japanese National CPI (Oct) Y/Y 0.1% vs. Exp. 0.0% (Prey. -0.5%) Japanese National CPI Ex.

European equities trade flat, with Actellion higher by almost 10% amid talk of a potential merger, with Shire touted as a bidder. To the downside, Banca Monte Paschi traders got their usual morning break as Co. shares were halted limit down once again, this time as a consequence of the EUR 5bIn capital raising. Fixed income and commodity markets have been equally dull, with Bunds marginally higher today amid light volumes and little to drive price action.

Japan’s currency gained 0.4 percent to 112.80 per dollar. It’s down 1.8 percent in the week, the worst performance among major currencies. The rupee strengthened 0.4 percent after sinking to a record low Thursday, while the Turkish lira gained 0.3 percent. China’s yuan, which fell to an eight-year low against the dollar this week, was little changed. The yuan rose this week to an August high versus a basket of peers, signaling that its declines against the greenback have been more moderate than those of other currencies. South Africa’s rand headed for its first weekly gain in three weeks before a credit-rating review by Moody’s Investors Service. \\nIn commodities, West Texas Intermediate crude oil slipped 0.8 percent to $47.58 a barrel. OPEC’s focus has shifted to negotiations with Iran and non-member Russia for production curbs after Iraq’s prime minister signaled it will agree to cut output. Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.7 percent to $1,190.24 an ounce, the first advance in four days. Copper slipped less than 0.1 percent in London and has surged 8.2 percent this week. The industrial metal has soared 21 percent this month. \\nLooking at today’s events, the main focus this morning was on the UK where we got the second estimate of Q3 GDP which came in at 0.5%, as expected. Also in the UK today was the CBI’s Distributive Trades Survey for November which soared from 21 to 26, smashing expectations of a 12 print, while French consumer confidence data is the early print this morning. Markets in the US should be quiet again today but there is some data due out including the remaining flash November PMI’s (services and composite), wholesale inventories and the advance goods trade balance for October. It’ll also be worth keeping an eye on any retail sales data for Black Friday sales in the US. A reminder that this Sunday the second and final round of the French centre-right primary is due to be held. The run-off is between Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe, the former coming out on top in the first round, with the winner going on to be the chosen Republican candidate. We should know the winner around 9pm GMT on Sunday evening. \\nUS Event Calendar 8:30am: Advance Goods Trade Balance, Oct., est. -$59b (prior -$56.5b) 8:30am: Wholesale Inventories m/m, Oct P, est. 0.2% (prior 0.1%); Retail Inventories m/m, Oct. (prior 0.3%) 9:45am: Markit US Services PMI, Nov. P, est. 54.8 (prior 54.8) \\n* * * \\nDB’s Jim Reid concludes the overnight wrap \\nGood luck to all those braving the sales today. It’s staggering to see the number of ‘How to Survive Black Friday’ articles out there now and how many more stories there are with tips and strategies to get the best bargains on the day. Apparently it now takes weeks of precise planning and preparation. It sounds like you’ll need a decent plate of leftover turkey this morning to build up the energy first. \\nIf the last 24 hours is anything to go by then it’s likely to be another fairly quiet day ahead with the US scheduled for an early close. While there wasn’t much to shout about in markets yesterday the most interesting story concerned a Bloomberg report about the ECB possibly putting off decisions about the future of its bond-buying program until next year. The crux of the story concerned the parameters of the program and how the technical issues relating to bond scarcity may have eased with the recent rise in yields. The story also suggested that ‘some’ policy makers would consider a delay on the QE extension decision but we’d also caveat that with the mention of ‘most’ policymakers still seeing a need to send a dovish message at next month’s meeting given the inflation outlook. Indeed we’d highlight that the recent message from ECB officials has been just that including President Draghi’s recent comments. A reminder too that the 2019 staff forecasts will be available for the first time at the meeting next month. That said, it is worth noting that expectations were fairly high for a QE announcement in December 2014 and we had to wait for January 2015 for the decision to eventually be made so you can’t entirely rule out the possibility a delay. \\nWith that Bloomberg report coming as markets in Europe closed we didn’t get to see too much of a reaction. 10y Bund yields finished little changed at 0.251% with yields, if anything, a couple of basis points higher following the story. The periphery was a bit more mixed (Portugal and Spain 1bp lower and Italy 1bp higher) but again moves were fairly modest. This morning we’ve seen 10y Treasury yields rise nearly 5bps however. There was also some focus on FX markets yesterday with a number of EM currencies making new recent lows including currencies in India, Malaysia, Vietnam and Philippines. The Turkish Lira (-1.44%) was also under pressure despite Turkey’s central bank raising rates for the first time in nearly three years. Following that though the European Parliament then voted overwhelmingly in favour of suspending EU membership talks with Turkey. \\nElsewhere, equity markets in Europe yesterday were generally a touch firmer despite volumes some 50% or so below the usual daily average The Stoxx 600 closed up +0.31% as healthcare and tech stocks led the move higher, while credit indices were marginally tighter. A bit of stability in the Oil complex seemingly helped too with WTI continuing to hover around the $48/bbl level ahead of the OPEC meeting next week. \\nBack to the ECB, Vice-President Constancio also added to the recent chorus of dovish communication from the Bank yesterday. He said that ‘we want our policies, including unconventional policies, in place until we are convinced there is a sustained path toward our objective of inflation’. The ECB’s twice-yearly Financial Stability Review was also released yesterday with the report warning about the risk of a possible abrupt global correction on the back of political uncertainty and elevated geopolitical tensions which is posing risks to stability, banks, confidence and economic growth. \\nThis morning in Asia, with the exception of China it’s been a broadly positive session for equity markets. The Nikkei (+0.77%), Hang Seng (+0.38%), Kospi (+0.10%) and ASX (+0.62%) are all up although in China the Shanghai Comp (-0.43%) has dipped lower. US equity index futures are also a smidgen higher while sovereign bond markets are generally weaker. 10y JGB yields in particular are a couple of basis points higher at 0.053% and the highest yield since mid-February. The Yen (-0.25%) however is under pressure and approaching ¥114 following the latest leg higher for the Dollar. The latest CPI data was also out in Japan overnight. The good news is that headline CPI return to positive territory at +0.1% yoy versus -0.5% in September, however the core remains rooted in deflation at -0.4% yoy (from -0.5%). The core-core did also improve to +0.2% yoy from 0.0%. Our economists noted that the increase in overall CPI was mainly due to a sharp increase in the price of fresh vegetables due to unfavourable weather. \\nThe only other snippet to mention from yesterday was the economic data. The most significant came from Germany where there was no final revisions made to the Q3 GDP print of +0.2% qoq, leaving the YoY rate at +1.7%. The components of the report showed that growth mainly came from domestic demand, especially private and government consumption. Meanwhile Germany’s November IFO survey revealed a business climate reading of 110.4 which was unchanged from the month prior. A slight increase in the current assessment component was offset by a modest decline in expectations. In France business confidence was also unchanged in November at 102. \\nLooking at today’s calendar the main focus this morning in the European session will likely be on the UK where we’ll get the second estimate of Q3 GDP and where the Office for National Statistics is expected to confirm that GDP grew at +0.5% qoq during the quarter. We’ll also receive the wider components of the GDP report which will be interesting to see. Also due out in the UK today is the CBI’s Distributive Trades Survey for November while French consumer confidence data is the early print this morning. Markets in the US should be quiet again today but there is some data due out including the remaining flash November PMI’s (services and composite), wholesale inventories and the advance goods trade balance for October. It’ll also be worth keeping an eye on any retail sales data for Black Friday sales in the US. \\nA quick reminder before we sign off that this Sunday, the second and final round of the French centre-right primary is due to be held. As a reminder the run-off is between Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe, the former coming out on top in the first round, with the winner going on to be the chosen Republican candidate. We should know the winner around 9pm GMT on Sunday evening. Related '],\n",
       " ['American Indian group mocks racist sports mascots in the most brilliant way',\n",
       "  'Zach Cartwright | November 6, 2016 \\nA prominent Native American association is making a powerful statement about offensive sports team logos using indigenous people as mascots. \\nThe National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), which is behind the effort to change the names and logos of the Washington Redskins football team and the Cleveland Indians baseball team, is circulating a purposefully offensive image using other ethnicities as mascots to promote dialogue about the inappropriateness of having an ethnic stereotype as the face of a team. \\nIn a poster made by the NCAI, several imaginary sports teams — the New York Jews, the San Francisco Chinamen, and the actual Cleveland Indians are all seen side-by-side. The “New York Jews” mascot is a hook-nosed, bespectacled grinning face, the “San Francisco Chinamen” logo is a buck-toothed Chinese stereotype in a traditional sedge hat, and the Cleveland Indians logo is depicted next to the other two offensive images. \\nThe evolution of offensive portrayals of Native Americans is nothing new in sports. As Indian County Today Media Network’s Vincent Schilling reported, Chief Wahoo — the mascot of the Cleveland Indians — goes back to 1928, when the team used various depictions of a Native American man in traditional headdress for its official team logo. Between 1947 and 1951, Chief Wahoo had yellow skin. After a body was added to Chief Wahoo, the mascot’s skin color was changed to a deep crimson. The Chief Wahoo known by baseball fans today has been the Cleveland Indians’ logo since 1972. \\nAs the NFL season continues, pressure is increasing on the Washington Redskins to change their name and mascot, after years of pressure from indigenous groups. An op-ed posted on ESPN in 2015 argued a change in the team’s name is “ inevitable ,” saying team owner Daniel Snyder is clinging to the past. Author Mike Wise cited the example of NFL referee Mike Carey, who asked the league to not assign him to Washington Redskins games for the final years of his career, saying he didn’t want to take part in disrespecting Native Americans. \\nSports fans are pushing the change the names of the teams through online petitions. A MoveOn.org petition asking the Redskins to change their name has garnered nearly 8,000 signatures as of this writing, and a Change.org petition to Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan asking the team to retire the Chief Wahoo logo has nearly 14,000 signatures. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

       " ['The Destruction of Reason in West',\n",
       "  'Dublin, Ireland.\\nThe West is feeling more and more like an irrational maze. The banks are mad. The austerity too. But the anti-Russia hysteria is the final straw. It’s not just “anti-Russia”: it’s anti-truth, anti-rational and anti-modern. It’s the end result of postmodernism. What began as irony is now systematic madness.\\nEverything is upside down. Or maybe at last it’s the right side up. Maybe the West to begin with never was the Free World. Wasn’t that the whole point of modernism? Modernism was self criticism. Modernism was critical of the West. And then along came postmodernism. And the West suddenly was off the hook. The West wearing the clothes of postmodernism went on the attack again.\\nThe end result is that anything goes as long as the West wins. Forget the truth. Forget the facts. And forget history. Everything apparently is fiction. The West can say what it wants because everything is interpretation. That’s the beauty of postmodernism. You can contradict yourself a million times and laugh it all off. As long as you’ve the power. And that’s the key word: power. Because postmodernism was from the word go a political project. One that was made in the West for the West.\\nThe end result is hatred for Russia. And love for “Al-Qaeda”. Why? Because Russia attempted to rationalise the world. It attempted to apply reason to the 21st century. And so the irrational West had to punish it. Listen to Putin in 2007 when he spoke in Munich:\\n“However, what is a unipolar world? However one might embellish this term, at the end of the day it refers to one type of situation, namely one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making.\\nIt is [a] world in which there is one master, one sovereign. And at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system, but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within.\\nAnd this certainly has nothing in common with democracy. Because, as you know, democracy is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minority.\\nIncidentally, Russia – we – are constantly being taught about democracy. But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves.\\nI consider that the unipolar model is not only unacceptable but also impossible in today’s world. And this is not only because if there was individual leadership in today’s – and precisely in today’s – world, then the military, political and economic resources would not suffice. What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilisation.”\\nAnd listen to him in New York in 2015 when he spoke in the UN General Assembly:\\n“ and so the export of revolutions, this time of so-called democratic ones, continues. It would suffice to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, as has been mentioned by previous speakers. Certainly political and social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time, and people there wish for changes naturally.\\nBut how did it actually turn out? Rather than bringing about reforms, an aggressive foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and the lifestyle itself. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster. Nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.\\nI cannot help asking those who have caused the situation, do you realize now what you’ve done?”\\nDid you hear the plea for reason? Did you hear the cry for modernity? Did you hear the demand for “moral foundations” – for universal values – for international law? Did you hear the defence of national sovereignty and the defence of the UN Charter? The West didn’t. In these two key Russian speeches (Munich ’07 and New York ’15) the West only heard a threat to it’s power.\\nThe West’s reply to Russia’s rationalism was and continues to be irrationalism. Media madness, “Presidential” paranoia and Islamic insanity is the West’s response to the truth. And the truth is no secret. But the West just shrugs it’s shoulders and laughs it all off. The truth is Western imperialism: the unipolar world, full spectrum dominance, neo-con mendacity, hybrid warfare, sanctions, speculation, special forces, the CIA, fundamentalism and American Exceptionalism. In short: Putin hit the nail on the head.\\nAnd the West hit back. Why? Because the West can’t defend itself rationally. There is no good reason for all the wealth found in the West. So there can only be a bad reason: imperial power. And modernism proved beyond doubt that it was bad. However as this power was rolled back in modern times – as the victims of Empire succeeded in liberating themselves – postmodern times came to the rescue of the West. In Nietzsche the West found it’s champion. The will to power was the West’s trump card. And with Nietzsche’s blessing it played it.\\nFor Nietzsche all that mattered was power. And whoever had it needed no justification or reason. Truth was a lie. And morality was only for the weak. However if this intellectual climate only emerged and became hegemonic in the late 1970s (think of Reagan and Thatcher) it of course was ever present behind the scenes in the dark corners of Western imperialism. For instance: America’s leading strategist (and Russian “expert”) after World War Two, George F. Kennan, famously put it into words in Memo PPS23 (1948):\\n“We have about 50% of the world’s wealth but only 6.3% of its population….Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships, which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality….We should cease to talk about vague….unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratisation. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.”\\nNietzsche could not have said it better himself. The question is though: has this elite Western approach to the world changed since Kennan wrote Memo PPS23? No – it has only become more crass. As a result this Nietzschean worldview is what Russia is up against today. But haven’t we seen this before? Hasn’t Nietzsche in another guise attacked Russia already? Have not the forces of irrationalism invaded Russia before? And did Russia not for our benefit defeat those forces of irrationalism? We still owe Russia.\\nSo let’s support it today it by burying Nietzsche. And by resurrecting universal reason and all the ideals which are built upon it. Give modern secular life another chance. Not just in Syria but in the West too.\\n Aidan O’Brien is a hospital worker in Dublin, Ireland.'],\n",

       "  'sport , 2018 world cup , RBTH Daily \"I must say that Zabivaka the wolf has been my mascot at university and at work for the last 15 years. I\\'m happy that now he will help Russian sport!\" Photo: The official mascot of the FIFA World Cup 2018 Wolf Zabivaka. Source: TASS \\nRussians have voted for the mascot for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with the winner being declared \\na wolf called Zabivaka, who wears the national tricolor and goggles and swings his paw at the ball. He will soon appear on all soccer and soccer-related paraphernalia and merchandise for the upcoming tournament. \\nThe other finalists were a tiger and a cat, but popular opinion was not in their favor and the wolf ran off with 53 percent of the votes (the tiger cosmonaut received 27 percent and the cat 20 percent). \\nA total of 50,000 participants and their mascots – from an Amur Tiger to an alien – battled for victory. However, in the end Russians decided that an animal that howls at the moon suits them best. For some the wolf is associated with speed and assertiveness, for others the chimerical chances of the national team winning the cup. \\nHowever, the new mascot has opened something of a Pandora\\'s box. Following the popular vote, the Russian internet has been inundated with quibbles and for several days Zabivaka was beset with unflattering comparisons from social network users who mocked the mascot\\'s physical appearance and name. Goalscorer, hooligan or loafer? \\n\"Yesterday they decided to play a joke: They proposed to call the mascot Zabivaka. And the people? The people accepted it,\" joked a tweet on the official Kontinental Hockey League Twitter account . \\nMany internet users noticed the ambiguity of the name – the verb zabivat in Russian can mean either to score (a goal) or to strike. This was ironic since former Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the name was just supposed to translate well and be original (for patenting purposes). Bear necessity: Designing a mascot for the 1980 Moscow Olympics \\n\"Something tells me that Zabivaka, written with Latin letters, does not make its etymology and meaning any easier for our English-language friends,\" wrote Twitter user @Bobchensk. \\nHowever, social network users remembered that football inspires some to strike not only the ball: The photographs of aggressive football fans in Marseilles, France during the 2016 European Championship, when the Russian national team was almost expelled from the tournament, appeared all over the internet once again, while others showed Zabivaka among thugs attacking their victims. \\nAnother unfortunate association with the infinitive zabivat is the related construction zabit na , which means to be indifferent, or not to care. Social network users took advantage of this opportunity to make fun of the woeful results of the Russian national team in recent years. Here the poor wolf really took a beating. \"Football and the Russian lifestyle,\" wrote @ntnet, while @SashaBo4alova noted that the best Zabivaka in Russian football is not a wolf but “a loafer.” \\n\"I must say that Zabivaka the wolf has been my mascot at university and at work for the last 15 years. I\\'m happy that now he will help Russian sport!\" wrote Facebook user Sergei Fokin on his page. A cheap wolf \\nThe wolf\\'s appearance also raised some issues. The main problem was addressed by @Maxi_Sar: \"Why the hell does the wolf need damned winter goggles if it’s a football world cup?!\" \\nRBTH posed this question to the creator of the new World Cup mascot Yekaterina Bocharova, a 21-year-old graphic design student at Tomsk State University. \\n\"These are not winter goggles but just sports goggles, like the ones you use for cycling. It\\'s just that Zabivaka is so fast on the field that he needs eye protection,\" she replied, adding that the goggles were also high-tech, for precise passes and strikes. Cheburashka: Fun facts about Russia\\'s iconic furry character \\nBocharova said that she was always fascinated by Disney cartoons, that she dreams of working for this company and loves the animated film Ratatouille . Incredibly, FIFA paid her just $500 for the rights to the drawing. \\nJournalists remarked (in Russian) that this was a tiny amount, noting that previous mascots cost much more. For example, the symbol of the Brazilian World Cup was Fuleko the armadillo and FIFA paid $100 million for his rights. The 1998 World Cup mascot Footix the rooster cost FIFA $30 million. \\nFIFA then earns revenues from using the mascots on souvenir products. Footix brought the organization $27 million, while Zakumi the leopard, the mascot for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, earned FIFA $71 million. \\nBut Bocharova has no issues with her compensation. She says that FIFA gave her \"a lot more,\" and it has nothing to do with money. \\n\"All these positive feelings and meetings with amazing people. I think money can\\'t buy all that,\" she said, implying her meetings with the Tomsk governor and the popular TV host Ivan Urgant, who invited Bocharova onto his talk show in Moscow. \"I would have not achieved all this without them. I am very happy and grateful for all this,\" she said. Subscribe to get the hand picked best stories every week Subscribe to our mailing list Facebook '],\n",

By: Ben Shapiro November 18, 2016 \\nThe media, desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming Trump administration as dangerously incompetent, are once again overplaying their hands. Instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that Trump relies heavily on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka – he invited them to a state meeting with Japan – they’re trying to claim that he just isn’t moving fast enough on appointments. \\nThat’s nuts. \\nBarack Obama didn’t name his picks for Secretary of State, Defense, or Attorney General until December 1, nearly a month after the November 4, 2008 election. George W. Bush didn’t name his picks for State, Defense, or Attorney General until mid-December (December 16 for Colin Powell, December 28 for Donald Rumsfeld, December 22 for John Ashcroft). Bill Clinton didn’t name his picks for those positions until at least December 22. George H.W. Bush was the fastest off the mark – he named James Baker Secretary of State the day after the November 8 election. Ronald Reagan waited until December 11 to get started; Jimmy Carter waited until December 3. \\nWe’re still waiting on Trump’s State and Defense picks, but he’s already out of the gate with Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. It’s November 17. \\nThe media are so eager to bury Trump’s administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so. Instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks – Steve Bannon, for example, is a rotten pick , but not because he’s a racist or anti-Semite – the media keep proclaiming THE END IS NEAR. This sort of alarmism doesn’t convince Americans, who don’t really see why there’s any giant rush to appoint people who aren’t going to be formally considered by the Senate until January 20 anyway. \\nIf this election was about repudiation of the media – and it was – the media aren’t doing themselves any favors when they promulgate fact-free narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets “fake news.” For years, Americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day. Each day, the media seem determined to prove them right. Tags \"],\n",

Government income increases through tax collection. But we also need diverse programs to observe and monitor the black money deposits of big fish in foreign banks and control criminal networks sponsored by alternative money exchanges and banking methods in foreign countries. In addition, there should be strict observation and monitoring of multilevel chain network marketing companies under the corporate umbrella. \\nEnemy countries are utilizing international criminal networks to destabilize the Indian economy through printing and circulating large amounts of counterfeits across borders and transporting counterfeits by air and sea through improper channels and criminal organizations. But they are using religions like Islam and Islamic symbols for their tasks. Real Muslims don’t help the criminal networks to propagate terrorism in india. \\nControlling the criminal networks throughout India by specially trained forces is the best option for strengthening the Indian economy. The digitalization of data and wealth under the American imperialists and the trade and investment bonds connected to foreign share markets can badly affect the Indian economy when a sudden crisis occurs. India should change its economic policy from a liberal and globalist point of view and seek another alternative, an independent Indian economic policy which can help India develop and become a superpower with a sustainable economy. \\nTraditional forms of transactions made in certain sections of Indian ethical society should be protected through strict monitoring. Opportunities should be opened for Muslim communities to operate with real Islamic banking under government control which can invite large amounts of investments from Muslims who fear mortgage-based banking programs that are not suitable for them. This fear factor is utilized by criminal networks, black marketers, anti-nationals, and other enemies who wish to destroy the Indian economy. The economic ideology of different political parties in India is different, so the liberal, globalist, digital economic code may not be received by all communities in India. \\nDigital banking robbery conducted by international criminals world wide poses a real threat. Strict monitoring by the government and new alternatives are very urgent in this moment. The weakness of the Indian opposition is celebrated by the Indian right wing and invites Indians to embrace patriotism. Indians wish to become independent from foreign economic interventions. Economic emergencies are also a test for Indian citizens on the right. Related links '],\n",

       "  'Ben Shapiro Destroys John Oliver On Abortion And Trump By: Hank Berrien October 27, 2016 \\nOn Thursday, on his daily podcast, Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro decimated HBO host and supposed comedian John Oliver for his comments regarding Donald Trump\\'s comments on abortion during the third presidential debate. \\nShapiro began, \"HBO’s John Oliver belongs to a class of British people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent. They think that because they share an accent with Rex Harrison from My Fair Lady this makes them geniuses.\" \\nHe continued: \\nSo John Oliver does a political show on American politics; he doesn’t know much about American politics; he doesn’t know much about politics generally; but he’s been feted by the media because he’s a comedian who’s wildly to the left. So just like President Obama is going to be interviewed by Samantha Bee, who is legitimately the least funny person in human history, (she and Trevor Noah actually have a cage match next week to determine who’s the least funny person in human history. Both of them I believe, beat Stalin for that title a while back, so now were going to unify the championships), so Obama’s going to be on with Samantha Bee, where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortion’s wonderful. \\nJohn Oliver was ripping on Donald Trump the other day at some awards ceremony, and because he’s British, that means we’re supposed to pay attention to him, even though we fought a revolution so we wouldn’t have to pay attention to the Brits. Here’s John Oliver talking about abortion: \\nThe screen then showed Oliver pontificating: \\nIn terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important; we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of late-term abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work, no clear understanding of the basic biology of women’s bodies, and a very poor sense of grammar as well. So I guess we got, in a sense, what we were asking for. If you ask Donald Trump to draw a Fallopian tube, I cannot imagine what you would get back other than a child’s drawing of a cobra. \\nShapiro fired back: \\nOkay. I would hesitate to ask John Oliver to draw a Fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here, because he obviously doesn’t know. Now look, I criticized Trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasn’t graphic enough. But let me, for those who missed it, explain what exactly happens in a late-term abortion, which is what he was talking about, okay? What happens in a late-term abortion, what happens in a late-term abortion, is something completely awful; this is according to americanpregnancy.org., okay? Not a right-wing pro-life website: americanpregnancy.org: \"The fetus is rotated; forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs, shoulders and arms through the birth canal. A small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside. The catheter removes the cerebral material,” that would be the brains, “until the skull collapses. The fetus is then completely removed.” \\nShapiro continued to explain the barbaric procedure: \\nOkay, that’s one procedure that’s used; that’s “dilation and extraction.” In late-term abortions it usually one of these two; “dilation and evacuation” or “dilation and extraction.” “Dilation and evacuation”: The baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it; sometimes they don’t use such injections; then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the child’s body in the womb, and remove it piece by piece. \\nThen he proceeded to carve up Oliver: \\nSo I guess that Donald Trump could have been more graphic; I don’t know that John Oliver would have enjoyed that, but he could have been more graphic, I suppose. But this is what they do, laugh it up, “Oh, he can’t draw a Fallopian tube.\" \\nOkay, John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let’s see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. It’s not waving a magic wand, and it’s not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing. I want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb. I would like to see that. \"Okay, John: draw an abortion. Really. Draw it; let’s see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like.\" Ben Shapiro \\nShapiro concluded: \\nBut of course he’ll never do that, other than, \"It might look like a cobra; it might look like a cobra; maybe it’ll look like a princess, waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina.” The fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to child-killing is absolutely ridiculous and despicable. \\nVideo below: '],\n",

As a way to project strength, Obama and Hillary continue to blame Putin for cyber attacks and the WikiLeaks releases. Putin Will No Longer Allow Obama And Hillary To Disrespect Russia \\nOn October 21, Putin issued a global message that if Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama continue to slander Russia, he was going to shoot down U.S. jets in the Middle East and begin to prepare for World War III. \\nTwo days after that, Putin ordered the Russian Defense Ministry to begin training and managing all local authorities, law enforcement, and state security as they are preparing for a nuclear war with the United States. \\nAnd with the United States at the eve of war, Hillary Clinton continues to prance around calling Putin a “thug puppet.” \\nPutin has now made his third move following Clintons comments, and he has brought Russian ally China into the fight. China is now sending a plethora of resources to the Middle East to assist Russia is pushing Obama and the United States out. \\nNow the country is openly declaring its support to the Syrian government, which has become the bone of contention between the United States and Russia. The United States wants the Syrian government out, while Russia wants it to stay. \\nThe People’s Republic of China has announced that it will provide both military and humanitarian aid to the Syrian government, in order to help them fight the rebels trying to overthrow the regime. China Preparing For WWIII As Russia’s Ally \\nThe Chinese have dispatched dozens of top military advisers to strengthen the Syrian army against Obama and the terrorist groups he continues to arm in order to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \\nChinese officials argue that they wanted to stay out of the Russia/U.S. conflict but Obama’s actions have given them no choice. \\nChinese officials argue that in 2015, they chose not to join the efforts in the Middle East. They argued that they would give Obama the opportunity to defeat ISIS and restore democracy in the Middle East. \\nSince then, Obama has allowed ISIS to eclipse 50,000 fighters, they operate in more than 32 countries, a refugee crisis has sent more than 10,000,000 refugees all over the world, and now Obama wants to overthrow the Syrian regime–which would leave no one left to stop ISIS from controlling more territory. \\nChinese officials argue, “Obama has done this to himself, and he better not play with fire.” \\nThat is a direct threat from China to the United States. \\nThings have gotten so bad under Obama that China and Russia are now joining forces to kick the United States out of the Middle East and are promising World War III if our leaders do not stop disgracing them publicly. \\nWho can blame China for joining forces with Russia? If Obama’s actions are leading us down a path to war with Russia and China, imagine how bad it will get it Hillary wins this election. \\nA President Clinton worries Russia and China so badly that they are now preparing for nuclear war.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but you’d never know it given the ridiculous display by the Obamas on the campaign trail. Fortunately, a pro-Donald Trump super PAC decided to remind America… and Hillary Clinton is not too happy about it. \\nBuzzfeed reported : \\nThe Clinton campaign has sent cease and desist letters to at least four local television stations in Florida demanding they stop running an ad paid for by a pro-Trump Super PAC featuring First Lady Michelle Obama — even as the PAC is expanding its ad campaign in North Carolina. \\nThe ad, titled “Can’t Run Her House,” is being run through the Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC, a subsidiary of the Make America Number 1 PAC, which is backing Trump’s campaign. \\nDuring the 2008 presidential primary campaign, Michelle Obama said: \\nOne of the important aspects of this race is role-modeling what good families should look like. And my view is, if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House. You can’t do it. \\nBarack Obama laughably claimed that the comment wasn’t about Clinton, but who else would it have been about? That’s what liberals do, though; they just deny something ever happened or wasn’t what it obviously was — and thanks to the biased mainstream media, they get away with it. \\nHogan Gidley, the PAC’s spokesperson, said of the legal move by the Clinton campaign: \\nHillary’s just angry because the ad is impactful, it’s working and it speaks directly to the women she’s been trying to con for years. Hillary’s own campaign said when Michelle Obama speaks out, “it has a real impact,” and indeed, we agree – because it was Mrs. Obama who correctly pointed out Hillary Clinton “certainly can’t run the White House.” \\nTake a look at the ad below: \\nYou know, it really seems as if most Democrats are unable to just tell the truth. It looks pretty ridiculous for the Obamas to glowingly support Clinton and for Clinton to speak glowingly about the Obamas after the things they all said back in 2008. \\nPart of the problem with Democrats is that they have the media in the tank for them, so they don’t have to own up to anything. Besides, it’s not like their moral compass, the ones that actually have one, would force them to do so. \\nFor the Clinton camp to resort to legal action over an ad that simply points out their hypocrisy is the height of absurdity.

Catholic Church announces a major warning against Hillary Heisenberg 5 mins ago News Comments Off on Yikes! Catholic Church announces a major warning against Hillary \\nA San Diego Catholic Church claims Hillary is doing the devils work. Reuters reported: A Roman Catholic church in San Diego told its parishioners the devil works through politicians like Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and warned that voting for Democrats is a “mortal sin,” according to local media and the church’s website. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Old Town made the statements in its weekly leaflet to churchgoers, a copy of which remains on the church’s website. The letter railed against issues like abortion and constraints on tax-exempt organizations from certain political activity, likening them to slavery. “Satan has deceived many Christians to convert to worldly values from Christian ones,” the Oct. 30 bulletin reads. “The devil does this through the tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton has stated, ‘And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,’ to draw us away from God’s teachings.” '],\n",

American national security is our government’s first and foremost responsibility, then the economy – those two issues really are paramount to any American,” Miami chapter president Vincent Foster told the Washington Examiner on Monday evening. \\n“Our membership has gotten behind the Republican national nominee and it’s unfortunate that other Republicans are unable to do so. Regardless of differences, we understand that a Hillary Clinton presidency is only going to be detrimental to the LGBT community and the general American population.” \\nLCR announced on Oct. 22 that it would not support Trump despite his being “perhaps the most pro-LGBT presidential nominee in the history of the Republican Party” because he has “concurrently surrounded himself with senior advisers with a record of opposing LGBT equality.” \\nFoster said the national organization’s decision was a “big surprise” and prompted the South Florida chapter to re-evaluate the matter. On Oct. 26, the 20 members of Miami LCR unanimously voted to endorse Trump. \\nThe Miami chapter has had a long-standing relationship with Trump, Foster explained. The billionaire businessman’s campaign initially reached out to the group months ago to work together in the battleground state. Foster added the campaign attended the group’s Lincoln Day dinner and has been fully supportive of them. \\n“To have a Republican presidential nominee who cares so much, especially after Orlando – that resonated so much,” Foster said. \\nAlthough LCR typically does not allow local chapters to support other candidates, the organization is allowing for flexibility in this election. The Washington, D.C.-based national group is permitting regional chapters to endorse or not endorse Trump in this election. \\nLog Cabin Republicans in Cleveland, Los Angeles, Orange County, Texas and Georgia have also endorsed Trump, according to Angelo.

       "  'Frank Camp November 13, 2016 \\nDuring an interview with Lesley Stahl for 60 Minutes , which will air in its entirety Sunday night, Donald Trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants: \\n\"We are getting them out of our country,\" the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records. \"After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we\\'re going to make a determination on the people you\\'re talking about who are terrific people, they\\'re terrific people who we\\'re going to make a determination on, but before we make a determination, we want to secure our border.\" \\nGasp. \\nDonald Trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration. Throughout the primary process, he promised a \" deportation force ,\" telling MSNBC\\'s Mika Brzezinski in November 2015: \\n\"You\\'re going to have a deportation force, and you\\'re going to do it humanely. Don\\'t forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and they\\'re waiting to come in legally. And I always say the wall, we\\'re going to build the wall. It\\'s going to be a real deal. It\\'s going to be a real wall.\" \\nIn August, Trump delivered a major immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he softened his stance a bit, focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes: \\n\"Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice.\" \\nHe then added that \"anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don’t have a country.\" \\nDuring the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Trump reiterated his position against amnesty: \\n\"Well, first of all, [Clinton] wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders.\" \\nFor Trump diehards, these statements were enough. Their guy was going to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, and no one would tell them otherwise. However, as anyone with access to Google should know, the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion. \\nIn July 2015, Donald Trump told CNN\\'s Dana Bash: \\n\"I would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legal…A lot of these people are helping us…and sometimes it’s jobs a citizen of the United States doesn’t want to do. I want to move ’em out, and we’re going to move ’em back in and let them be legal.\" \\nWhat Trump was talking about is known as \"touchback amnesty.\" Such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants, but allow them an expedited means of returning to the United States in order to obtain legal status. In other words, they touch base in their home country, then come right back. \\nIn November 2015, Eric Trump repeated his father\\'s plan during an interview with Fox News\\' Megyn Kelly: \\n\"The point isn’t just deporting them, it’s deporting them and letting them back in legally. He’s been so clear about that and I know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it, but its deporting them and letting them back legally.\" \\nGoing back further, Trump\\'s support for amnesty is even more stark. Speaking on Fox & Friends in 2012, he said: \\n\"For people that have been here for years that have been hard-workers, have good jobs, they’re supporting their family–it’s very, very tough to just say ‘By the way, 22 years, you have to leave. Get out’…I’m one of the world’s very conservative people, but I have to tell you on a human basis, how do you throw somebody out that’s lived in this country for twenty years?\" \\nDuring the 2012 presidential election cycle, Trump even called Mitt Romney\\'s idea of self-deportation \" maniacal ,\" and remarked that Republican Party policy toward illegal immigrants was \" mean-spirited .\" \\nDonald Trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win. Now that he has won, he\\'s already backtracking on multiple campaign promises, from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to the deportation of illegal immigrants. Tags '],\n",

       "  '\\nSean Brown AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS – \\nWikileaks has revealed some rather troubling things about Hillary Clinton and her staffers, but perhaps the most disturbing, a bizarre, is the fact that John Podesta is involved with satanic rituals. \\nNo, this isn’t fiction and I’m not wearing tin foil on my head. An email released by Wikileaks reveals Podesta was invited to a “spirit cooking dinner” by performance artist Marina Abramovic, and you can rest assured that it’s not anything like it sounds. \\n“I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina,” an email dated June 28, 2015 read. \\nShortly after, the emails, which was sent to Podesta’s brother Tony, was forwarded to john with the message, “Are you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner.” \\nNow you’re probably wondering what all the fuss is about, and I seriously can’t blame you. So let’s turn to Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars for a little background on what this “spirit cooking” is really all about. \\nSpirit cooking refers to “a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley” and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”. \\nAccording to Marina Abramovic, if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. \\nThe video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the “recipe” for the “painting,” which is comprised of the words, “With a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.” \\nThe ceremony is, “meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism “As Above, So Below.” \\nBelow is a video of Abramovic conducting the satanic ritual: \\nHow creepy. Even creepier is the same woman holding a bloody goat’s head – a representation of the Satanist symbol Baphomet. The Podestas\\'\"Spirit Cooking\" dinner?It\\'s not what you think.It\\'s blood, sperm and breastmilk. \\n— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 \\nYeah… \\nIf you enjoyed this story, be sure to follow Sean Brown on Facebook , and check out his website, politicalcult.com . \\nGod Bless.

The former governor of Texas and ex-rival in the Republican primaries has been mentioned for a number of slots in Trump ‘s Cabinet, including the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, and Agriculture. \\nThe president also met with a fairly prominent Democrat: U.S. Rep.

A military veteran, Gabbard has been a vocal critic of VA medical services. \\nIn a statement released Monday Gabbard said “while the rules of political expediency would say I should have refused to meet with President-elect Trump , I never have and never will play politics with American and Syrian lives. \\n“President-elect Trump and I had a frank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth,” Gabbard said. “I shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country, and the world,” Gabbard continued. \\nAlso Monday Trump met with former Massachusetts senator Scott Brown. After the meeting Brown told reporters that he spoke with Trump about being head of the VA. \\n“He’s obviously going to take my application, or interest, under consideration. I’m glad that he called. He’s going to obviously meet other folks, and we should know, I would think, probably after Thanksgiving,” Brown said. “I think I’m the best person, but there are some tremendous people out there and I don’t look at it as a competition.” \\nTrump also met with Oklahoma Gov.

       "  'November 12, 2016 2703 German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said the US president-elect needs to understand NATO is more about values than business-like behavior. Share on Facebook \\nGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen is in panic mode. Her fear is that Trump may actually call out NATO’s uselessness…and that would mean Germany, and other NATO freeloaders, may actually have pay for their own security. \\nThat is why, when von der Leyen warns Trump to not even think about rapprochement with Russia, she is signaling her fear that such a rapprochement would mean the end of her and her war hungry cronies. \\nWhen von der Leyen tells Trump that NATO stood by the US after the 9/11 attacks, and that NATO “isn’t just a business,” she is trying to kiss Trump’s ass, and admitting that NATO is in fact a “business.” \\nAnd of course no NATO grand standing would be complete without the exhausted and fictional argument that NATO is actually useful in countering Moscow on Syria and Ukraine. \\nRT reports … \\nAppearing on the ZDF Thursday show ‘Maybrit Illner’, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen emotionally argued that the US president-elect needs to understand NATO is more about values than business-like behavior. \\nShe also went on to address some unfounded speculation circulating in Western capitals, namely that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are in a ‘bromance’ – a kind of relationship between the two leaders that would benefit bilateral ties between Moscow and Washington. \\nTherefore, the Defense Minister continued, the issues of the Ukrainian conflict and the ongoing anti-terrorist efforts in the Syrian city of Aleppo are not to be taken off the table during discussions with Moscow. \\nHere are some of von der Leyen remarks to Trump with regard to NATO… \\n“What his advisers will hopefully tell him and what he needs to learn is that NATO isn’t just a business. It’s not a company.” \\n“I don’t know how he values NATO.” \\n“You can’t say ‘the past doesn’t matter, the values we share don’t matter’ but instead try to get as much money out of [NATO] as possible and whether I can have a nice deal out of it,” \\n“Donald Trump has to say clearly on which side he is. Whether he is on the side of the law, peaceful order and democracy or whether he does not care about this and is looking instead for a best buddy.” \\nFor his part, Trump has been lukewarm on the whole NATO charade…and rightly so. RT reminds us of what Trump has said about NATO … \\nDuring his election campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly voiced skepticism towards the bloc, calling it “obsolete” in the era of fighting terrorism worldwide. \\n“Maybe NATO will dissolve and that’s OK, not the worst thing in the world,” he said earlier. \\nTrump, however, earlier dismissed claims he favors Putin both personally and as a political leader, saying on NBC in September: \\n“I don’t know him, I know nothing about him really. I just think if we got along with Russia that’s not a bad thing.” \\nTrump has also suggested that the US should not engage too much in defending European allies. \\n“Hey, NATO allies,” Trump wrote in a Facebook post in July, “If we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost of protecting you, I will tell you – congratulations, you will be defending yourself.” '],\n",

       "  \"Getty - Justin Sullivan The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \\nEarlier this week, Americans learned that Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's Super PAC, Common Good VA, donated $500K to Jill McCabe's senate run. \\nJill just so happens to be the wife of Andrew McCabe — the current Deputy Director of the FBI — who oversaw the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. \\nIf that wasn't enough to give you trust issues, it turns out that Hillary Clinton herself headlined a fundraiser for Common Good VA. The event took place in June of 2015, just one month before the FBI officially launched its investigation into Clinton's email server. \\nAccording to The Daily Mail , the fundraiser that Clinton helped spearhead raised over a million dollars. \\nClinton returned to Common Good in October of 2015 for another speech. That speech conveniently took place just one week before Jill McCabe received two donations, one on October 25th in the sum of $175,000 and the other on October 27th for $125,000. \\nIn addition, one of Common Good's biggest donors, James Bernard , gave the PAC $100,000 just three days before McCabe got her October donations. \\nThere's more. \\nBernard is a big Hillary supporter, too. In fact, he's listed on her site as a “Hillblazer,” someone recognized for raising or contributing $100K or more to the campaign. \\nYet, he's the not the only Hillblazer who donated to Common Good before McCabe was given her biggest campaign contribution. \\nIndependent Journal Review discovered that Louisa Cohlan also donated $100k to Common Good. Her $100k donation took place on Sept 30th of 2015, which was one day before McCabe received a $150,000 from the PAC. \\nCohlan has an interesting tie to the Clintons. In 2014 , Louisa and her husband Johnathan purchased a 4.1 million dollar vacation home that the Clinton family used while Bill was still president. 'Auction planned for home where Clinton family stayed during Skaneateles vacations' http://t.co/dsPxh4qkws #PLANY pic.twitter.com/8tkSMPVl9w \\nOther donors who contributed $100K to the PAC include: \\nSamuel Nappi, who is also a major Clinton Campaign donor and supporter. \\nThe late Mark Weiner , a good friend of Bill Clinton and major fundraiser for the Democrat Party. \\nAnd Robert L. Johnson, America's first African American billionaire who also donated $100K to the Clinton Campaign \\nHowever, the deep ties Hillary's campaign has to Common Good go even deeper than that. \\nThe Daily Mail's investigation revealed the ties Clinton's staff have to the PAC: \\nZuzenak, who oversaw the donations to Jill McCabe, left Common Good VA last May to join the Clinton campaign as its Virginia field director. \\nHe isn't alone in the move. Common Good VA's executive director Michael Halle also joined the Clinton campaign as battleground analytics director in the spring of 2015. \\nThe group's former fundraiser, Amanda McTyre, is now a finance director for Clinton, and staffer Marissa Astor left to become an assistant Clinton campaign manager. \\nAnd the cake-topper, Clinton's current campaign manager, Robby Mook, also worked for the PAC prior to the campaign role he has now. \\nOne thing is for certain: Such revelations will raise new questions about possible foul play and major conflict-of-interest surrounding Hillary's candidacy. Because with it all staring you in the face, everything seems all too convenient to just be a mere coincidence. \"],\n",

He wanted to meet face-to-face with Clinton during his trip to Ireland a few days later. \\nIn addition, McElearney asked Abedin if Clinton would meet with four others — two of whom were CGI sponsors. Abedin forwarded his request to Bill Clinton aides Doug Band, Jon Davidson, and Justin Cooper, and asked if they had ties to CGI: Image Credit: State Dept/Citizens United via The Daily Caller \\nAbedin asked Clinton\\'s aides: \\n“Are these legit CGI people? I know Denis O\\'Brian but not the others. Everyone is asking to see her.” \\nDavidson responded by confirming that two of the names on the list — O\\'Brian and Michael Carey — were connected to CGI, but that the other two names on the list were not. \\nAnother email obtained by Citizens United showed Bill Clinton aide Doug Band asking Abedin to invite an executive from the Dow Chemicals Japanese office (to whom both Band and Clinton were connected financially) to a State Department meeting between Hillary Clinton and the Japanese Prime Minister: Image Credit: State Department/Citizens United via The Daily Caller \\nThis is not the first time that Abedin has been implicated in Clinton\\'s alleged efforts to leverage her position in the State Department to the financial advantage of CGI. \\nJudicial Watch obtained a series of emails between Clinton aides Doug Band and Huma Abedin that detailed a number of times when people who donated or were connected to CGI were granted special or expedited access to Clinton while she served in the State Department. \\nAmong the most notable exchanges involved Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain, who had attempted access through normal channels and was denied. But Judicial Watch reported that everything changed once a donation was made: \\n\"Included among the Abedin-Band emails is an exchange revealing that when Crown Prince Salman of Bahrain requested a meeting with Secretary of State Clinton, he was forced to go through the Clinton Foundation for an appointment. \\nAbedin advised Band that when she went through \\'normal channels\\' at State, Clinton declined to meet. After Band intervened, however, the meeting was set up within forty-eight hours. \\nAccording to the Clinton Foundation website, in 2005, Salman committed to establishing the Crown Prince’s International Scholarship Program (CPISP) for the Clinton Global Initiative. And by 2010, it had contributed $32 million to CGI. \\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reportedly gave between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. And Bahrain Petroleum also gave an additional $25,000 to $50,000.\" \\nAbedin also revealed, in an email obtained by Wikileaks , a direct “pay-for-play” exchange involving CGI and the king of Morocco — just weeks after Clinton had announced her run for the presidency. Fox News reported on the link: \\n“Abedin wrote that \\'this was HRC\\'s idea\\' for her to speak at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in Morocco in May 2015 as an explicit condition for the $12 million commitment from the king.” \\nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook stalled and attempted to redirect when he was asked about this exchange in a recent interview with Fox News\\'s Chris Wallace.

The 1851 Treaty Camp was set up this past Sunday directly in the path of the pipeline, on land recently purchased by DAPL. Today this camp, a reclamation of unceded Dakota territory affirmed as part of the Standing Rock Reservation in the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851, was violently cleared. Both blockades established this past weekend to enable that occupation were also cleared. In addition to pepper spray and percussion grenades, shotguns were fired into the crowd with less lethal ammunition and a sound cannon was used (see images below). At least one person was tased and the barbed hook lodged in his face, just outside his eye.

       "  'INTERVIEW WITH THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD\\n“Syria is paying the price of its independence” by Bashar al-Assad Interviewed by the Cuban journalist Roberto Garcia on behalf of the agency Prensa Latina, the President of the Syrian Arab Republic highlights the cohesion between the different groups within Syrian society and popular participation in defense of the Nation. After noting that preserving national independence was a fundamental factor in the struggle that today is liberating the Syrian state, Bashar al-Assad recognizes the historical similarity between this battle and the recent struggles between Latin American nations.\\nVoltaire Network | Damascus (Syria) | 2 November 2016 Español President Bashar al-Assad receives the special envoy from Latina Prensa, Roberto García, 21 July 2016. Prensa Latina : Mr President, thank you very much for granting Prensa Latina this historic opportunity to communicate to the world your perspective on the situation in Syria given that, as you know, much information has been manipulated on the foreign aggression your country faces.\\nHow do you assess the current military situation in Syria and what are the main challenges that the Syrian armed forces on the ground face in their struggle against the anti-governmental groups? If possible, we would like your opinion on the current situation on the combat fronts in Aleppo and Homs.\\nBashar al-Assad :Obviously, the terrorists have received massive support from different corners of the world. There are more than 100 nationalities participating in the aggression against Syria, relying on the support of countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, that fund them and Turkey that undoubtedly offers them logistical support, as well as the approval and supervision of Western States led by the United States, France, the United Kingdon and other allies.\\nBut since the Russians decided to combat terrorism in Syria, essentially the Al-Nusra Front, the Islamic State (Daesh) and other groups associated to these two extremist entities, the balance of powers has now shifted in our favour and against these groups.\\nThe Syrian Arab Army has succeeded and continues to succeed in making advances in different parts of Syria and is determined to topple them.\\nThe situation in Homs, since the terrorists abandoned it more than a year ago, has improved and is far more stable now. There are some districts in the city infiltrated by extremists where a reconciliation process is now underway. On the basis of this reconciliation process, terrorists have the possibility of laying down their arms and then returning to their normal lives, benefitting from the governmental amnesty. Alternatively they leave Homs for another part of Syria, which is exactly what happened more than a year ago in the centre of this city.\\nBut the situation is different in Aleppo given than the Turks and their Saudi and Qatarian allies have lost many of their cards on the battle fields in Syria, so that Aleppo is its final card, especially for the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has tried his best with the Saudis to send there the largest possible number of terrorists that now totals around 5,000. This they did in the last two months, from Turkey to Aleppo in the hope of occupying this city, but they failed.\\nIn actual fact, our army has succeeded in making advances in Aleppo and the surroundings areas, seeking to find terrorists, then to negotiate with them so as to return them to their normal life. Alternatively they will abandon this zone, or in some other way will be destroyed because they have no other option.\\nPrensa Latina : What are the priorities of the Syrian armies in their struggle against the terrorist groups? What role do the popular defense groups play in the theatre of operations?\\nBashar al-Assad : The priority of the Arab Syrian Army is fighting Daesh [the Islamic Emirate], the al-Nusra Front and groups such as the Ahrar Al-Sham and Yeish al-Islam (the Islamic Army).\\nThese four groups are directly linked to al-Qaeda, given that they share its ideology. They are Islamic extremists that want to eliminate everything that is contrary to their way of thinking and that is not aligned to them.\\nRegarding the groups of popular defense, at the beginning of the conflicts, the terrorists unleashed a non-conventional war against our army that is a conventional organization, such as any other army in the world.\\nAs a consequence, the support that these groups of popular defense offered was of utmost importance to destroying the terrorists with non-conventional tactics. This has been a great help for the Syrian Arab Army given that the combatants of the popular defense fight in their own zones, cities and towns - places that they are very familiar with. I mean, they really dominate the roads, paths and geography of these zones and for this reason are a great help to the Syrian Arab Army. This is their mission.\\nPrensa Latina : How does the resistance of the Syrian people materialize against foreign aggression on the economic front? Which sectors in this sphere continue to function despite the war, the international sanctions and acts of sabotage?\\nBashar al-Assad :In actual fact, the war against Syria is integral because it is not limited to the support offered to the terrorists but furthermore unleashed a containment policy against our country at the international level…\\nThe third factor is the economy. They give orders to extremists and mercenary agents to destroy the infrastructure that grew the Syrian economy and satisfied the daily needs of its citizens.\\nAt the same time, they began to impose a direct embargo on the borders of our nation, making use of these irregular armed elements from abroad, harnessing the banking systems in the whole world.\\nDespite this, the Syrian people is determined to pursue a normal life, within the realms of what is possible. This situation has led to many businessmen, essentially medium and small industrials, abandoning the most unstable conflict zones and making their way to other areas where there is greater stability. There they establish their businesses at much-reduced levels, as a way of continuing to exist, to maintain economic activity and to continue to satisfy our citizens’ needs.\\nIn this context, most sectors are still functioning. For example, the pharmaceutical industry is working at more than 60% of its manufacturing capacity and this is very important for our economy in the circumstances that we are going through.\\nI think that despite our current situation, we are not cutting back on the efforts to broaden once again our economic base, especially following the advances that the Syrian Arab Army is making in different zones of combat.\\nPrensa Latina : Mr President: let us speak a little about the international environment. What is your opinion on the role the UN is playing in the Syrian conflict and the attempts of Washington and its allies to impose their will on the Security Council and the Geneva Talks?\\nBashar al-Assad :Talking about the role of the UN and the Security Council could be ambiguous and confusing given that in actual fact, the United Nations is an instrument that the United States can use to suit its needs.\\nWashington is able to impose on the [UN] its norms of double standards thereby preventing the organization acting according to the provisions of the UN Charter. They can use it just as they do with any other institution under US administration.\\nWere it not for the positions taken by Russia and China on certain causes, the UN would be a wholly US institution. But Russia and China have achieved a certain equilibrium in these institutions over the last 5 years, especially on the Syrian cause.\\nBut if you wish to speak of the role of the UN through its mediators and its envoys, such as Mr Staffan De Mistura most recently and before him Koffi Anan, Lakdar Brahimi and others, we can say that these mediators are not independent.\\nThese officials reflect the pressures that Western countries exercise, or, in some cases, the dialogue existing between the main powers, principally Russia and the United States. They are not stable and due to this, you cannot speak of the UN playing a role.\\nIt is a reflection of this equilibrium. So, the UN is not playing a role in the Syrian Conflict. There is only US – Russian dialogue and we know that the Russians are not cutting back on their efforts and that they are working with all sincerity and honesty to topple the terrorists.\\nHowever, the US is manoeuvring to use the terrorists rather than to destroy them.\\nPrensa Latina : Mr President: How do you currently see the co-existence between Syrian ethnic and religious groups in relation to this foreign interference? How does this factor impact the current economic climate?\\nBashar al-Assad :The most important matter with respect to this harmony between the different components of the Syrian social fabric, is that it is true and authentic. This is because it has been constructed throughout History and throughout the centuries. This means in this sort of conflict it is impossible to destroy this social fabric.\\nIf you take a tour in the different zones under government control, you can see all the colours of the social fabric of Syrian society living together.\\nI can add that during the conflict, this harmony improved and was further strengthened. This is not just words - it is a reality that has different reasons. The conflict is a lesson and this diversity that characterizes a society can enrich the country or can be converted into a problem. There is no other outcome.\\nThe people have learnt that we have to work very hard to retain this harmony given that the first argument that the terrorists and their allies in the region and in the West used in relation to the conflict in Syria was of a sectarian character.\\nThey would like to divide the people so that they will fight among themselves with the aim of stoking the fire in Syria but they have failed. The Syrians learnt the lesson how to live in harmony and they were enjoying this harmony before the conflict exploded. Now we have to try to strengthen it.\\nAnd for this reason, without any exaggeration, I can say that where this issue is concerned, all is well.\\nWe can also say that the situation is different in the areas under terrorist control. As you know, those that belong fundamentally to the extremist factions associated with al-Qaeda have not decreased their efforts to introduce their oscurantist ideology into the minds of the new generation, an ideology that asserts death, decapitation and all these horrendous practices. And that had success in some areas.\\nWith the passage of time, it will be more difficult to deal with this new generation of youth, saturated with the doctrine and ideology of Wahabism and al-Qaeda. Here is based the only danger that our society will face in relation to the harmony and coexistence to which you have referred.\\nPrensa Latina : Mr President, let us return to the international scene. What is your opinion on the role that the US-led coalition plays in relation to the groups deployed in the North of Syria, especially the Kurds?\\nBashar al-Assad :As you know, when the US administrations build relations with any group or society in a country, it is not for the benefit of that nation or its people but because it serves the US agenda.\\nConsequently, we have to ask ourselves: why are the Americans supporting someone in Syria? Clearly they are not doing it for the benefit of Syria, but because they have their own agenda. And this US agenda in all countries always aims at dividing.\\nThey do not work to unite people, but to divide them. Sometimes they choose a sectarian group and at other times an ethnic group and lend its support against other ethnic groups or wedge a distance between it and other components of society. That is its agenda.\\nTherefore it is evident that all this US support has nothing to do with Daesh, nor with al-Nusra, nor even with the fight against terrorism as from the time the US intervened, Daesh has grown. It only started to shrink when Russia lent its support to the Syrian Army last September.\\nPrensa Latina : Mr President, what is your opinion of the attempted coup that recently took place in Turkey? How do you think it affects the current situation in this country, at the international level and also the conflict in Syria?\\nBashar al-Assad :We have to see this coup as reflecting instability and disturbances within Turkey, especially at the social level. It is possible that the effect is political or any other type, but, certainly, when a country is destabilized, the principal causes are rooted in its own society.\\nThis is independent of who governs Turkey and who is its president/ leader because this is an internal matter. We do not intervene nor will we commit the error of saying that Erdogan must step down from power or that he must stay. This is a Turkish issue and it is for the Turkish people to take a decision on this matter.\\nBut the most important matter in this coup is that we have to see the measures and steps that Erdogan and his group adopted in recent days, when they began to attack the judicial system. They expelled from office more than 2,700 judges, more than 1,500 university professors and more than 15,000 employees in the education sector. What do the universities, the judges and the civil society have to do with the coup?\\nThese measures reflect the evil intentions of Erdogan, his bad character and his real intentions with respect to what has happened. If the investigations are still underway, why take the decision to dismiss all these people?\\nThus he has used the coup to execute his extremist agenda, a blueprint of the Muslim Brotherhood’s, on Turkish soil. This is very dangerous for Turkey and for the neighboring countries, Syria included.\\nPrensa Latina : How do you assess your Government’s relations with the opposition based in the country? What is the difference between these oppositional groups and those based abroad?\\nBashar al-Assad :We have good relations with the opposition within Syria, based on national principles. Clearly they have their own political agendas and doctrines and we have our own agenda and doctrine. We can enter into dialogue with them directly or through the ballot boxes, which is another form of dialogue.\\nThis is the situation in all countries. But we cannot compare this opposition with the opposition based outside Syria. This is because the concept of opposition signifies using pacific means and not supporting terrorists. This opposition is not formed outside the country and has a popular base among the Syrians that live here.\\nThe popular bases cannot be directed from the chancelleries of the United Kingdom or France or through the Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United States intelligence services. This is not an “opposition” as they call themselves; we call them traitors because the true opposition, the one working for the Syrian people, is based in Syria and adopts its agenda from this people and functions in the interests of the homeland.\\nPrensa Latina : How do you assess the insistence of the United States and its allies that you have to abandon power and the media campaign that they unleash to smear the reputation of its Government on the international scene?\\nBashar al-Assad :With respect to the proposition that I abandon power, they have been saying this for five years yet we have never given it any importance, nor even responded with any declaration whatsoever.\\nWe have never given it importance. This is a Syrian matter and the Syrian people are the only ones with the power to determine who must stay and who must resign, who must stay in office and who must abandon it. The West is abundantly aware of our position on this matter.\\nConsequently, we are not very bothered with this issue. We don’t even waste time thinking about what they say. I am here thanks to the support of the Syrian people. Were it not for this support, I would not be here. It is as simple as that.\\nWith respect to sullying reputations or attempts to demonize certain Presidents, this is the US’s modus operandi – at least it has been from the Second World War, since they replaced British colonialism in this region and possibly in the entire world.\\nFrom that time, the US administrations and the US politicians have never uttered a word of truth on any issue. They always lie. And with the passage of time, they have been converted into expert liars. This is part of their policy. Their attempt to demonize me is similar to their attempt to demonize President (Vladimir) Putin, in the last two years, and to demonize the Cuban leader Fidel Castro over the last five decades. That is how they operate.\\nSo we must know that this is how the US acts and therefore we must pay no heed to what they say. The important thing is to maintain a good reputation in the eyes of our people. This is what we have to concern ourselves with.\\nPrensa Latina : Mr President, what is your opinion on Syria’s relations with Latin America, especially its historical ties with Cuba?\\nBashar al-Assad :Despite the enormous distance that separates Syria and Latin America, the level of knowledge that the people, not simply the politicians, in that region have, on this part of the world, never ceases to amaze us.\\nI think a number of factors account for this, one of which lies in the historical similarity and commonalities between Syria and Latin America.\\nFor much time, Latin American countries suffered from direct occupation. Thereafter they suffered the action of US companies, coup d’etats and US interference. This is why, the people of this region know what it means for a country to be independent or not. They understand that the war in Syria hinges upon its independence.\\nBut the most important thing in this part of the world is the role of Cuba, which has always been the launching pad of Independent Movements in Latin America. In this context, Fidel Castro is an icon.\\nAs a result, at the political level and in terms of knowledge-base, we can say that there are strong similarities between Syria and Latin America, especially Cuba.\\nBut I do not think that we are doing enough to improve other aspects of our relationship so that they are at the same level, basically in the sectors of education and the economy. This was my ambition before the crisis. I was in Latin America – Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil– to strengthen our relationship. Then the conflict broke out and and it mutated into a huge obstacle pre-empting any action on this matter.\\nEven so, I do not think that our relations have to be limited to their historical and political aspects. This is not sufficient. There are several sectors and the inhabitants of both regions have to get to know each other better. Distance could prove an obstacle but not necessarily so, since we have strong relationships with the rest of the world to the East as well as the West.\\nI mean, today, distance no longer presents an obstacle. I think that if we manage to overcome the crisis and this war, then we will have to work with greater force to revive different aspects of this relationship with Latin America, especially with Cuba.\\nPrensa Latina : Mr President what are your expectations, what do you think of the current electoral process in the United States, especially the presidential elections? How do you think the result may influence the war in Syria?\\nBashar al-Assad :We renewed relations with the United States in 1974, 42 years ago. From that time we got to know various US leaders in different cases.\\nThe lesson that we have learnt is that noone must put their money on a US president. This is the most important thing. Thus the problem is not the name. They have institutions and their own agenda and each president comes to execute this agenda in his own way. But, he must, absolutely, comply with this agenda.\\nEveryone has military agendas. The only difference lies in the method of execution. One deploys its army, as Bush did, and others send in their mercenaries and agencies as Obama did. But every president has to fulfil this agenda.\\nI do not think that in the United States, the head of the White House is allowed to fulfil his political convictions. He has to submit to institutions and to pressure groups. And these groups have not changed; nor have the plans of institutions changed. This means that the US will not have in the near future, a president that can bring about a serious and radicial change in US politics.\\nPrensa Latina : What message do you want to sent out through this interview with Prensa Latina to the governments and peoples of Latin America and the Carribean, as well as the people of the United States, especially on the importance of supporting Syria’s struggle against terrorism?\\nBashar al-Assad :Latin America is a good example and important for the whole world on how countries and governments have succeeded in recovering their independence. This region is the backyard of the United States, but Washington has used it to try out its maneouvres and to execute its own agenda.\\nThe Latin American people have sacrificed a great deal to reach their independence and after recovering it, they transformed into countries on the path to development or even developed countries.\\nThus independence is something very important and greatly cherished by all Latin Americans. We consider that they must preserve it, because the United States will not stop working to topple any independent government that represents the great majorities in each country in this region.\\nCuba is very well aware of this and knows, more than any other country in the world, what I am talking about. You have suffered US manoeuvres more than any other country in Latin America and have successfully dealt with all these attempts for more than 50 years, only because your government represents the Cuban people.\\nThis demonstrates that holding a tenacious grip on this independence is of vital importance, in my judgement, for Latin America’s future.\\nWith respect to Syria, we can say that Syria is paying the price for its independence, because at no point in time have we acted against the United States, France or the United Kingdom.\\nWe have always tried to develop good relations with the West. But the problem with these [countries] is that they do not accept that any country is independent, and I think that this is the position they took with Cuba as well.\\nYou have never tried to damage or harm the people of the United States yet they do not accept you as an independent country. The same happens with the other countries in Latin America. This is why there have always been coups in these countries especially during the years 1960-70.\\nAnd this is why I think that preserving self-determination in a country cannot be achieved in isolation. If I want to be independent, then I have to support independence across the whole world, because if one acted alone, then I will be weak.\\nThe support for Syria will principally be in international fora. There are many organizations, notably the United Nations, despite its incapacity. Clearly, the support of these entities can perform an active role in supporting Syria.\\nThe natural [locus for support] is the UN Security Council and its position depends on its non-permanent members. The support of any other organization for Syria will also be important.\\nPrensa Latina : Mr President, we know that you are a very busy person and for this reason Prensa Latina highly values the time that you have granted us for this interview when your time is invaluable. We would wish to have this type of interview in the future with you.

Native Americans maintain a spiritual tradition with bison , believing that as long as buffalo — a gift from the Great Spirit — roam free and as long as the herds are bountiful, the sovereignty of indigenous people would remain strong. \\nAnd in the midst of mass arrests, mace attacks, and beatings from batons, a stampede of bison suddenly appeared near the Standing Rock protest camp.

The Russian narrative praises the pro-Russian people of Crimea for organizing their own annexation and the endangered East Ukrainians as the people’s republics organized armed volunteers to fight off the extremist rapists and crucifiers sent by the illegal Kiev junta. Russia, of course, could not prevent patriotic Russian fighters from volunteering for duty on the Ukrainian field of battle, some during their vacation leaves. Russian soldiers killed or captured in Ukraine had, after all, signed papers separating themselves from the Russian army. As an innocent bystander, Russia has earned a place as a peacemaker in the Minsk negotiations, but claims it has limited influence over the separatist forces.

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nResidents in the small Russian town of Ryazan, apparently excited by the election of Donald Trump in the United States, have started a petition to have a street in their town renamed “Street of Donald Trump.” The petition was started on “ change.org ,” and, among other things, advocates for the name change because “recently elected U.S. President Donald Trump is a big friend of Russia and is a supporter of traditional values.” \\nPer HeatStreet , the petition has already gathered enough support to be officially reviewed by authorities which means residents are well on their way to “making Ryazan great again.” \\nThe petition for a Trump Street has turned out to be quite popular. It’s gathered enough signatures to be officially reviewed by the authorities. \\n“With a street named after Donald Trump we can make Ryazan great again,” said one of the supporters of the petition. \\n“I’m signing because I was born in Ryazan and Trump is a great person and will change everything for the better,” said another. \\nHere is a loosely translated version of the petition from Google translate: \\nDespite the enthusiasm among many, some residents were slightly less supportive of the “Street of Donald Trump” idea and suggested that the town would end up “looking like idiots” if Trump imposed sanctions against Russia. \\nSome commenters, however, expressed caution: “You should have waited to see Trump’s first moves. What if he will support the sanctions against Russia? You will look like idiots then.” \\nDespite the petition’s popularity, a city official thinks it’s unlikely the street will actually be renamed. “According to Ryazan city regulations,” the official said, “the street can be named after a famous person, Russian or foreign, only five years after the death of this person”. \\nMeanwhile, here in the U.S., a 15-year-old student at Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Maryland had to be rushed to the hospital after being beaten up by 4 other students for wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. \\nHundreds of students from Richard Montgomery High School were carrying signs reading, “Love Trumps Hate,” and chanting near the Rockville courthouse on Maryland Avenue in a protest that began at about 10 a.m. when a 15-year-old boy wearing one of the Trump campaign’s “Make American Great Again” hats was attacked by about four students. \\nThe group surrounded the teen, punching him repeatedly, then threw him to the ground and kicked him repeatedly in the ribs. \\n“They jumped him and beat him up pretty bad,” Max Stucky, a bystander who witnessed the attack, told WTOP. \\nThe teen, who wasn’t seriously hurt, was seen clutching the back of his head in pain.

The musical power couple headlined a free get-out-the-vote concert in Cleveland on Friday night. . Cole, Chance The Rapper, and Big Sean were also among the list of artists who performed, offering their support to the Democratic nominee for president. As the concert’s official main headliner, Jay-Z kicked off the event with “Dirt Off Your Shoulder,” “F—WithMeYouKnowIGotIt,” and a couple of his older hit records. Shawn “Jay Z” Carter also brought out Big Sean to perform “Clique”. After Big Sean, Chance The Rapper, and J. Cole finished, Beyoncé made her entrance with her anthemic “Formation.” But before “Freedom” rang out, she shared her thoughts about the election. “There was a time when a woman’s opinion did not matter. If you were black, white, Mexican, Asian, Muslim, educated, poor, or rich, if you were a woman, it didn’t matter,” Beyoncé said. “Less than 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote. Look how far we’ve come from having no voice to being on the brink of making history again, by electing the first woman president. But we have to vote. The world looks to us as a progressive country that leads change.” She continued: “Eight years ago, I was so inspired to know that my nephew, a young black child, could grow up knowing his dreams could be realized by witnessing a black president. And now, we have the opportunity to create more change. I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless. “We have to think about the future of our daughters, our sons, and vote for someone who cares for them as much as we do,” she continued, concluding: “And that is why I’m with her.” After Beyonce’s performance, she and her husband, Jay Z, bowed, hugged, and kissed, ending their night with their official endorsement of Hillary Clinton. then Jay Z made his endorsement. “I want to grow up in a world where our daughter has no limitations. She can feel like she can be whatever she wants to be in the world,” he said. “This other guy [Donald Trump], I don’t have any ill will towards him, but his conversation is divisive, and that’s not an evolved soul to me. He cannot be my president. He cannot be our president. Once you divide us, you weaken us. We’re stronger together,” Jay Z added. Jay Z then welcomed Hillary Clinton on stage and, along with Beyoncé, gave the 69-year-old politician a big hug. Then, the former Secretary of State grabbed the mic. “We have a woman who is an inspiration to so many others. I thank Beyoncé for standing up and showing the world we are strongest when we look out for each other,” Clinton said. “And I thank Jay for addressing in his music some of our biggest challenges in the country: poverty, racism, the urgent end for criminal justice reform.” \\nIf you haven’t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so.

       "  'Poll: Sexism Was NOT A Factor In Hillary\\'s Loss By: Aaron Bandler November 11, 2016 \\nSome leftists still reeling from Hillary Clinton\\'s stunning defeat on Tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president. However, a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in Clinton\\'s loss. \\nThe poll, conducted by Conquest Communications Group and published on Just Facts , featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism: \"If you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate, who would you vote for?\" \\nHere were the results (emphasis added): \\nOverall, 69% of voters said “It does not matter,” 15% preferred a female, 12% preferred a male, 3% were unsure, and 1% refused to answer. \\nMale voters and Trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say “It does not matter,” at 73% and 72% respectively. The other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error, with rates of: 67% for Clinton voters. 66% for undecided voters. 64% for females. \\nNaturally, supporters of Trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president–25 percent to 2 percent, respectively–and Clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president, 27 percent to 5 percent, respectively. \\nThe survey was conducted from October 11-23, so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election. But it\\'s hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists. \\nThere is a little bias towards a male president among Trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among Clinton voters, but the results of the survey suggest that overall, the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the United States. \\nDemocrats will have to find a different strategy for identity politics since the gender card doesn\\'t work. Speaking of identity politics, it looks like the race card seems to be in trouble as well . Tags '],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nA screenshot from “An Open Secret,” a 2015 documentary about pedophilia in the entertainment industry . \\nI’ve got some good news and some bad news. \\nLet’s start with the bad news: this is one of those unpleasant, disturbing articles that I sometimes write here at CDP. It deals with a topic that I wish didn’t exist to be reported. But reality is what it is, so we might as well face it head-on. \\nWhich brings me to the good news: “The truth shall set you free.” \\nThat teaching is, of course, from Jesus, found in the Gospel of Sty. John, and it is the torch that we will carry to brave the dark tunnels ahead. As bad as it is, the good news is that dragging perversion and corruption into the light is the only way to destroy them, and the only way to set others free from the corrupt. \\nIn any case, here is what we know so far about “Twittergate,” according to a recent post by NorthCrane.com : \\nSeveral Twitter users [earlier this week] were reporting child pornography accounts and sending them to 0hour, an active member of Anonymous. The Anonymous user, @0hour , was retweeting them and tagging Twitter, FBI and Disney. The YouTube user, notsafeforjerk, is providing up-to-date reports on #Twittergate . \\nJust some of the Twitter accounts exposed for posting child-sex content \\n[embedded content] \\nI can’t understand this man’s accent well at all, but your mileage may vary. \\nNot surprisingly, a few hours later, “0hour got his account suspended”–and it’s not the first time his account has been suspended–yet, very disturbingly, “many of the child pornography accounts remained active, despite the child pornography being publicly displayed on the Twitter accounts.” \\nNo comment. \\nI know of one Twitter user whose account has been banned 11 times (and counting) in the last few weeks, and once three times in the same day, because he consistently tweets about the Podesta pedo ring, #pizzagate , spirit cooking, the Clinton Foundation’s human trafficking baggage, and so on. (He is able to restore his account almost immediately, however, because he uses Keybase, which, provides proof of his identity so Twitter readmits him under a different handle/name.) \\nAt this point, the Twitter gods are either malicious for allowing such content to remain public, or too apathetic and incompetent to do anything about it, which, in terms of public harm, is just as bad. \\nThe North Crane article ends on this note: “As more people become involved in the manhunt, the scope of horror increases.” \\nSadly, this is truer than the author might have realized. \\nHold fast to those torches, dear readers; we’re going farther down the tunnel. \\n+ + + \\nThe reason Twitter may be “asleep at the wheel” during this #Twittergate storm is that Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, may very well be involved in the pedophilia underworld inhabited by the rich, the famous, and the powerful in Obama’s America. \\nThe “blueprint” for the esoteric “spirit cooking” rituals that were exposed in the weeks before election day is Marina Abramovic’s 1996 cookbook of the same name. **** \\nTen years later, Dorsey gave a nod to the ritual in this tweet : \\nMaking “pasta” and “Satanic” allusions are key elements/codes in Spirit Cooking. \\nAs the replies indicate, this tweet was unearthed within the last day, and has a disturbing significance in light of the larger Podesta ring. \\nAt this point, a natural objection is to shrug this off as a weird possible aspect of one CEO’s life. \\nUnfortunately, Dorsey’s strange affinity for the pedo world belongs of a larger context. The 2015 documentary An Open Secret was directed by Amy Berg, and “exposes how pedophiles operate in Hollywood and cover up their crimes.” In addition, Berg’s 2006 documentary on the Catholic Church’s cover-up of pedophilia/pederasty, Deliver Us from Evil , was nominated for an Oscar. \\nThe Hollywood Reporter has described the film as “A sober look at…the sexual exploitation of teenage boys in the entertainment industry by the older men who can make or break their careers…. [W]ith any luck it will encourage other victims to speak up, and enlighten the parents of showbiz aspirants about the industry’s dangers.” \\nSeveral journalists are included in the film. One journalist said his story documenting the sexual crimes committed by top Hollywood figures was censored. \\nBerg said she could not find any company willing to distribute her film until Rocky Mountain Pictures, the distributor behind such ground-breaking conservative-oriented documentaries as Obama 2016 , stepped up to release An Open Secret in various cities this summer. \\nThe film identifies a pedophile ring led by a convicted sex offender named Marc Collins-Rector, who had ties to the rich and famous in Hollywood. Collins-Rector established an Internet-based TV company called Digital Entertainment Network (DEN). \\nBad news: this is real. \\nGood news: they can’t hide anymore. \\nOne blogger hit the nail on the head when he says that for years conservatives, \\nhave tried to argue why their positions on a given issue were better than the liberal positions pushed by the entertainment industry. … But to be persuaded about the whole sweep of their criticisms, you’d have to evaluate every argument….. \\nA far more efficient use of time, money, and energy is not to attack all the myriad weirdnesses that Hollywood produces, but to attack the source from which they spring . If what produced them is rotten, polluted, and corrupted, the average person is willing to believe that the fruits themselves are rotten, polluted, and corrupted. \\nAs such, he argues, the DoJ under President Trump ought to attack the Hollywood perverts and “blow the lid off of a similar culture of pedophilia among the DC Establishment insiders.” Because even if our culture is growing more and more tolerant of degradation and immorality, “there’s still one taboo left that everyone recoils in disgust at, and it’s pedophilia.” \\nMore good news: The truth shall set you free–to fight the darkness. \\nShare this article to inform and encourage your friends and family!

       " ['New Play Vicuña Portrays Trump in “Emperor’s New Clothes” Tale',\n",
       "  '“Vicuña,” the new play that opened Sunday at Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, Calif., portrays a Donald Trump-like candidate in an “Emperor’s New Clothes” tale. The satire about a real estate tycoon and reality TV star turned presidential candidate could be perceived as a hatchet job. However, it offers an entertaining topical comedy on the surface, with glimpses into the climate of fear and xenophobia that has spread across America.\\nThe improbable, uncontrollable Republican candidate here, Kurt Seaman (a name that results in sophomoric jokes that take away from the effort), bears an obvious resemblance to Trump. The mogul “wants to add the White House to his list of properties,” as one character notes. The Trumpisms include the well- respected daughter (called Srilanka here), ex-wives with names that evoke Trump’s, negative attitudes toward immigrants and even an uncomfortable feeling in his party that he will hurt them on Election Day.\\n“Vicuña” clearly evolved with the election since the Jon Robin Baitz play (his fourth world premiere for the Center Theatre Group) was drafted earlier this year. It takes place as preparations are under way for the third debate between Seaman (played by Harry Groener) and his unseen female opponent, who clearly did better in the first two debates.\\nDirected by Robert Egan, most of the play’s action takes place in a posh tailor’s atelier, where the character Anselm Kassar (played by Brian George), an Iranian Jewish immigrant, designs garments for presidents and world leaders that create the illusion of power and confidence. The character is based on an actual Washington, D.C., tailor named Georges de Paris, a Greek immigrant who crafted suits for presidents for decades.\\nSeaman decides that for his last debate he needs a magical, powerful suit made out of the finest vicuña (hence the name) for him by the great presidential tailor. “Clothing conveys credibility,” is the premise. He believes the polls are lying: “People are afraid to admit they are on my side.” However, just in case, this emperor wants new clothes.\\nThe tailor decides, ignoring his personal feelings, to make a suit for a candidate that he finds repellent and make him more. He cannot resist the reflected glory of his powerful suits on the wannabe or truly powerful.\\nSeaman is at first delighted to meet the tailor’s apprentice, Amir Masoud (played by Ramiz Monsef), who is the son of immigrants. He tells him “Apprenticeship is good. It’s my thing.” But the candidate’s world view collides profoundly with this young Muslim man’s concepts of justice and America. The candidate actually comments that if people cannot make it in their own country and flee, “what kind of people are we letting in?”\\nAmir serves as the play’s conscience and challenges the candidate (and his daughter). He points out, “A suit can’t stand in for actual goodness and vision.” Amir’s character (like others in the play) is uneven and his actions do not always convey his feelings (like taking advantage of his prep school and Harvard University scholarships before flaunting his Marxist leanings.)\\nSrilanka (played by Samantha Sloyan) is tired defending her dad against his inappropriate comments. Initially, she tells Amir, “His message is lost when he is not ‘disciplined.’” The dutiful daughter even boasts that “when he’s elected he will be far more human than he’s being painted.” However, once he speaks positively about woman at her alma mater and then does a disparaging sexist interview, she can no longer ignore his inappropriate comments.\\nThe Republican party leadership cannot ignore his “pitchfork campaign” and questionable opinions either. They offer Seaman billions to throw the debate and not become president. The real estate tycoon is now engaged in negotiations “to buy and sell the presidency.”\\nThe final scene is the debate, with the candidate and his exquisite vicuña suit. The final act of the real election is yet to be played. But this play’s final act is veers into darker territory and an “emperor has no clothes” type moment.\\nThe Vicuña cast is excellent. Groener avoids the obvious parody, but conveys the appropriate pomposity. Sloyan does a great job displaying early confidence crumbling to vulnerability of Srilanka’s campaign life. However, the key character is Monsef’s Amir, and the actor is up to the task of carrying the audience on his journey challenging the candidate’s beliefs and actions.\\n“Vicuña” portrays Trump in an “Emperor’s New Clothes” type tale, opening one week before the election. Baitz’ new play may not have a long shelf life now. However, it raises some serious issues that are not going away on Nov. 9. Maybe the play will be dusted off years from now and presented as a dramedy based on actual people. But, in the meantime, the reality is a little too real as election day looms.\\nWritten and Edited by Dyanne Weiss\\nSources:\\nPerformance Oct. 30\\nCenter Theatre Group : Vicuña\\nLos Angeles Times: Q&A The timely new play ‘Vicuña’ is, and isn’t, about Donald Trump\\nPhotos of Groener (top) and Monsef and Sloyan by Craig Schwartz. courtesy of Center Theatre Group. baitz , Center Theatre Group , Kirk Douglas , vicuña'],\n",

       " ['Globalization Expressway to Universal Slavery',\n",
       "  'If humans were largely moral and ethical beings, then globalization could be a workable proposition. Unfortunately, the dark behavioral narcissism expressed by compulsive greed and an infinite appetite for power seems to have become the guiding precept of our collective nightmare. If only the desire to dominate others and have a lot more than them were not the prime motivations for the global elite on top of the human food chain, we could all have our respective modest slice of happiness on this planet. The Utopia of globalization through institutions such as the United Nations (UN), World Bank , and International Monetary Fund (IMF) was supposed to eradicate the universal pestilence of war, extreme poverty , hunger and slavery using the might of the above supranational institutions to prevent the rise of so-called rogue nations usually ruled by dictators.\\nWorld order of chaos with misery for profit\\nThe opportunity of this push for a supranational form of government has to be understood in the psychological context of a world traumatized by World War II. Many public servants, who had fought against the Nazis and their Japanese and Italian allies, had genuinely the best intentions at heart when institutions like the UN were set up. If some of the original ideas were good and moral to some extend, a rot almost immediately contaminated and perverted most of the created institutions and quickly — using the pretext of the Cold War — allowed the birth of a monstrosity such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ). The globalists have controlled and ultimately Wall Street has financed, supranational government instances such as the UN, IMF, World Bank and a myriad of non-governmental organization (NGO) little helpers. Not only have these done nothing to curtail the man-made disasters of war, climate change , slavery and poverty, but they have exacerbated them, all for the sake of profit.\\nIn this Orwellian time of moral decay, human misery is good for business. In a globalization controlled by Wall Street’s puppeteer sociopaths, who believe they are the masters of the universe, ordinary people everywhere have become canon fodder and slave labor. They are not even collateral damage but human lubricant, as viewed by the elite. One can see that if they are not stopped immediately, trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and its Trans-Atlantic counterpart could seal the deal of the establishment of an atrocious world government, controlled by a few thousands, in complete disregard of not only national interest, but also cultural diversity.\\nLook what happened to Detroit, Michigan, and countless other manufacturing towns in the United States that are all collateral damage of Bill Clinton’s North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The massive trade agreements in the works, to be put in place by the globalists if they remain in power, are intended to annihilate any form of economic or political independence from the signatory countries and to scatter their populations to the wind, as in the case in the globalist-controlled demolition of the Middle East in Iraq, Libya and Syria. Displaced and disenfranchised populations are beaten into submission and used as docile worker bees.\\nDrastic action or hell on earth\\nIf we let the globalists complete their worldwide coup already in progress, then all sovereignty would be lost, and most of the world’s population would become slave-wage laborers at the mercy of the global corporate empire. Countries with a diversified agriculture would be turned into one-crop wastelands to ensure that most of the food supply has to be imported. Pseudo local governments would merely officiate as the slave drivers for the global elite. This must be stopped at all cost and undone by all means necessary. If we allow this final coup by the geriatric psychopaths at the top of the current world order, thousands of years of our rich human experience would be wiped out. Like poorly made cheap electronic products, the cultural garbage of the lowest common denominator empire would flood the world. This cultural homogenization would affect primarily the information available to people. Since dissent is impossible without correct information and critical thought, the globalists want their propaganda to become the only source of information. With the UN, the World Bank and the IMF, the political and economic framework financed by a worldwide network of banksters is already in place. Influential nations, on paper, like France and the United Kingdom, which are still officially full fledged members of the UN Security Council, have de facto abdicated their sovereignty to become vassals and secondary enforcers of the globalist plan. We are at the edge of an existential threat of greater magnitude than ever before in human history.\\nThe semantics of deception\\nMachiavelli is known for his cynical view of political power; however, the advice the author of The Prince gave to the powerful of his time seems innocent by comparison to the depravity of today’s puppet masters. Words and ideas are gutted of their meaning to signify, most of the time, the exact opposite. For example, globalist eminence grise George Soros’ Open Society Foundation is an opaque giant NGO, with more than 100 offshoots worldwide by its own admission, but its tentacles are in reality more far reaching. The recent publications of Wikileaks in the voluminous Podesta email files have been a revelation of the extent of deception victimizing United States citizens. John Podesta may be viewed as a Soros right-hand man in the US in charge of delivering the returns for the globalist’s investments in the US elections. The connection between the two men is not only obvious but also official considering that Soros financed Podesta’s so-called Center for American Progress, the fake left equivalent of the neocon think tanks. The term progress is a lure that signifies power, just like Soros’ open society is, in reality, an exclusive club as tight as oysters reserved only for Soros’ chosen associates to savor. What is apparent from the email treasure trove is that Podesta’s job is really to supervise Hillary Clinton on behalf of Soros. In this context, the expression, leader of the free world, to describe the US president becomes a lie. The current world order of the globalists is anything but free, and one applicant for the job, Hillary Clinton, is not a queen on the chessboard, but a pawn.\\nAxis of resistance: Russia, China and Iran and lessons from Haiti’s revolution\\nOne could ask: isn’t this psychopathic globalist coup of financiers well on its way? Isn’t it a done deal, and how can we resist and salvage anything? The examples of Russia, China and Iran prove that, as national entities, we still can. Germany, Japan and South Korea could reclaim their independence and kick out their US occupation. France and the UK could stop being submissive nations and get out of NATO. That would be a start. The path of war rhetoric expressed by the globalist mouthpieces of the West against Russia, Iran and, to a lesser extent, China has to do with the national resistance of these three countries. The citizenry of Europe and North America should understand, that if such unprecedented conflicts occur, all countries will be on the front line, and there is more than enough fire power on each side to ensure massive destruction and no winning side. Russia, China and Iran are the last national obstacles to the globalist coup, and perhaps we are heading back to a bipolar two-block world order similar to the Cold War era. Other options, including the dismantlement, or at least the curtailment, of supranational organizations such as the UN, World Bank and IMF would surely be the side effects of what appears to be in many countries a revival of nationalism. The final plan of the globalists would be atrocious for all of us. Waving the white flag is not an option. At this critical time of our history, and before our collective enslavement, we should all emulate the brave Haitian slaves who beat not one, but three empires 212 years ago. Haitians were only the last ones to prove that it can be done; it must be redone.\\n Gilbert Mercier is the editor in chief of News Junkie Post and the author of The Orwellian Empire .'],\n",

       "  'Getty - Josh Edelson \\nThe Yale Record, America’s “oldest college humor magazine,” taunted the IRS on Thursday by essentially endorsing Hillary Clinton for president by “not” endorsing her. \\nThe magazine is a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, meaning they are prohibited from engaging in political activities. \\nThe Yale Record is walking a tightrope as it relates to their non-profit status. Read the editorial board\\'s post below: \\nIn its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.” \\nThis year’s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code. \\nIn particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. \\nThe Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein. \\n—The Editorial Board of The Yale Record \\nAny reasonable reader would infer that the editorial board is indeed supporting Clinton for president. The only question is whether the paper gave itself enough legal wiggle room before publishing what might as well be a full-throated endorsement. Image Credit: Jemal Countess/Getty Images \\nHere\\'s what the IRS has to say on the matter: \\n“...tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are prohibited from participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office. Charities, educational institutions and religious organizations, including churches, are among those that are covered under this code section.\" \\n[...] \\n“These organizations cannot endorse any candidates, make donations to their campaigns, engage in fund raising, distribute statements, or become involved in any other activities that may be beneficial or detrimental to any particular candidate. Even activities that encourage people to vote for or against a particular candidate on the basis of nonpartisan criteria violate the political campaign prohibition of section 501(c)(3).\" \\nThe Yale Daily News faced similar controversy when it openly endorsed Clinton.

       "  ' Another U.S. Massacre in Afghanistan By Jacob G. Hornberger\\nNovember 08, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" fff \" - The latest massacre of many innocent people by U.S. forces in Afghanistan provides another demonstration as to why it is imperative that the American people stop deferring to the authority of the national security state and demand the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Afghanistan.\\nIn a war that has now gone on for 16 years, U.S. forces just killed at least 32 more civilians, many of whom were children. Another 25 people were wounded. Of course, this is on top of all the wedding parties, hospitals, and other victims of U.S. bombing attacks that have brought the death toll from U.S. interventionism in Afghanistan to more than 200,000, not to mention the wounded, maimed, homeless, and refugees. In the last seven days alone, 95 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan and 111 injured.\\nHow many of those 30 people, including the children, who are now being buried had anything to do with the 9/11 attacks? It is a virtual certainty that none of them did.\\nHow did this latest U.S. massacre occur? Afghan government forces, assisted by U.S. troops, decided to raid a home in a densely populated neighborhood in a village where a Taliban commander was supposedly having a meeting. The soldiers got trapped in a narrow dead-end street, where they began taking enemy fire from surrounding homes.\\nSo, what did they do? Naturally, to save their lives, they called in air strikes, which necessarily involved firing missiles into the neighborhood, which killed those 32 people, including children.\\nThe U.S. military\\x92s position is the standard one: The military regrets the loss of innocent life but, they say, they didn\\x92t really have a choice. If they didn\\x92t fire the missiles, the U.S. and Afghan troops would be killed. If they did fire the missiles, the innocent people living in the neighborhood would die. Not surprisingly, the military chose to protect the lives of the soldiers at the expense of those innocent people living in the neighborhood.\\nBut let\\x92s be mindful of an important fact: If U.S. troops had not still be intervening in Afghanistan, there never would have been a U.S. bombing raid on that neighborhood.\\nHow do the people who survived the massacre feel about what happened? Not surprisingly, they were chanting \\x93Death to America!\\x94 Americans should think about that the next time there is a terrorist attack in the United States.\\nDespite the bombing attack, two U.S. soldiers \\x97 Captain Andrew Byers and Sgt. First Class Ryan Gloyer \\x97 were killed in the battle.\\nWhat did they die for? No, they did not die protecting our freedom or keeping us safe. That\\x92s nothing but pabulum for the families of those two soldiers \\x97 to make them feel okay about losing their loved ones. fThey died for nothing, the same thing that those 58,000 plus U.S. soldiers died for in Vietnam.\\nFreedom and security of the American people have nothing to do with America\\x92s 16-year war in Afghanistan. The Taliban are not coming to get us, any more than the North Vietnamese were coming to get us. The conflict in Afghanistan is nothing more than a civil war, one in which one side is battling to oust a regime that has been installed into power by the U.S. government.\\nOnce the U.S. presidential race is over \\x97 a race in which the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan has barely been mentioned \\x97 the American people need to demand an immediate end to the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan. Continued U.S. interventionism is accomplishing nothing positive and is only pouring fuel on the fire, making matters worse for everyone, including innocent women, children, and others in Afghanistan.\\nJacob G.

Maybe both. Either way, it was chilling. \\nI got the email when I woke up at 7 a.m. on a Monday morning, right as I was getting ready for a busy week. As someone who works in public relations and media, I’m bound at the hip to my email inbox. \\nNeedless to say, the email with the subject line “BOMB” instantly caught my eye. I opened it. “This has to be a joke,” I thought. Another political fundraising email? After all, desperate times do call for desperate measures. \\n“You Nazi f***ing Republicans are going to blow up to pieces,” it began: \\n“You won't live to see the election day, and when your friends talk about how great you and your family WERE, other motherf***ing Republican a**holes would know how dangerous it is to insult the U.S. soon-to-be president Hillary Clinton.” \\nSwell. The election hasn’t even happened yet, and I’m already about to get droned by President Hillary Clinton. Alex Jones was right. Well, at least I’ll go down in a blaze of glory. \\nIt continued: \\n“You have no idea what a liar your gun-loving daughter-molesting pig of a candidate is, but don't worry, I'm gonna show you who he is and how much he really cares about you f***ers who are about to die for him. Sit tight, it'll be over soon.” \\nAnd that was it. My immediate reaction was to send a quick reply, a snarky “Nice to meet you too” or “Do you even know me?” But I didn’t. \\nFor the record, I’ve meticulously tiptoed around expressing public sentiments for or against Donald Trump. Anyone involved in a GOP leadership role is obligated to support whomever the GOP nominates. And if you refuse to back the candidate, you shouldn’t publicly oppose or speak out against said candidate. Plus, there are curtains on the voting booth for a reason. \\nBut as far as the Republican Party is concerned, I have never been a fan of Donald Trump. Heck, I spent months of my life campaigning against Donald Trump in the GOP primaries. And while I am most definitely disgusted by Donald Trump’s comments about women and social issues - and I think I can speak for many lifelong conservatives in my shoes - we should all be completely repulsed by this kind of attempt to threaten or undermine our democratic system through threat of physical harm. \\nAnyone who threatens someone else’s life because of alleged support for Donald Trump (or any other candidate) is threatening a pillar of freedom that makes our republic great. The threat I received this past week is hardly an isolated case, either. It is merely one example of many acts of violence taking place against people of differing viewpoints. David French of National Review wrote a particularly jarring account. \\nYou can bet that no matter the outcome on November 8th, there will be textbooks of postmortems about what happened this year. But it goes without saying that in the most contentious presidential election in recent memory, we seem to have forgotten who we are. \\nWe’ve all “unfollowed” Facebook friends of opposing viewpoints, sent regrettably nasty in-the-moment texts to people with whom we disagreed, and engaged in shameless schadenfreude at the demise of both political parties. \\nBut despite our differences, I think Americans can all agree on one thing: we have a right to vote for whoever we think will be the best leader for our country. As Thomas Paine once said: \\n“The right of voting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights are protected. To take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery, for slavery consists in being subject to the will of another.” \\nAnyone who threatens the life of a fellow citizen because of his or her support for a candidate is attempting to attach a price tag of fear and risk to a vote. \\nDespite intimidation, violence, despair, and bomb threats - go vote.

       " ['BUSTED: Trump Supporters Get Caught Creating Fake Badges To Intimidate Voters At Polling Places | Addicting Info | The Knowledge You Crave',\n",
       "  'on October 27, 2016 2:53 am · \\nConservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they’re the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. \\nTrump supporters are taking Trump’s call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them — all of which are illegal. \\nBut, Trump’s deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as “Vote Protectors.” \\nThe group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. \\nAccording to the Huffington Post , \\nStone’s group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake “exit polls,” efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that’s what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group’s websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. \\nIn fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a “bad idea” and “ordered them taken down.” \\nCampaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. \\n“It’s inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,” she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. “When that’s being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it.” \\nIndeed, but that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. \\nAs it turns out, he’s right about the election being rigged, only it’s conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. \\nEarlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. \\n“I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,” Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. \\n“UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn’t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats.” \\nSo not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. \\nAnd that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump’s deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it. \\nFeatured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Share this Article!

       " ['The US Threatens Irish Neutrality',\n",
       "  '“We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible.”\\n–Proclamation of Easter Week 1916\\nControlling their own destiny has always been a bit of a preoccupation for the Irish, in large part because for 735 years someone else was in charge. From the Norman invasion in 1169 to the establishment of the Free State in 1922, Ireland’s political and economic life was not its own to determine. Its young men were shipped off to fight England’s colonial battles half a world away, at Isandlwana, Dum Dum, Omdurman and Kut. Almost 50,000 died in World War I, choking on gas at Ypres, clinging desperately to a beachhead at Gallipoli, or marching into German machine guns at the Somme.\\nWhen the Irish finally cast off their colonial yoke, they pledged never again to be cannon fodder in other nation’s wars, a pledge that has now been undermined by the U.S. Once again, a powerful nation—with the acquiescence of the Dublin government—has put the Irish in harm’s way.\\nThe flashpoint for this is Shannon Airport, located in County Clare on Ireland’s west coast. Since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack on Washington and New York, some 2.5 million U.S. troops have passed through the airport on their way to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. The Shannon hub has become so important to the U.S. that it hosts a permanent U.S. staff officer to direct traffic. It is, in the words of the peace organization Shannonwatch , “a US forward operating base.”\\nThe airport has also been tied to dozens of CIA “rendition” flights, where prisoners seized in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan were shipped to various “black sites” in Europe, Asia, and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.\\nIrish peace activists and members of the Irish parliament, or Oireachtas Elreann, charge that an agreement between the Irish government and Washington to allow the transiting of troops and aircraft through Shannon not only violates Irish neutrality it violates international law.\\n“The logistical support for the U.S. military and CIA at Shannon is a contravention of Ireland’s neutrality,” says John Lannon of the peace group Shannonwatch, and has “contributed to death, torture, starvation, forced displacement and a range of other human rights abuses.”\\nIreland is not a member of NATO, and it is considered officially neutral. But “neutral” in Ireland can be a slippery term. The government claims that Ireland is “militarily neutral”—it doesn’t belong to any military alliances—but not “politically neutral.”\\nBut the term militarily neutral “does not exist in international law,” says Karen Devine, an expert on neutrality at the City of Dublin’s School of Law & Government. “The decision to aid belligerents in war is…incompatible with Article 2 of the Fifth Hague Convention on the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land.” Devine argues that “the Irish government’s decision to permit the transit of hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers through Shannon Airport on their way to the Iraq War in 2003 violated international law on neutrality and set it apart from European neutrals who refused such permission.”\\nArticle 2 of the Convention states, “Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions or war supplies across the territory of a neutral power.”\\nIreland has not ratified the Hague Convention but according to British international law expert Iain Scobbie, the country is still bound by international law because Article 29 of the Irish Constitution states, “Ireland accepts the generally recognized principle of international law as its rule of conduct in relations with other states.”\\nThe UN Security Council did not endorse the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq, making both conflicts technically illegal. Then UN General Secretary Kofi Annan said that the invasions “were not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view, from the Charter’s point of view,” the invasions were “illegal.”\\nShannonwatch’s Lannon says the agreement also violates the 1952 Air Navigation Foreign Military Aircraft Order that requires that “aircraft must be unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition and explosives, and must not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question must not form part of a military exercises or operations.”\\nThe Dublin government claims all US aircraft adhere to the 1952 order, although it refuses to inspect aircraft or allow any independent inspection. According to retired Irish Army Captain Tom Clonan, the Irish Times security analyst, the soldiers are armed but leave their weapons on board the transports—generally Hercules C-130s—while they stretch their legs after the long cross Atlantic flight. Airport employees have also seen soldiers with their weapons.\\nThe Irish government also says that it has been assured that no rendition flights have flown through Shannon, but Shannonwatch activists have tracked flights in and out of the airport. As for “assurances,” Washington “assured” the British government that no rendition flights used British airports, but in 2008 then Foreign Secretary Ed Miliband told Parliament that such flights did use the United Kingdom controlled island of Diego Garcia.\\nInvestigative journalist’s Mark Danner’s book Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War chronicles the grotesque nature of some of the “enhanced interrogation” techniques inflicted on those prisoners. The rendition program violated the 1987 UN Convention Against Torture, which Ireland is a party to.\\nRoslyn Fuller , Dublin-based scholar and author of Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed Its Meaning And Lost Its Way , says terror suspects were taken to sites where “in an appalling re-run of the Spanish Inquisition tactics, [they were] routinely tortured and mistreated in an attempt to obtain confessions and other information.”\\nFuller points out that Article 11 of the Hague Convention requires that troops belonging to a “belligerent” army must be interned. “In other words, any country that would like to call itself neutral is obligated to prevent warring parties from moving troops though its territory and to gently scoop up anyone attempting to contravene this principle.”\\nBesides violating international law, Ireland is harvesting “the bitter fruits of the Iraq and Afghan wars” and NATO’s military intervention in Libya, charges MP Richard Boyd Barrett of the People Before Profit Party and chair of the Irish Anti-War Movement. “The grotesque images of children and families washed up on Europe’s shores, desperate refugees, risking and losing their lives,” he says, “are the direct result of disastrous wars waged by the US, the UK and other major western powers over the last 12 years.”\\nThe Irish government, says Barrett, has “colluded with war crimes and actions for which we are now witnessing the most terrible consequences.”\\nThe government has waived all traffic control costs on military flights, costing Dublin about $45 million from 2003 to 2015. Ireland is currently running one of the highest per capita debts in Europe and has applied austerity measures that have reduced pensions and severely cut social services, health programs and education. Other neutral European countries, like Finland, Austria and Switzerland charge the US military fees for using their airspace.\\nShannon might also make Ireland collateral damage in the war on terror, according to the Irish Times’ Clonan. Irish citizens are now seen as a “hostile party,” and British Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary has named Shannon a “legitimate target,” according to Irish journalist Danielle Ryan.\\nThe Dublin government has generally avoided open discussion of the issue, and when it comes up, ministers tend to get evasive. In response to the charge that Shannon hosted rendition flights, then Minister of Foreign Affairs Dermot Ahern said, “If anyone has evidence of any of these flights please give me a call and I will have it investigated.” But even though Amnesty International produced flights logs for 50 rendition landings at Shannon, the government did nothing. Investigations by the Council on Europe and European Parliament also confirmed rendition flights through Shannon.\\nPeace activists charge that attempts to raise the issue in the Irish parliament have met with a combination of stonewalling and half-truths. Apparently kissing the Blarney Stone is not just for tourists.\\nThe government’s position finds little support among the electorate. Depending on how the questions are asked, polls indicate that between 55 and 58 percent of the Irish oppose allowing US transports to land at Shannon, and between 57 to 76 percent want to add a neutrality clause to the constitution.\\nThe “forward base” status of Shannon puts the west of Ireland in the crosshairs in the event of a war with Russia. While that might seem far-fetched, in 2015 NATO held 14 military maneuvers directed at Russia, and relations between NATO, the US and Moscow are at their lowest point since the height of the Cold War.\\nOf course Ireland is not alone in putting itself in harm’s way. The US has more than 800 bases worldwide, bases that might well be targeted in a nuclear war with China or Russia. Local populations have little say over the construction of these bases, but they would be the first casualties in a conflict.\\nFor centuries Ireland was colonialism’s laboratory. The policies used to enchain its people—religious division and ethnic hatred— were tested out and then shipped off to India, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Guyana, and Irish soldiers populate colonial graveyards on all four continents, now, once again, Ireland has been drawn into a conflict that is has no stake in.\\nNot that the Irish have taken this lying down. Scores of activists have invaded Shannon to block military flights and, on occasion, to attack aircraft with axes and hammers. “Pit stop of death” was one slogan peace demonstrators painted on a hanger at the airport.\\nThat resistance harkens back to the 1916 Easter Rebellion’s proclamation that ends with the words that ring as true today as they did a century ago: “In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valor and discipline and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.”\\n '],\n",
       " ['BREAKING – Obama Betrays America in MASSIVE Move Before He Leaves Office, Media is Silent | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'Email Print President Obama has proven he is nothing but a vindictive man who is upset like the rest of the liberals that the person he was lobbying for didn’t win the 2016 election. But you’d never guess what he did with hit time in the Oval Office running out. President Obama has shut down the aerial surveillance over the U.S./ Mexican border with only two months left in his presidency. He’s trying to make it difficult for President-Elect Donald Trump, as per Watchdog.org The Department of Homeland Security can no longer do its job, and it is not securing the southern border with even the limited measures it has at its disposal right now! This is a move to help illegal immigrants come into this country, with Obama making it less difficult for them to break the law! They won’t be seen, and, thus, they won’t be caught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security shut down Operation Phalanx, the aerial program that helps halt the movement of drugs and illegals across the border. This DHS move is challenged by Rep. Henry Cuellar, who claims that Congress gave this operation funding for the whole year of 2017. Cuellar, who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and the Homeland Security Subcommittee, is composing a letter to send to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson about the shutdown. And this is not the first time Johnson has been challenged. With the help of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Cuellar went against Johnson earlier in the year in February when the Phalanx’s flight operations were reduced. Now, Cuellar is looking for reinforcements in Texas including Sen. John Cornyn and Reps. Mike McCaul and John Carter. McCaul has previously called on DHS to “develop a strategy to gain operational control” of the border. “Over the last several years, Congress has provided billions of dollars to secure the borders but without an end goal in mind,” McCaul stated. McCaul has also worked to make legislation “to require the [DHS] secretary to gain situational awareness through the use of sophisticated technologies and others means, giving our border agents the ability to predict changes in illegal activity.” The DHS claims the illegals coming into the U.S. have declined at the Texas stretch of the border, but apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley rose 27 percent in the fiscal 2016 year alone. In the small Laredo border section, Operation Phalanx accounted for 10,559 apprehensions and 4,007 “turnbacks” from March 2012 to December 2015. Phalanx was credited with seizing 12,851 pounds of narcotics during the period. The fact that Obama would do away with that just because Donald Trump won says a lot about what kind of man our outgoing president is. He would let more criminals and drugs come into this country just to make it harder to control for Trump, but Obama is not hurting Trump—he’s hurting the American people. And that’s disgraceful. With Trump in office in January, however, Phalanx will be up and running once more… and Obama can’t do anything to stop it. What do you think of Obama’s move to shut down aerial surveillance of our southern border?

       "  \" The Failure of Democracy\\nHow The Oligarchs Plan To Steal The Election By Paul Craig Roberts\\n I am now convinced that the Oligarchy that rules America intends to steal the presidential election. In the past, the oligarchs have not cared which candidate won as the oligarchs owned both. But they do not own Trump.\\nMost likely you are unaware of what Trump is telling people as the media does not report it. A person who speaks like this:\\nis not endeared to the oligarchs.\\n Who are the oligarchs?\\n\\x97Wall Street and the mega-banks too big to fail and their agent the Federal Reserve, a federal agency that put 5 banks ahead of millions of troubled American homeowners who the federal reserve allowed to be flushed down the toilet. In order to save the mega-banks\\x92 balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.\\n\\x97The military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.\\n\\x97The neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.\\n\\x97The US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.\\n\\x97Agribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops.\\n\\x97The extractive industries\\x97energy, mining, fracking, and timber\\x97that maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply.\\n\\x97The Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israell\\x92s way.\\nWhat convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes\\x92 reporting and the facts on the ground.\\nAccording to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.\\nI am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillary\\x92s public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida:\\n\\x93Trump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.\\x94\\nI know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity.\\nI also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country.\\nThis is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote.\\nBy controllng the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.\\nAnd liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.\\nThat the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election.\\nIf this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No \\x93glitches\\x94 caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.\\nThe most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. Americans of all stripes\\x97academics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreigners\\x97live in a false reality.\\nIn the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.\\n Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following. Roberts' latest books are The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism and Economic Dissolution of the West , How America Was Lost , and The Neoconservative Threat to World Order .\"],\n",

       "  'Share on Facebook Share \\nRussia have officially declared that Billionaire George Soros is a wanted man in their country, citing him and his organizations as a “threat to Russian national security”. \\nPutin banned Soros from Russia last year due to the fact that Soros helped to nearly destroy the Russian economy in the early 1990’s. \\nVeteranstoday.com reports: \\nMatt Taibbi of the Rolling Stone said of Goldman Sachs six years ago: \\n“The first thing you need to know about Goldman Sachs is that it’s everywhere. The world’s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. \\n“In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who’s Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.” \\nObviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: “George Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it’s a safe bet he’s had a hand in it.” \\nOne can say that Soros and Goldman Sachs are ideologically part of the same brotherhood. Their strategy is a little different, but the end result is the destruction of lives via the economic system (be it capitalism or socialism) and political manipulation. \\nThat’s why Soros seems to think that he is invincible. He thinks he can move the political and economic planet in a few blinks of an eye and no one can tell him to stop. In fact, he writes books such as The Alchemy of Finance. Soros thinks he can kill political stability throughout Europe and indeed in America with no challenge. \\nSoros is certainly old, but he doesn’t want to be obsolete. His organization has recently been caught conducting covert operations designed to destabilize Russia. Here is an interesting quote from the leaked files of Soros’ Open Society Foundation: \\n“Our inclination is to engage in activities and with actors that will understand and counter Russian support to movements defending traditional values…Naming and shaming from us is problematic: we are also in the business of channeling money into other countries for political purposes.” '],\n",

He had his new son Boomer — born this past May — and his fiancee, Nicole Johnson , was busy planning their wedding. \\nShe told Cosmopolitan in late August that, because of the Olympics, she was taking on all of the wedding planning: \\n\"I took on everything, obviously, because he had to focus on going to the games.

       "  'NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: Money laundering Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.” The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. “People are going to prison,” he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. “If they don’t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,” a federal law enforcement source said. NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said. Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

       "  \"2016 presidential campaign by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley \\nDemocrats used to value things like global peace and justice in the workplace. But, for decades they have given their votes to warmongers and job-exporters. This week, they are mourning the defeat of a politician they once would have despised. In January, lots of Black Democrats will cry over the exit of a president who “won by making himself palatable to white people while also taking advantage of undeserved black pride.” Freedom Rider: Obama’s Hollow Legacy by BAR editor and senior columnist Margaret Kimberley \\n“The sight of Barack and Michelle hosting a state dinner was enough to make black hearts swoon.” \\nObama’s legacy is in tatters, and that is good news. Donald Trump’s victory was not just a win over Hillary Clinton, but against Democratic Party policies that silenced the rank and file. For years Democrats became convinced that the only means of keeping Republicans at bay was to go along with their party leadership without complaint. If they wanted to expand trade deals that stole workers’ jobs, so be it. The people who marched against the invasion of Iraq folded their tents when Democrats became the party of endless war. When Obama promoted austerity and “grand bargains” with Republicans not a word was uttered. Even Black Lives Matter refused to point out that the Obama Justice Department left killer cops unpunished. \\nBarack Obama is nothing if not consistent. While Democrats take to the streets in protest against president elect Trump, Obama declares that the man he once called unfit is not an ideologue, but a “pragmatist.” No one should be surprised about the conciliatory tone. Obama never had a problem with Republicans. They may have obstructed him, but he was always happy to assist them because he wasn’t really opposed to their policies. \\nThe most obvious example of Obama’s lack of substance was his relationship with black Americans. His disdain and contempt for the people who loved him the most was clear to anyone who paid attention. Jokes about “cousin Pookie” and parents serving fried chicken for breakfast should have been seen as the racist screeds they clearly were. But the desire to see a black face in a prominent place endures to our detriment. \\n“The people who marched against the invasion of Iraq folded their tents when Democrats became the party of endless war.” \\nObama won by making himself palatable to white people while also taking advantage of undeserved black pride. Hillary Clinton would be the president elect if the new voters who emerged in 2008 had remained committed to the Democratic Party. But their loyalty was to the imagery of Barack Obama as president. Their joy was confined to seeing him meet the queen of England alongside his first lady or disembarking from Air Force One with his signature swagger. The sight of Barack and Michelle hosting a state dinner was enough to make black hearts swoon. Policy initiatives need not intrude upon the love fest. \\nThe end result of this unrequited and superficial love was six million fewer votes cast for Hillary Clinton in 2016 than for Obama in 2012. The apocryphal cousin Pookie stayed home and no one should be surprised. There is no secret to keeping voters engaged. They are engaged if their needs are met. Deliver for voters and they deliver in the voting booth. \\nEven the unpopular and shady Hillary Clinton could have won Michigan if the people of Flint had received the federal help they needed so badly. Not only did the Obama environmental protection agency allow the beleaguered city to be given contaminated water, but he showed up for a photo opportunity and did nothing else as residents suffered. He drank a glass of water, posed for the cameras and returned to Washington. The people of Flint are still living under conditions Americans think of as being “Third World.” \\n“Democratic voters must ask themselves why they said nothing when their party promoted trade deals that were against their interests.” \\nThe response to Trump’s victory should mean more than protesting policies the Democrats now have little ability to fight. This moment presents an opportunity for much needed introspection and mea culpas. Millions of people did more than just accept Democratic Party policy. They supported actions they would have rejected if carried out by a Republican or a white Democrat. They supported Muammar Gaddafi when Republicans were president but averted their eyes to his murder when committed by a Democrat. They even voted for the person who bragged about the killing. Democratic voters must ask themselves why they said nothing when their party promoted trade deals that were against their interests. Ultimately that acquiescence led to defeat at Trump’s hands. \\nThe Obama team’s propaganda skills were legendary but the day of reckoning revealed the emptiness of what they produced. The corporate media acted like scribes under White House direction and declared that Russia was an enemy state and its president a 21 st century Hitler. Now it is Donald Trump, the self-promoting reality television star, who declares his willingness to talk to his Russian counterpart. It is the sort of behavior that Democrats once valued. \\nDemocratic presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton began the tradition of getting Democrats to support what they didn’t like. Obama perfected the art, which ultimately led to the debacle. He will certainly not be the last to tempt the party faithful but in 2016 Democrats sold their souls and ended up with nothing. Defeat creates the most hollow feelings of all. Margaret Kimberley's Freedom Rider column appears weekly in BAR, and is widely reprinted elsewhere.

A photo posted by Flip or Flop ????

       "  '\\nDean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS – \\nLast week, the Pentagon issued a Defense Department directive that allows “Department of Defense (D0D) personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties.” \\nThe Defense Department has been working on changing the “gun-free” zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years. \\nMilitary.com reports that the directive “also provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on DoD property.” It authorizes “commanders, 05 and above…[to] grant permission to DoD personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm (concealed or open carry) on DoD property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status.” \\nThe directive also makes clear that DoD will consider further changes to grant “[standard] authorizations for other DoD personnel, who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a government-issued firearm, to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on DoD property.” This would allow DoD with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander. \\nKim Smith at Conservative Tribune notes that the policy was a response to an NRA-backed provision in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that required the Defense Department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base. \\n“It is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members, but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available,” NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the Washington Free Beacon . \\nThose wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least 21 years old and meet all federal, state and local laws, the directive said. \\nIt would appear that the Pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support. \\nPresident-elect Donald Trump ran on removing gun-free zones from military bases. On July 9, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Trump pledged to end the gun-free scenarios for U.S. troops by “[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.” \\nThe immediate institution of this directive probably left President Barack Obama incensed, but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway. And that’s good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops, which should always be a priority. \\nLet us know what you think about this in the comments below! \\nGod Bless. '],\n",

       "  'Hillary Will “FIX” Obama’s Failed Economy by RECYCLING His FAILED POLICIES Hillary Will “FIX” Obama’s Failed Economy by RECYCLING His FAILED POLICIES Politics By Amy Moreno October 27, 2016 \\nHillary can’t admit to the American people how BAD the Obama economy is. \\nShe has to “tip toe” around it so she doesn’t offend Mr. Thin-Skin. \\nAlthough, it doesn’t matter much what Hillary says because she has no idea how to fix it. \\nHer plan is to recycle his failed policies as “new failed policies” and round and round we go. \\nFrom Investors.com \\nElection 2016: If you want to know how bankrupt the Democratic Party is today of pro-growth ideas, check out Hillary Clinton’s latest speech on the economy. She has absolutely nothing new to offer that President Obama hasn’t already tried. \\nClinton admits in her speech that things aren’t all they should be in the economy after seven-plus year of Obamanomics. “The challenges we face are significant,” she said. She even took a couple subtle digs at Obama, complaining about “long-term neglect” of poor communities and the fact that the unemployment gap between blacks and whites has been widening, whereas it was narrowing when her husband was in the White House. \\nSo what are the “big, bold” ideas she said she’d implement that will “drive growth”? Spend more money on infrastructure, raise taxes on the rich, impose more mandates on businesses that raise the cost of labor, make college cheaper and saddle the economy with more regulations. \\nIs Clinton really not aware that this is exactly what Obama prescribed, and that his policies have produced the worst economic recovery in history? \\nHer biggest idea is to make “the biggest investment in American infrastructure in decades,” saying that will create “millions of good paying jobs.” \\nApparently she’s forgotten that Obama’s stimulus plan included, as Obama put it, “the largest new investment in our nation’s infrastructure since Eisenhower built an interstate highway system in the 1950s.” \\nHow did that work out for jobs? We’ve had one of the slowest rates of job growth since the Great Depression, and annual economic growth never topped 3%. Oh, and according to Hillary, our roads and bridges are still crumbling. \\nClinton also says she wants to invest in “advanced manufacturing.” But Obama has already nearly doubled spending on this — as part of his plan to create a million manufacturing jobs in his second term. (Manufacturing jobs have climbed only 330,000 since he made that promise.) \\nOther “bold” Clinton ideas are also straight out of the Obama playbook: She wants a “cleaner, more resilient power grid,” free child care, paid maternity leave, more power to unions. She wants to expand on the growth-killing Dodd-Frank bill. \\nPlus, of course, she wants to raise taxes on the rich, as if Obama hasn’t already done that several times. \\nWhat’s most amusing about Clinton’s speech, however, is her claim that cutting taxes and reducing regulations as a growth strategy “has been proven wrong again and again.” \\nIn fact, the strongest periods of growth in the past three decades occurred during the tax-cutting, deregulating Reagan years, and after Bill Clinton agreed to cut taxes and deregulate the banking industry. In the 1960s, it was the result of Kennedy cut taxes. \\nThe inconvenient truth here is that not one of the items on Clinton’s list will do anything to get the economy out of its Obama-induced malaise.

I think it’s reasonable to be concerned that viewing her channel could have a negative impact on girls who may already be struggling with body image issues. The life of a YouTube celebrity is often presented as very glamorous and fabulous, and young girls may look up to that and think that Eugenia’s appearance is something they should be striving for to achieve her level of success.” A photo posted by Eugenia Cooney (@eugeniacooney) on Oct 25, 2016 at 4:02pm PDT \\nResearchers at the National Institute of Mental Health found eating disorders frequently occur during teenage years, with women 2.5 times more likely to suffer from eating disorders than their male counterparts.

       "  'Sam Wenkert November 16, 2016 In a stunning change of pace, each lobbyist that was previously invited to the transition team were buffed out Tuesday evening. \\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that : \\nVice President-elect Mike Pence formally signed documents that put him in charge of the transition team, and officials insisted the 10-week effort to build an administration is on schedule. In one of his first moves, Mr. Pence ordered the removal of all lobbyists from the transition team, said one transition team member with knowledge of the decisions. \\nWhy isn’t this bigger news? Donald Trump and Mike Pence are absolutely practicing what they preach. It is a long-standing tradition on the Hill that for better or worse, lobbyists deserve to run your platform. However, the Trump team are following through with their promise to ‘Drain The Swamp’ by cutting these men out. \\nMike Rogers, the former National Security Senior Advisor to the Trump transition team who was abruptly cut out last night, posted his resignation statement on his website: \\nIt was a privilege to prepare and advise the policy, personnel and agency action teams on all aspects of the national security portfolio during the initial pre-election planning phase. Our work will provide a strong foundation for the new transition team leadership as they move into the post-election phase, which naturally is incorporating the campaign team in New York who drove President-elect Trump to an incredible victory last Tuesday. \\nMike Rogers, among others, did not align with the mission statement of the Trump team to ‘Drain The Swamp.’ Sources report that every single person brought in by Chris Christie was being ousted, perhaps a strategy that was used to identify and rid the team of political insiders and lobbyists. Gone now are the members of his transition team with ties to Wall Street firms and other corporations. \\nIf the Trump team is truly to ‘Drain The Swamp’ on the Hill, this was clearly the first painful step that they must take to get there.

       "  '0 129 \\nOn Saturday, during a ceremony welcoming 17 new cardinals into the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis warned attendees about the divisiveness that he feels is spreading throughout the church. The Associated Press reports that Pope Francis cautioned against the “virus of polarization,” telling the new group of cardinals, “we are not immune from this.” \\nDuring his speech, Pope Francis specifically issued a warning about “our pitiful hearts that tend to judge, divide, oppose, and condemn” and those who “raise walls, build barriers, and label people.” He also encouraged those in attendance to not be so quick to deem those who are different from them an enemy or a threat. \\n‘We see, for example, how quickly those among us with the status of the stranger, an immigrant, or a refugee, become a threat, take on the status of an enemy. An enemy because they come from a distant country, or have different customs. \\n‘The virus of polarization and animosity permeates our way of thinking, feeling and acting.’ \\nPope Francis never called out Donald Trump by name; however, it seems to be more than a mere coincidence that he delivered a speech about accepting immigrants shortly after the United States electorate chose as their leader for the next four years a man who has proposed mass deportation and the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. \\nThis is not the first time that the Pope has spoken out against Donald Trump and his campaign promises, either. In February of this year, when asked about Trump’s proposed border wall, he said , “a person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.” \\nAt least one of the newly appointed cardinals has views similar to Pope Francis’s when it comes to immigration. Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin, who was in the news recently for helping to resettle Syrian refugees despite now vice president-elect Mike Pence’s best efforts to block aid to and limit the number of Syrian refugees in Indiana. \\nTobin recently addressed Trump’s victory, saying that, under him, the priority of settling immigrants and refugees “is going to be challenging.” He added, though, that he believes “the ethical reflection of a nation isn’t reduced to the government” and said that he has “a lot of faith in the American people.” \\nWatch a clip from today’s ceremony, which includes Pope Francis’s remarks, below, via YouTube : \\nFeatured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images Share this Article!

       "  'Getty - Timothy A. Clary \\nBritish actress Emma Watson is best known for her role as Hermione Granger in the “Harry Potter” movies, but in 2016, her career took a shift in a very different direction. \\nWatson, who is a self-described feminist and activist, announced earlier this year she was taking the year off to study, while simultaneously working as a UN Ambassador in the gender-equality-focused “HeForShe” campaign. \\nBut the 26-year-old recently weighed in on American affairs on Facebook , explaining how the presidential election will affect the entire world : \\n“At times, politics may seem disillusioning, filled with rhetoric and smokescreens. However, regardless of our personal beliefs, it can’t be denied that the result of the upcoming US presidential election will have ripple effects around the world and impact, in one way or another, the lives of millions and millions of people.” \\nWatson continued by explaining how the United States is like her “second home,” having close friends that live in the U.S. She added that now, more than ever, she wishes she could vote: \\n\"We know one of the most reliable indicators of peace and prosperity, nationally and globally, is not a country\\'s level of wealth, democracy, or ethno-religious identity; but how well its women and girls are treated (Sex and World Peace by Valerie Hudson). The next president will be able to make decisions about women, about their bodies, about how they are treated at work, on university campuses and at school, about how men treat women and about their rights as citizens . These decisions affect how young people form their ideas of gender. \\nThese decisions will affect whether we believe equality is an idea that matters.\" Loading Facebook Post... \\nShe even defended the American men she knows well, saying they treat women the way they deserve to be treated, but stressed the issue shouldn\\'t be “overlooked or brushed aside”: \\n\"In the last US election, 70 million women cast ballots versus 60 million men. Women, your vote could swing this election. Please go out and vote on the 8th of November. Read up on both sides of your state propositions (if you have any). \\nYou have real power to decide the future of generations to come.\" \\nWatson\\'s letter undoubtedly had good intentions and amassed 144,000 “likes” on Facebook, but some Americans felt her message was incomplete. \\nCarisa Schram, an American woman, argued about those voting for Hillary Clinton in the name of “gender equality”: \\n“Just because she is a the female candidate doesn\\'t mean she is the right female candidate. Her track record or the attempted erased record is appallingly despicable. The way she has treated women is absolutely deplorable. I could never vote for this woman and be able to sleep peacefully at night.” \\nJohn Silk, also an American citizen, piled on the reasons why he wouldn\\'t be voting for the female candidate: \\n“So you think the woman running for office is a shining example of what the first woman American president should be? A person who cheated in order to win the nomination. A person who committed crimes others have been jailed for. A person running a proven corrupt organization? As a citizen of the US this is not who I want as the first female prez. You maybe but not Hillary. No woman should back her up if they truly support women\\'s rights. Voting for her because she is a woman and ignoring her short comings is a travesty to our country.” \\nMason Frost commented : \\n\"I have to disagree with much of this post. \\nFor one, how well women and girls are treated is promoted over democracy. I agree with equality, but it shouldn\\'t have any sort of cost to the democratic process. \\nAlso, there are many more issues than gender equality. That would not be the single basis of my vote. There are so many more factors: economy, immigration, national security, foreign relations, SCOTUS, protections of rights guaranteed by the Constitution, taxes, etc. \\nIf you ever cast a vote based on a single issue, you aren\\'t properly carrying out your duty as an American.\" \\nThough Watson didn\\'t mention either presidential candidate\\'s name in her post, it was pretty clear to most that she\\'s rooting for Clinton. \\nAccording to Glamour UK , the actress spoke last month at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan to promote the UN\\'s HeForShe initiative. Watson celebrated the possibility of a first female president: \\n“I don\\'t know if I would have believed you if you had told me two years ago before I made my HeforShe speech that we might have the first female president of the United States.” Emma Watson talks \\'excruciating\\' election: \\'I wish I could cast a vote\\' // Easy enough, just walk across the border https://t.co/6P5e2ibzfR — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) October 26, 2016 \\nA recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton with a 20-point lead over Trump among female voters.

       " ['Hell Comes to Frogtown: Alt Right and Triumph of Transhumanism',\n",
       "  '\\nWhile Richard Spencer’s half-joke of hailing Donald Trump with R oman salute rose a lot of dust, some remarks in his NPI speech point into rather sinister direction. A posthuman one. \\ntranscript with references and additional a/v material: \\nUndoubtedly, there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Hillary Clinton lost Presidential elections to Donald Trump. If for nothing else, then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears “because: racism, homophobia, xenophobia and whateverphobia”; it was a joy, and a relief, because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism , dubbed “political correctness”, to be a paper tiger. \\nHowever, party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance. As SJW s are, hopefully, moving out from the spotlight of post-historical stage, the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image. If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn, this image will be just as ugly – and just as unreal – as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct “ shitlib ”. \\nIn the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the “alternative right” movement, Richard Spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of “children of the sun”. \\nThis is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent – a manifestation of will, as Spencer would doubtless rectify me – pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal – and quite unidirectional – circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all self-respecting übermenschen – from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists. \\nHowever, there’s a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here. The “pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy” (Nietzsche) in it’s virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by Swastika – as Spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin (or his minions): an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement. \\nThe symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything: Chaos. \\nIn the lines to follow, we’ll provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation: the channeling of chaos principle – and adjacent chaos logic – through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from Spencer’s speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21 st . \\n\\nTriumph of the will or hipster Babylon working \\n\\nIn introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of Donald Trump, Spencer makes one interesting remark: \\n“But even though we always took Trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality – or perhaps too painfully intense reality – when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump, the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. And though these terms are used half-jokingly, they represent something truly important–the victory of will . We willed Donald Trump into office, made this dream into reality. ” \\nIt is all delivered in a manner of an in-joke, not to be taken too seriously. Moreover, to the uninitiated into mysteries of this Internet movement it is probably unclear who is “Kek” and what exactly is “meme magic”. \\nWe’ll start our explanation with lesser weirdness. \\n“Meme” is an expression denoting “inexistent existent”, coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology: memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to “infect” the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. Meme is inexistent because there’s no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based: what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial. Yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because analogy apparently works . However no one seems to pose the question, why it works. \\nWell, it works because it is magical. \\n\\nChaos Magick \\n\\nHere we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern – in fact posthumanist – vein, resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can – and should – be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. If artificial construct is in line with “principle of evolution” it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle; it is imagined into existence . \\nTherefore “meme magick” works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with “memes” as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs. \\nThe goal of practitioner of such magic – a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic – is to change the world according to his will. This is, more or less, what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural “domain” of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it. The peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that it’s practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in Internet. \\nThe idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible . \\nThere are many interesting implications to this. \\nThe first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. So any which way you take, you’ll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. The second is that there’s no hierarchy of higher and lower – there’s only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. As there’s nothing higher, there’s nothing to be revered and everything can – and indeed: should – be an object of ironical laughter. And, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called “dream logic” but in actual fact: chaos logic or un-logic . \\nIn this sense, Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trump’s victory an accomplishment of meme- or chaos magick. \\nTrump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality – virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives – from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks – is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective “reality tunnel”, or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other. \\nIn this sense we can observe new “God Emperor of USA” as a magical creation of Internet, by the Internet and for the Internet – today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the Internet of things. If one is to push Spencer’s remark to it’s logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious Donald is the world’s first president of posthuman race; an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group. \\nSo that was lesser weirdness. Let us proceed now to high weirdness. \\n\\n\\nWe owe the reader an answer to a question: who the hell is Kek? \\nWell, the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal “half-joke”: Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar – Pepe the frog. While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian, because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, I consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic. \\nNamely, Pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums, more precisely: 4chan sub-forum /pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados; a place of absolute freedom, therefore: absolute chaos. \\nThe expression “kek” was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of World of Warcraft , replacing the standard Internet abbreviation “LOL” (“laughing out loud”). Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frog-headed Egyptian deity, signifying Chaos and darkness, and Pepe was rebranded as Kek the deity – ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless. \\nIt is important to point out that in view of the most “esoteric Kekists”, that is: (half grinning) faithful of Kek/Pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities – causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to ‘cuck’(originally: cuckservative), a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not “red pilled” (another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists) by alt right or, should we assume: Kek himself; furthermore, Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek. \\nA good run-down of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification \\nHowever, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum: \\n„One last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture: dubs. \\nEvery post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp. This number represents that post’s entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard. \\nWith the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll. When a poster gets repeated digits, its called “dubs”, “trips”, “quads”, and so on. \\nSince a poster can’t know their post number until after they’ve submitted the post, its common for people to “bet” the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits (…) When that endeavor proves a successful, a “GET” has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated. \\nOut of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/: discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs. It wasn’t long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture: Pepe the Frog (now /pol/’s unofficial mascot) Donald Trump (/pol/’s overwhelming candidate of choice) Repeating digit post numbers (“GETS”) “KEK” (used as an expression of delight, particular in response to Trump’s “trolling” of the establishment, as well as in reaction to unlikely GETs in general) \\n…and a god was born.“ ( source ) \\n\\nSynchronicities related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction. \\nNamely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled. Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its “practitioner” to impose his own will and change the world – as Spencer would put it: make his dreams a reality. \\nI would go further and add: make all reality a dream ; because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman , world. The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism – in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite: a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles – above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being – into nothingness of primordial Chaos. \\n\\nPosthuman traditionalism \\n\\nI already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in USA and Europe are doing the same thing – with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. Namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what it’s leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition – something Richard Spencer likes to call “political theology” – founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths , racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with “do your own thing” mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. After all, if we are to agree with Spencer – half jokingly of course – that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God, then the victory of alt right “traditionalists” is in fact the victory of technological magic; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics . \\nIn the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as traditionalism. The obsession of alt right adherents with “identity” in general and “white identity” in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend: they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . Observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in it’s vanguard, from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic – and to a large extent made up – pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-darwinist stance, especially to be found among “game” bloggers as Chateau Heartiste . If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind – actually the only one there is – while at the same time musing about “alpha and beta males”, “sexual market”, “signaling and counter-signaling”, professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes, genes and biological analogies, he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends. \\nThe allure of alt right lies in it’s dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West, induced by process of globalization. Yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine: discordian dialectic; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos. It is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark – with irony of the man who knows he’s a liar and a cheat. But smug humor goes just a short way. In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for. \\nWe’ll end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right. The words have a definite meanings and power. There’s only one Chaos and there’s only one bringer of light from Chaos – as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frog’s main job . And it’s not the One to be defined as “God from God, Light from Light”, but “God from Gutter, Light from Darkness”. A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness. Hope you guess His name. \\nSo, without a pinch of irony, I declare: be careful who your “hail”. \\n*** \\nAuthor Branko Malić is a Croatian author and owner of Kali Tribune , with the background in classical philosophy.

       "  '“Everyone to your life rafts!” “Every man and woman for themselves!” “This ship is going down!” That is just a snippet of what we imagine to be the conversations happening all around the nation within the offices of DNC members. The DNC and Hillary are certainly no strangers to scandal at this point. These days, news reporters can barely keep up with crimes of the Democrats. The party is reaching new lows, practically pushing each other out of the way to commit fraud and lie to the voters. Meanwhile, continuing to try and only show the world what the Republicans are supposedly doing wrong. They would like Americans to believe that only the Republicans are guilty. There are many problems with this, beginning with all of the evidence available. Just a few days ago, the story broke that Democrats were returning contribution money. Returning money? Why on earth would they do that? It may have something to do with the fact that the tens of thousands of dollars from the personal injury lawyers of the Thornton Law Firm was money the partners received in illegal reimbursements. Campaign finance rules prohibit companies like Thornton from giving more than $2,700 to any singular candidate. Straw donor practices easily allow the firms to get around the rule. We wouldn’t want laws to get in the way of lawyers and money. In Boston, it was uncovered that the law firm gave their partners bonuses the same day they donated to the campaigns–in the same amounts. Dirty money given to dirty politicians from dirty lawyers. Perfect headline for Democrats. High profile Senators and candidates have rushed to “donate” the money they received to the Department of Treasury. This is a common method of “dumping” tainted money from a campaign. The Democrats involved in this scandal include: Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy Former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto Pennsylvania Senate hopeful Katie McGinty New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan Former Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold These candidates all have something very important in common: they are fighting for swing-state seats in Senate races. If wrongdoing stopped there, it would be more than enough to disqualify these people when you go to cast your vote. It did not; it went much further. Already these unethical donations made the small Thornton firm, which boasts just ten partners, one of the country’s largest dollar for dollar political donors. It turns out this is not the first time that this particular law firm helped out Democrats. The Boston Globe revealed that “between 2010 and 2014, three of the firm’s partners gave $1.6M to mostly Democratic candidates. During that same period of time, those same three partners received $1.4M in bonuses from the law firm, in what appears to be reimbursement for their hefty donations.” As this story broke, it encouraged other people to come forward and admit their involvement. Viveca Novak, who reported the story for the Center for Responsive Politics, told FOXBusiness.com: \\nThis may not be an isolated case and is likely not the only one of employees being reimbursed for contributions to candidates. We’ve received emails since the story was published that employees at other companies were pressured to make donations and were told they’d be reimbursed. We always thought it was a much bigger problem, but it is hard to flush out. So here we are with Democrats promptly abandoning ship and handing the money over to the Treasury. Not all of the Democrats, though. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, and best friend to Hillary Clinton, is standing strong and defending her actions. She says she will not return the money until it is proven to be illegal. This is the same Senator who has spent her career sitting on the high horse of condemning hidden money in politics. Elizabeth Warren’s hypocrisy aside, this is a very serious situation. Lawyers representing public interest from The Campaign Legal Center have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. This is certainly just the beginning of uncovering the truth of the Democrats’ campaign practices. The problem we are currently faced with is that the election is 5 days away. Judith Ingram of the Federal Election Commission told reporters that there is a lengthy process to review these complaints for merit and next steps. A complete investigation is exactly what we want and need. It will hopefully continue until they have discovered the whole truth. The election though, is next week. We don’t have time. The Democrats in battleground states have been using filthy money to fund their campaigns. There is absolutely no way to know that this money hasn’t swayed the election in their favor. Voters in these states need to be aware. They must know the truth before they walk into the voting booth. Information in this election is crucial because the Democrats have done such a good job at muddying the waters around the real issues. There is no telling how deep this goes. As of today, we absolutely have enough information to know a few very important facts: The Democratic party as a whole, cannot be trusted to tell the truth . The money that their campaigns use is not all from legal contributions . The only way to send them a clear message that we will not condone their actions: vote Republican. We need Donald Trump now more than ever. Corruption in politics has gotten so bad that many people don’t even bat an eye when we see shocking revelations like this one. On November 8th, we have the opportunity to drain the swamp and root out all of this corruption. We have been given an opportunity, we should take advantage of it! \\nIf you haven’t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment... '],\n",
       " ['ICE Agent Commits Suicide in NYC; Leaves Note Revealing Gov’t Plans to Round-up & DISARM Americans During Economic & Bank Collapse | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'Email Print After writing a lengthy suicide note exposing terrifying plans the government has for American citizens, a US Customs Agent walked onto a pier in NYC and blew his brains out. Sources inside the New York City Police Department have revealed to SuperStation95, the contents of a suicide note found on the body and they are utterly frightening. The note, which says it was written over the course of a full week in advance, outlines why the officer chose to shoot himself: “The America I grew up in, and cherished, has been murdered by its own federal government. Our Constitution has become meaningless and our laws politicized so badly, they are no longer enforced except for political purposes” the note said. “Our elected officials are, to a person, utterly corrupt and completely devoid of any love or respect for the country which pays them. To them, everything is about getting and keeping power, and making illicit money from backroom deals.” The 42-year-old U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer shot himself with a 40 caliber service pistol inside Pier 40 in Hudson River Park at around 11 am. (1) A source at the scene described how the officer calmly walked into the park, took out his pistol and shot himself in the head. A ICE federal agent fatally shot himself in the head at waterfront Chelsea park (pictured) in New York Friday The 42-year-old worked as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officer and his offices were nearby to the scene of the shooting. He was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital but doctors were unable to save him. (2) ICE released a statement Friday afternoon: ‘Tragically, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officer from the New York field office suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound and has passed away.’ It added: ‘The agency is not releasing further details pending notification of the officer’s next of kin. According to the suicide note, the Officer said: “I was hired to enforce the law; to capture and deport people who come to this country against our laws. But now, if I dare to do that, I face being suspended or fired because our President refuses to faithfully execute the duties of his office. Instead, I come to work each day, and collect a paycheck twice a month, for intentionally doing little to nothing. I cannot and will not be party to this fraud; to this usurpation of the law, or to the despicable politicians betraying our nation” the note continued. ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the matter and coordinating with the New York Police Department on the investigation. The agent worked at a field office in lower Manhattan, just blocks away from the scene of the shooting. MENTIONS “FEMA CAMPS” FOR AMERICANS (3) In the suicide note, the officer revealed what he claimed are terrifying plans the feds have been finalizing: “If the American people knew what this government is planning, they would rise-up and overthrow it. If I or anyone else in the federal government revealed what is coming, we would be killed anyway, so now I will reveal what I know. We in federal law enforcement have been drilling for several years to control riots and uprisings from a coming financial collapse and widespread bank failures. The drills involve life-sized images of American men, even women and children, whom we are told to shoot for “practice” and to “get used to it.” We have been told that the economy is terminally ill and will fail in 2016. We are also told the banks are all insolvent and the FDIC doesn’t have nearly enough funds to bail out depositors. We are told these events are unavoidable and it is imperative that the government survive when people rise-up over this. When the collapse takes place, detention camps created under the FEMA REX-84 program in the 1980’s to house illegal aliens whom we were going to deport, will instead be used to imprison American Citizens whom the government feels constitute a “threat.” American citizens will be rounded-up without warrants and imprisoned without trial for God knows how long. These camps have been equipped to carry out Hitler-scale killings! An actual “purge” of Americans citizens by the very government which they, themselves, created and pay for! I cannot be party to this.” The Note goes on to say talk about state-level national guard being disarmed by the feds (4) and over 1 Billion rounds of ammunition purchased by the feds (5) and the Military over-deployed and being shrunk (6) : “The government knows the military will rise-up to stop this, so our military is being deployed overseas, intentionally involved in foreign fights, and deliberately shrunk in size so they cannot be here or help Americans! This is why certain ammunition and weaponry has been removed from state-level National Guard Armories and over a Billion rounds of hollow point ammunition has been bought by the federal government. The states themselves have been disarmed of military-grade firepower so they cannot defend themselves from the federal activities. This is also why local police departments have been militarized and provided with armored vehicles and weapons of war” the note says. “When the inevitable collapse begins to take place, electric power to the entire country will be shut off, as will all forms of communication. All banks will be immediately closed; no one will be able to get any money because all ATM’s will be offline. Credit, Debit and EBT cards will not function. Anyone without cash will have no way to get any. The Emergency Alert System will be used to takeover all broadcast stations and tell the public this is a result of a cyber attack. But while the American people patiently await things to get back to normal, the government will unleash round-ups of citizens they deem militants or dangerous . With all civilian communications out, and all TV and radio stations taken over by the Emergency Alert System, by the time word spreads of what is taking place, the government will already have the upper hand. Federal Prisoners to be GASSED TO DEATH The note goes into a wide array of very specific plans and does so in extremely specific detail about what the feds are allegedly planning. For instance, it talks about federal prisons: “Every federal prison has been outfitted with lethal gas systems. When things go bad, all prisoners in all prisons will be placed in their cells on lock-down. Prison staff will depart the facility, and a certain designated person will trigger a lethal gas system. All federal prisoners, regardless of their crime or their sentence, will be gassed to death in their cells. Once the gas clears, the dead will be removed and the prisons will then be used to house citizens who fight against the federal onslaught.” PRIESTS RECRUITED TO QUELL OPPOSITION (7) The note makes mention about Priests, Rabbis and Clerics from various religious denominations having been recruited and trained to quell resistance: “So intent is the government to succeed they have recruited priests, rabbis and clerics from various religions to quote appropriate Scriptures about “obeying government.” They are being trained to tell people not to fight back and that their best hope is to pray.” EXECUTIVE ORDER 13603 (8) The suicide note goes to great lengths about Executive Order #13603 signed by President Obama on March 16, 2012. The note details: \\nExecutive order 13603 about “National Defense Resources Preparedness.” \\nThis 10-page document is a blueprint for a federal takeover of the economy. Specifically, Obama’s plan involves seizing control of: \\n* “All commodities and products that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals” \\n* “All forms of energy” \\n* “All forms of civil transportation” \\n* “All usable water from all sources” \\n* “Health resources – drugs, biological products, medical devices, materials, facilities, health supplies, services and equipment” \\n* Forced labor ( or “induction” as the executive order delicately refers to military conscription) \\nMoreover, federal officials would “issue regulations to prioritize and allocate resources.” SuperStation95 took a look at this Executive Order from the Government Printing Office (GPO) web site and, sure enough, everything contained in the Officer’s suicide note about this Executive Order is true! To be sure, much of this language has appeared in national security executive orders that previous presidents have issued periodically since the beginning of the Cold War. But more than previous national security executive orders, Obama’s 13603 seems to describe a potentially totalitarian regime obsessed with control over everything. Obama’s executive order makes no effort to justify the destruction of liberty, no effort to explain how amassing totalitarian control would enable government to deal effectively with cyber sabotage, suicide bombings, chemical warfare, nuclear missiles or other possible threats. There’s nothing in executive order 13603 about upholding the Constitution or protecting civil liberties. In what circumstances, one might ask, would a president try to carry out this audacious plan? Executive order 13603 says with ominous ambiguity: during “ the full spectrum of emergencies .” DATABASE OF PREPPERS The suicide note touches on the subject of “Preppers:” “We in federal law enforcement have also been told that the government has a full database of all so-called “Preppers.” Those people will be dealt with first — by armed federal agents coming to take their guns, then their food stocks, so food can be re-distributed as the government sees fit.” If the dead Officer’s claims about an unavoidable economic and banking collapse are true, would it then follow that the Executive Order put in place by Obama, might be activated? Would all of us find ourselves in forced labor, while the government takes OUR food and re-distrubutes it under the Executive Order’s paragraph about “allocating resources?” This is terrifying stuff! There is much more to the suicide note and SuperStation95 is considering how much more to publish. As such, this is a developing story and readers should check back for further updates. THESE COULD SIMPLY BE INSANE RAMBLINGS It is not our intent to cause panic or alarm and while we expect readers to be intelligent enough to discern this on their own, we feel compelled to point out that these could simply be paranoid ramblings of an insane person who killed himself.

And while we stand-by our stories in every regard, this barrage of attacks by SNOPES.com is becoming libelous. \\nWe address the SNOPES.com accusations one at a time: 1) No aspect of our story above is a hoax. What Snopes.com seems to take issue with is the existence and content of a suicide note which was revealed to us by the NYPD. The person from NYPD who gave us this information did so after trying to get two other New York Media outlets, (one TV, the other a newspaper) to publish the story and was rebuked within minutes by media contacts who said “we won’t touch this with a ten foot pole.” The fact that the NYPD now claims “no note was found” does not surprise us at all; NYPD has very close ties with the feds and the feds have an intense interest in concealing or discrediting the information it contained. 2) According to the FCC Licensing Bureau, 95.1 FM in New York City is the HD-4 frequency for WNSH 94.7 FM as licensed by the FCC as shown HERE 3) Our story was written by our News Room staff, not anyone named Hal Turner. 4) Mr. Turner was formerly a paying customer of this radio station from October 7, 2015 thru March 30, 2016. He bought air time from us to air his personal radio show “The Hal Turner Show.” Finances caused Mr. Turner to cancel his programming on our radio station and continue his show on WBCQ International Shortwave , where he is on the air live from 9-11 PM every Wednesday evening. Mr. Turner’s web site is: HalTurnerShow.com . He is welcome to return to our airwaves if his finances improve. 5) SNOPES.com claims Mr. Turner is a “white supremacist.” In reality Mr. Turner worked for the FBI from 1993 – 2008, with his TOD as the Joint Terrorism Task Force from 2003-2008. His job was to infiltrate white supremacist groups to thwart violent criminal acts by such persons. This information came out when the Obama Administration betrayed Mr. Turner in 2009 and arrested him for writing in 2009, what the government PAID HIM $3,000 TO SAY on DATELINE NBC and FOX NEWS CHANNEL just four years earlier in 2005! After three trials (two hung juries) Mr. Turner was Bankrupted by legal fees, was appointed a public defender, who threw the case, resulting in Mr. Turner’s conviction. For SNOPES.com to smear Mr. Turner as a “White Supremacist” when federal court records show the exact opposite, is a prime example of the utterly shoddy research and reporting provided by SNOPES.com \\nThe criticism and SNOPES.com outright falsehoods about this story, and others, have been written mostly by: \\nMs. Kim A Lacapria, Age 37 (born Mar 20, 1979 ) \\n39 Cockonoe AVE \\nBabylon, NY 11702-1901 Those of you who are offended by this type of journalistic misconduct, may wish to contact Ms. LaCapria in a peaceful, lawful, non-threatening and non-violent manner to complain about her shoddy journalism.

Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. \\nIt goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Party’s crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. \\nToday’s stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. \\nWith such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward… \\nIn a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other’s views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. \\nPutin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. \\nThe Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some “burning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,” RIA Novosti reported. \\nOn top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that “building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other’s positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.” \\nAccording to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia’s relations with the US “was not our choice,” however. \\nFor things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia’s interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. \\n“We are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,” Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow… \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV '],\n",
       " ['Breaking: Hillary Got Politically Annihilated… WikiLeaks Just Released A List With ISIS Donors | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  \"According to Conservative Daily Post: Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are the founders of ISIS. We have proven that through emails and documents leaked from WikiLeaks, but liberal media outlets still refuse to cover it. After all, they are still more focused on what Trump said eleven years ago than what Hillary has actually done. Because of brave patriots like Julian Assange, we have been given more evidence that Hillary Clinton is more connected to ISIS than we originally believed. An email was leaked between Clinton and John Podesta indicating that: “Western intelligence, US intelligence and sources in the region” to accuse Qatar and Saudi Arabia of “providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [or ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” Citing the need to “use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets,” said Hillary to Podesta while arguing the current developments in the Middle East were “important to the U.S. for reasons that often differ from country to country.” Odd that Clinton argues Saudi Arabia and Qatar are helping fund ISIS when Hillary’s largest donations come from those two countries. In another correspondence from 2012, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Clinton Foundation, Amitabh Desai, set up a meeting with Bill Clinton for five minutes in exchange for a $1,000,000 “birthday check.” The email adds that the small but rich nation occupying the Qatar Peninsula would “welcome [the Clinton Foundation’s] suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health.” Desai added that while Qatar had already “allocated most of their $20 million … [they were] happy to consider projects we suggest.” Bill Clinton gets $1M from Qatar for his birthday. FYI: It's legal and common practice in Qatar for husbands to beat and rape their wives. pic.twitter.com/oGM2Z9JrVl \\n— Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 13, 2016 We now see two more examples of the Clinton’s acting corrupt and being intertwined with nations that fund ISIS. For those that do not see where the dots connect, let’s simplify how this all worked for Hillary. Hillary, as Secretary of State, would sell terrorist nations large weapons deals only after they gave her a very generous donation to her “foundation.” These weapons, provided by Hillary and her State Department, then filtered down from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya, and so on to create, supply, and bolster terrorist groups. That is exactly how ISIS was created. But instead of blowing them up with an air assault, Hillary and Obama decided to leave ISIS alone. Why? Because ISIS being in the Middle East allows the Obama/Clinton machine to make millions in personal profits from these nations in a repetitive cycle of selling weapons. They are choosing personal gain over eliminating a terrorist group. Let that sink in. Why else have they not arrested Hillary for all of these crimes? The FBI would arrest you in a heartbeat if you went to Facebook right now to praise Allah and ISIS. It also speaks volumes as to why they are trying so hard to silence Julian Assange. If Julian Assange is lying, why are they trying so hard to silence him? \\n— Martin Walsh (@mrwalsh8) October 23, 2016 The media remains silent on all of this. This would be plastered all over the news for months if a President Trump was exposed for this. Ignorant politicians are not the problem. The problem is that ignorant people keep voting for them every election. This is the exact reason we desperately need change in this country, and it starts with Donald Trump. People like Julian Assange have given up their lives to expose corruption in government and allowing Hillary Clinton to win this election makes all of his sacrifices meaningless. He has offered us a chance to revolt against our tyrannical government. Chances likes this do not occur often, and if we do not seize the opportunity, we will suffer another four years of suppression from our corrupt leaders. Vote Trump, so that we can save America and he can pardon Julian Assange. Yes America, after all of this, how can you vote for Hillary or stay at home on election day?! How could you?!

Unfortunately, the media is pushing a false narrative. \\nFact is theses are not protests. According to the law, the events taking place are riots. Under Federal Law, a riot is a public disturbance involving an act of violence by one or more persons assembled in a group of at least three people.

       "  \"Getty - Justin Sullivan \\nThe artificial intelligence system that has accurately predicted the outcomes of every U.S. presidential election since it was created in 2004 is forecasting a Donald Trump victory. \\nUsing various data, including engagement on Facebook and Twitter, the AI system found that Trump is outpacing Barack Obama’s peak engagement numbers during his historic 2008 campaign by 25 percent. \\nCNBC has more details : \\nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, the founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \\nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democrat and Republican Primaries. Image Credit: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images \\n“If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since Internet engagement began in full earnest,” Rai wrote in a report, according to CNBC . \\nHowever, before Trump supporters get too excited about the AI prediction, even Rai admits the social media-focused data model isn’t perfect. Even if Trump is getting more social engagement than Obama in 2008, that certainly doesn’t mean all those social media users will be voting for him. He explained it to CNBC like this: \\nRai said that his system would be improved by more granular data. He said that If Google was to give him access to the unique internet addresses assigned to each digital device, then he could collect data on exactly what people were thinking. For example, Rai said if someone was searching for a YouTube video on how to vote, then looked for a video on how to vote for Trump, this could give the AI a good idea of the voter's intention. He added that there would be no privacy concerns as these internet addresses would be anonymized. \\nThat being said, Rai advised the Clinton campaign not to get complacent in light of the AI's prediction. \"],\n",

       "  'Friday 18 November 2016 by Alex Webster Mannequin Challenge goes completely unnoticed at Southern Rail Workers who appeared to be frozen in time have aroused no curiosity whatsoever at Southern Rail HQ. Customer Service Manager Simon Williams, who always seems to be available at short notice, told our reporter, “Everyone in the department was stock still, and I wandered amount them filming with my smartphone. “I was amazed at their ability to remain totally motionless and unfocused on other stimuli. I even filmed the maintenance people outside, tools in hand, completely immobile. “After filming for a record-breaking twenty-five minutes, I realised I’d forgotten to actually send out the email telling people to prepare for the Mannequin Challenge. “I was the only person in the building doing any activity, even if it was just dicking around because of a YouTube craze. “I’ve never felt so alone; it was like waiting for something I knew wasn’t going to arrive, if you can imagine such a thing.” In the past few weeks, the Internet craze known as the Mannequin Challenge has hit offices and gyms across the UK. Participants must strike a pose in the manner of shop mannequins and then be filmed, giving the impression that a fleeting moment has somehow been captured on film. Why this is considered a challenge or even a good thing is still under debate. Mr Williams continued, “I’ve seen many videos of our passengers standing motionless on cold station platforms, but curiously that was before anyone had conceived of the Mannequin Challenge.

       "  \"brics , geopolitics , cooperation BRICS leaders at the summit in Goa. Source:Kremlin.ru \\nA lot of people want to see the BRICS fail. Western nations, in particular the United States and Britain, are prime suspects. However, there are plenty of unwitting commentators in the emerging world who are playing into the West’s hands. Each year, as the BRICS summit draws near, the cacophony from these haters grows louder. Questions about the viability and relevance of the BRICS are raised in the media. \\nDuring the build-up to the Goa summit this year, the refrain was similar but with the background buzz that the India-China rift over Pakistan-backed terrorism would derail the summit. However, the predicted outcome of an implosion didn’t materialise and, on the contrary, with India and Russia inking the S-400 missile deal , Goa 2016 turned out to be a memorable event. \\nSince many innocent readers may have been misinformed by the compromised commentators – who will certainly be back like a bounced cheque next year – here’s a ready reckoner on the BRICS group. So the next time you hear remarks that the BRICS are collapsing, don’t lose sleep over the issue. World needs BRICS \\nMost of the global multilateral institutions that exist today are no longer relevant. The IMF and the World Bank, for instance, were founded during the closing years of World War II. In geopolitical time, that’s ancient history. Similarly, the G-7 appears to be on life support and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) is no longer a leading organisation. \\nRussia, China and India must play a leading role in greater Eurasia \\nWith the western economies perched on monetary and budgetary cliffs, the five BRICS members provide a stable alternate force that offsets the West’s decline. Both China and India continue to experience high economic growth and are on course to become mega economies that will completely dwarf the West in the coming decades. Beijing’s growth may have fallen under 7 per cent but that’s enough to add the equivalent of Holland’s national income to the Chinese GDP. \\nBottom line: without the BRICS, the world economy will experience 1929 all over again. BRICS slowdown, not a meltdown \\nUday Kotak, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank, feels India should quit the BRICS coalition because of the slowdown in four of the five economies. His view has been echoed by several so-called experts. But curiously, have you ever heard any economist or banker say the OECD must disband because it has basket cases such as Greece or terror exporters such as Turkey? \\nAccording to the US-based Centre on Global Interests , “You can look at the BRICS from the financial market's point of view, or from a geopolitical point of view. But whichever lens you view it through, what you see is the same: despite economic slowdowns and even economic hardship in some nations, these are far and away the most powerful countries outside of the developed core. Their economies have scale. Their decisions can move financial markets. They have intellectual capital and clout within their regions. And in terms of foreign policy, they are the counterweight to a unipolar world run largely by Washington and its friends in London and Brussels.” \\nIt adds: “In both of these regards – economics and foreign policy – the BRICS are alive and kicking. In fact, they are more relevant today than they were in November 2001, when Jim O'Neill grouped them into the strange bedfellows that they have become.” Bilaterals can’t bring down the BRICS \\nIf the UN fails to discuss relevant political issues, the international body is considered a failure. But BRICS is not a platform that was created for discussing politics. The primary role of the five-member group is to remove the West’s grip from the levers that control the world economy. By establishing their own New Development Bank, the BRICS have ensured that the IMF is no longer the world’s lender-of-last-resort. \\nIn this backdrop, fears that bilateral issues involving India and China will wreck summits have consistently proved to be baseless. \\nIt’s time for BRICS to go on political overdrive \\nTake Goa 2016. While the Goa Declaration mentions terror, the focus of the summit was not terrorism at all. Sure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a shot at Pakistan, describing it as the “mothership of terrorism”, and China defended its ally by saying it had made “great sacrifices”. But both New Delhi and Beijing were merely playing to their respective galleries even as the real summitry was happening behind closed doors. \\nTo be sure, politics can be tabled if it’s a side dish – like Syria was a couple of years ago – but issues with the potential to derail the summit simply have no place in BRICS. \\nCritics of the BRICS often point to the India-China border issue as evidence of serious problems. But this misses the point. There always will be different opinions and views among the BRICS countries – just like there are differences among NATO or European Union members. BRICS are not united but it doesn’t matter \\nUnlike NATO or the European Union, where the member countries have more or less the same goals and are also of the same racial stock, each of the BRICS countries is different. However, their membership of BRICS gives them a common goal – development. As emerging countries, they are focussed on raising their standards of living. \\nThe fact that they are united as a group, despite such stark differences in national goals, opinions and geopolitical rivalries and even outright hostilities, points to the viability of the BRICS.

       " [\"President Trump Has Shattered Jews' American Idyll      : Information\",\n",
       "  ' Trump Camp Accused Of Anti-Semitism President Trump Has Shattered Jews\\' American Idyll November 14, \" Haaretz \" - American Jews have transformed virtually overnight from insiders to outsiders; the appointment of ex-Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon, an accused anti-Semite, as chief strategist, is bound to exacerbate the tensions.\\nBy Chemi Shalev WASHINGTON \\x96 Those were the best of times, arguably, but these may be the worst of times. That\\x92s the way most American Jews must feel as they wake up with a massive hangover from the shock election results and the reality that Donald Trump will soon be President of the United States.\\nWhatever differences American Jews may have had with Barack Obama over the Iran nuclear deal and Middle East peace, they\\x92ve never had a president who was more in tune with their Jewish and liberal essence.\\nObama was the realization of the American Jewish vision of a multicultural society, a dream come true for a generation of civil rights activists. He promoted and embodied the liberal ideals that American Jews are more attached to than any other religious group in America. And he was more knowledgeable about American Jewish culture and Yiddishkeit than any previous president, bar none. Even when they disagreed with him, most American Jews, with the exception of the vocal minority that hated his guts, viewed Obama as a mensch.\\nIt is probably no coincidence that during his tenure, American Jews reached a pinnacle of social and cultural acceptance. Being American Jews was hip. It was cool. It was the thing to be. From Jon Stewart to Jerry Seinfeld, from Joe Lieberman to Bernie Sanders, Jews seemed to be more entrenched than ever before in the American mainstream. Pew Research Polls repeatedly confirmed that Jews were the most loved and most admired religious group in all of America. Mashiach-zeit, old timers would say, but with a note of caution, because if Jewish history teaches anything, it is that all things must pass.\\nThe election of Donald Trump has shattered the Jewish idyll, all across the board. Although one must give the president-elect the benefit of the doubt that he is not an anti-Semite himself, he has frequently promoted disparaging Jewish stereotypes in his personal statements. Sunday evening\\x92s appointment of former Breitbart CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist in the White House is bound to exacerbate Jewish tensions. He is considered the standard bearer for the racist, anti-immigrant alt-right movement and has been accused of harboring anti-Semitic sentiments himself.\\nTrump has repeatedly and unapologetically disseminated white supremacist tweets. His campaign has used anti-Semitic symbols that Trump has failed to disown even when advised of their offensive content. He has distanced himself from his neo-Nazi supporters only under duress. And under his wings, America has seen an unprecedented outburst of blunt and naked hatred of Jews, which has only gotten worse since his election.\\nIn recent months, most prominent Jewish journalists and other public critics of Trump have been harassed by anti-Semites on social media, in their mail at home and, in some cases, in close physical contact. Swastikas have been painted at schools. Jewish students have been threatened, taunted, told that Adolf Hitler was right all along. Along with Muslims, Hispanics, and African Americans, they are being targeted as the sworn enemies of the America First Weltanschauung that Trump is bringing with him to the White House.\\nThe shock that many Jews are feeling now is partly of their making. In recent years, the American Jewish establishment has willingly enlisted in the Israeli government\\x92s effort to depict ever-widening circles of anti-Israeli agitation on the left as anti-Semitism. The fight against BDS and the efforts to portray it as hatred of Jews in another form has consumed the time, energy and resources of the American Jewish leadership, with the possible exception of the Anti-Defamation League.\\nMeanwhile, virulent and classic anti-Semitism lurking just under the radical right\\x92s surface was virtually ignored, concealed by the mainstream right-wing\\x92s overwhelming support for Israel. Even mentioning it was considered to be an anti-Israeli provocation.\\nTrump\\x92s triumph has unleashed the pent up resentment against Jews. His reluctance to tackle manifestations of racism and white supremacism among his supporters has energized and empowered it. If he and his advisers don\\x92t take assertive steps soon, anti-Jewish agitators will feel they have a license from the White House to do as they please. They will get bolder, grow stronger, recruit new adherents and increasingly resort to violence: we\\x92ve seen it before.\\nBut even if brazen anti-Semitic incidents are quelled or die down by themselves, there is no denying that Jews have transformed virtually overnight from insiders to outsiders. Not only did they vote overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prominent conservative Jews who could have allayed their concerns are the ones who have distanced themselves from Trump over the course of the campaign and will play no role in his administration.\\nAmerican Jewish liberals are bound to feel alienated from their own government in way they\\x92ve never felt before. Most of the values, goals and policy objectives of the Trump administration, even if they turn out to be a paler and more palatable version of his campaign rhetoric, are diametrically opposed to those of most American Jews. They support immigration, pluralism, multiculturalism, social reform, government intervention, separation of church and state, gay marriage, abortion rights and on and on. It is easy to see, in fact, why so many of Trump\\x92s radical supporters would view the Jews as their mortal enemies.\\nAs Shmuel Rosner rightly points out for the wrong reasons, Trump may ultimately divide Israeli and American Jews. But the reason for that is not limited, as Rosner asserts, to the yet to be proven assumption that American Jews will resent their Israeli counterparts for liking Trump because he is pro-Israel. It is because Trump\\x92s core message, his reactionary, nativist, chauvinistic, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant and mainly anti-Muslim worldview is shared by far too many, though far from all Israelis, and is embraced by its ruling coalition. And because many Israeli Jews are indifferent to right-wing anti-Semitism and indeed share right-wing disdain toward the liberalism of American Jews.\\nOf course, all may not be bleak. Perhaps Trump will fight the anti-Semitism on his radical fringe with increasing vigor. Possibly his policies will be less offensive to American Jews. Perhaps the American Jewish establishment will produce a leadership capable of meeting these trying times. Who knows, maybe some American Jews will finally realize they should support Israeli Jews who share their worldview rather than a government that doesn\\x92t.\\nAnd if worse comes to worst, to paraphrase Casablanca, liberal American Jews will always have Israel itself. Moderate, liberal Israelis, beleaguered and on the point of despair, will flock to the airport to welcome them with open arms. Mashiach-zeit, they will tell themselves, in awe.

Things were safer then, and the economy was strong—it was just a better time. But it’s all gone downhill ever since.

       " ['Republican Leader Now Proposes Taking Away Seniors’ Healthcare; Blames Obama – New Century Times',\n",
       "  'Share on Facebook \\nPresident Obama is just weeks away from leaving office. Our biggest nightmare, backed by a fully Republican Congress, is about to take over. What that means, other than a far more hateful environment throughout the nation, is that a lot of people will lose a lot. Millions will lose healthcare. They don’t care. The national parks could be put on the auction block. They don’t care. Republicans have already started stripping seniors of their healthcare, and don’t let them try to sell you on the benefits of privatization. There aren’t any. \\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan appeared on Special Report on Fox with Bret Baier. Ryan, now that he has a Republican in the White House, is set to start right away repealing the Affordable Care Act even Medicare. Well, he wants to privatize Medicare. \\n“Your solution has always been to put things together, including entitlement reform,” says Baier, using Republican code for privatizing Medicare. Ryan replies, “If you’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, you have to address those issues as well. … Medicare has got some serious issues because of Obamacare. So those things are part of our plan to replace Obamacare.” \\nRyan tells Baier, “Because of Obamacare, Medicare is going broke.” This is false. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of the truth. The Medicare trust fund has been extended 11 years as a result of the passage of Obamacare, whose cost reforms have helped bring health care inflation to historic lows. It is also untrue that repealing Obamacare requires changing traditional Medicare. But Ryan clearly believes he needs to make this claim in order to sell his plan, or probably even to convince fellow Republicans to support it. \\nSource: Reverb Press \\nHere’s the video: \\nRyan, as usual, has it completely backwards. The Affordable Care Act is keeping Medicare afloat. Medicare is also solvent until 2028 and it’s an easy fix to keep it solvent beyond that. \\nHealth reform, along with other factors, has significantly improved Medicare’s financial outlook, boosting revenues and making the program more efficient. The HI trust fund is now projected to remain solvent 11 years longer than before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. And the HI program’s projected 75-year shortfall of 0.73 percent of taxable payroll is much less than the 3.88 percent of payroll that the trustees estimated before health reform. (See Figure 1.) This means that Congress could close the projected funding gap by raising the Medicare payroll tax — now 1.45 percent each for employers and employees — to about 1.8 percent, or by enacting an equivalent mix of program cuts and tax increases. \\nSource: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \\nWhat privatization would mean to seniors is that instead of direct coverage, they would get subsidies from which seniors would have to buy their own insurance. Now, let’s forget for a moment that the subsidies will probably not be enough to pay for private coverage, which is much, much more expensive, but if the Affordable Care Act is overturned, it will mean that preexisting conditions will be back. It’s a rare senior (or person) who doesn’t have at least one preexisting condition. In other words, privatizing Medicare will be a huge giveaway to insurance companies, but seniors will be screwed.

       " ['Breaking: Julian Assange Just Confirmed… Department Of Justice Told Hillary To Delete All Evidence | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'VIA Conservative Daily Post In an email sent to Cheryl Mills from John Podesta the evening of March 2, 2015, hours after the New York Times reported that Clinton possibly violated federal record requirements by using the private server, a shocking revelation has been uncovered. According to the latest batch of Podesta’s hacked emails, Podesta writes, “Not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later.” Mills responded, “Think you just got your new nick name.” The “Lanny” reference is to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to former President, Bill Clinton. Lawyers, unfortunately, are not always the most honest individuals and have been known to cover up for their guilty clients. Hillary Clinton is one of these lawyers. Cheryl Mills is the same woman who oversaw the controversial construction of a South Korean sweat shop being built in Haiti. A week after this email exchange took place, Hillary Clinton announced that she would love nothing more than to share her emails with the general public, claiming she had nothing to hide. At least, she didn’t think she did. After being subpoenaed by federal court, Hillary Clinton acid-washed her private server, deleting thousands of emails. She denied, under oath, that classified information was ever on the server or sent/discussed via her private email address. Acid-washing a server costs a pretty penny. If she truly had nothing to hide, why did she completely bleach her server free of everything? Thanks to leaked emails from WikiLeaks, it has been proven that Hillary lied when she said no classified information had ever been involved with her private server- Not only was there classified information stored and talked about, but hackers were able to intercept the data and correspondence. New York Post comments, “Democrats on the House Oversight Committee point to Clinton tweeting on March 4, 2015, calling on the State Department to release her 55,000 pages of work files.” “I want the public to see my email,” Hillary wrote two days after the Podesta message. At the time, the real Lanny Davis was in support of Clinton addressing her emails. Another WikiLeaks email displays members of the Clinton Organization getting frustrated with Davis’ public voicing. “We gotta zap Lanny out of our universe,” campaign manager Robby Mook wrote Podesta March 8, 2015. “Can’t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.” Good thing for Lanny Davis, “zap” doesn’t equate to “wet-work.” Although Davis may have been rash to announce and support Hillary Clinton’s innocence, the DNC had major issues with it. Davis told Fox News host Chris Wallace, during a televised interview, about Hillary Clinton’s private email server- “there can be a neutral party to review all these records – nothing unlawful.” Apparently, Davis wasn’t given the memo by Hillary Clinton’s team regarding her bleached server and it’s true contents. “I think it is a reasonable idea if anybody has any doubts that there’s a delete on a hard drive- to have an independent go inspect her private e-mail?” Davis added. Hillary Clinton is known for lying, her own chairman doesn’t even believe her when she claims she “forgets” things. \\nEVEN PODESTA KNOWS SHE IS A LIAR! Hillary Clinton wouldn’t know honesty if it slapped her in the face. She is a psychopathic liar that thirsts for ways to obscenely scam on a global spectrum. She calls out Donald Trump for “using the system” but in no way has he abused the system in the grand scale that the Clintons have. He’s a business man, he was simply following the laws that government had implemented. Floods of emails and documents are being leaked every day by Anonymous, WikiLeaks and the FBI. These are desperate cries for help mostly from whistle blowers who have been intimately involved with the government, trying to warn American citizens of certain madness and despair that awaits us if Hillary Clinton wins presidency. Donald J. Trump genuinely cares for the American people. He is a natural leader, he enjoys helping people because he believes in bettering America, not policies that encourage ‘pay for play’. Hillary Clintons transparency is starting to become blurred. Shatter the busted deception and lock everyone involved with the Clinton scandals in prison. Donald Trump recognizes the need for America to rebuild, which starts with depleting government corruption and replacing government officials. This is something Hillary could never accomplish. Hillary Clinton would just hire her friends and abuse her position of power, as she’s done for nearly four decades. John Podesta suggested that Hillary Clinton delete her emails- he must believe she is capable of worse than sharing classified information and as president of the United States, who would stop her from committing even more crime? She would put each and every one of our lives on the line and not think twice. Do you think Hillary Clinton ever gets tired of lying, each lie covering up the next? And even Podesta don’t believe her! Why should America? \\nIf you haven’t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment... '],\n",

       " ['PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall Street',\n",
       "  'November 3, 2016 By Shawn Helton 1 Comment \\nShawn Helton 21st Century Wire \\nThe cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street. \\nAs the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton ’s email server case – the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week. \\nThe financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Let’s take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago… \\n‘MONEY CHANGERS’– Wall Street’s Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clinton’s and The Clinton Foundation. (Photo illustration 21WIRE) \\nThe Clintons & Goldman Sachs \\nWhile campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street. \\nAt the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachs… \\nIn 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton,” received the largest share of his financial support–at least $2.6 million–from lawyers and lobbyists,” and that Clinton also received additional support from “…big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm: $98,700.” \\nFor decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits: \\n“Over 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation’s charitable programs.” \\nBy now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades. \\nThe real watershed moment came here… \\nBLANK CHECK: Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. \\n‘Key to the Kingdom’ \\nIn one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely. \\nThe Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act , which banking luminaries cynically named the “ Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999″ officially titled the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act . The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors – the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the ‘shadow banking’ realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked. \\nSimply put: Clinton’s repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking – which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite – which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that, “My husband did so well with the economy.” Really? \\nIn a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post , Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990’s: \\n“To grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband’s years in office.” \\nPrins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled “ It Takes a Pillage : Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.” \\nPrins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world. \\nThe media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the ‘Citi-Travelers Act’ on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration’s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: \\n“Then, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act , but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup’s co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut.” \\nAt the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal , as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther . In 1999 , after “12 attempts in 25 years,” Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act , which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. \\nThe repeal of Glass-Steagall was pushed heavily by Citigroup’s co-CEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation : \\n“They laid out more than $290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than $150 million in the 1997–98 election cycle—a figure sure to be topped in 1999–2000.” \\nHow much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House? \\nIn 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events. \\nIn 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of $675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said “s he sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director,” according to a quote obtained by Politico . Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October , the Democratic nominee believes in “both a public and a private position” on Wall Street reform and that it is an “ oversimplification” to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis. \\nThat Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but it’s only the tip of a much larger iceberg. \\nIn 2015, the Washington Post reported that “Hillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid.” \\n‘ANOINTED’: Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachs-backed hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky. \\nThe Clinton family is chock-full of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton ‘joined’ the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a “…$12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns.” Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky , a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelsea’s tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 2006-2008 just prior to Hillary Clinton’s run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation. \\nMarc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity , after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of $25 million – after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt. \\nThe apple doesn’t fall far from the tree… \\nAs it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky – another close friend of Team Clinton. \\nPolitico reports on one of Ed Mezvinsky’s financial controversies in 1999: \\n“In the waning days of Clinton’s presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa), who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly $10 million money from other investors to cover his losses. “ \\nContinuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinsky’s wife to then President Bill Clinton: \\n“…records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his then-wife — ex-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.) — pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case.” \\nIn 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following: “Chelsea Clinton’s husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds. Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised $25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation. That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times , and will now be closed.” \\n‘THE INSIDERS’– A ground-breaking ceremony at Goldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan in 2005. Hillary Clinton is joined by Michael Bloomberg , Lloyd Blankfein (current Goldman Sachs CEO), Former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson. (Image Source: ilovemyfreedom ) \\nThe NY Times further outlined the long-held Clinton/Goldman connection just two years before the 2007-2008 financial crisis: “The Clintons’ relationships with Wall Street deepened in the 2000s, when Mr. Clinton set up his foundation in Harlem and Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York. That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York — and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of $234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site.” ‘HOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCE’– Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. (Image Source: sputniknews ) The Wall Street Racket To understand who powers the Clinton Foundation’s billion dollar RICO influence-peddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for $5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following: \\n“Goldman Sachs will pay $5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the bank’s sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday. \\nAuthorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and $875 million to resolve various other claims. \\nThis resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,” acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement .” \\nIn 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 2007-2008 economic crisis: \\n“Whether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the $10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson [ former Goldman alum] pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley—but not Lehman Brothers—to become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise $10 billion in equity, $5 billion from the public and another $5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Fed’s expedited decision and support. (A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a $9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.)” \\nAll told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs (after making record profits) became the fifth mega-bank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 2007-2008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 – not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession. \\nIn a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 2007-2008: \\n“Data gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project , a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009.” \\n‘CASHING OUT’– Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. (Image Source: St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) \\nWall Street Selects ‘Team Clinton’ \\nThe Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990’s as Robert Rubin , a former senior partner with Goldman (with a 26-year tenure with the firm), joined former President Clinton’s economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the ‘Rubinomics’ banner (aka Clintonomics), the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class , in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time. \\nAccording to Congressional record ( Vol.146 part 2 ), “In 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5% – Clinton’s vetoes of spending cuts [insured] continued deficits well into the 21st Century.” \\nIn a Multinational Monitor report entitled “Wall Street’s Best Investment: Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown,” by Robert Weissman and James Donahue , a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990’s under the Clinton administration was revealed: \\n“During the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that “the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933. … U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by Glass-Steagall has eroded significantly.” \\nWith a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group , Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup (1999-2009) after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of Glass-Steagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 2007-2008 crash. Here’s a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse: \\n“When it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything. “You have to view people in a fair light,” says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton-era prosperity. “But on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.” \\n‘SWORN’– FBI director James Comey sworn in by former DOJ head Eric Holder. (Image Source: thewhitehousespin ) \\nUnder the Microscope \\nOver the summer 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey , as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Here’s the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: \\n“Many will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank – a bank implicated in international money laundering , including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels. Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: \\n“If Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations.” \\nIn 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling $81 million in donations from clients of the large bank: \\n“The charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as $81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBC’s controversial Swiss bank. \\nLeaked files from HSBC’s Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva.” \\nA new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week. It remains to be seen how in-depth this new investigation will be. \\nTo call it collusion would be an understatement. When looking back at the financial affairs of the Clintons, Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street – it’s clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate. \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV Filed Under: Featured , Shawn Helton , US News Tagged With: 2016 Election , Clinton Foundation , Clinton Global Initiative , FBI , Goldman Sachs , Hillary Clinton , Trump Analyze_This_88 \\nSo looks like Goldman Sachs Blankfein bankrolled Chelsea Clinton’s husband, no doubt another payoff for the Clintons loyalty to the Wall Street criminal banking cartel..

       "  'Share on Twitter The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \\nDonald Trump told an invitation-only audience of 700 supporters in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday that if elected, he will offer a “new deal for black America.” \\nHe rolled out the plan wrapped in three promises . \\n“I want to talk about how to grow the African American middle class and to provide a new deal for black America. That deal is grounded in three promises — safe communities, great education, and high paying jobs.” \\nOf those promises, he said, in part: \\n1. Safe Communities \\n\"Making our communities safe again will be a priority. You walk to the store to buy a loaf of bread maybe with your child and you get shot. We got to stop it. \\n[T]he law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. We will also police our streets—have to keep our streets safe. \\nThe problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. We need really a great group of people to keep you safe, to keep us all safe.\" \\n2. Education \\n\"School choice is at the center of my plan. And by the way we’re going to terminate common core and bring education local. \\nMy proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice.\" \\n3. Jobs \\n\"When we stop off-shoring to low wage countries, we raise wages at home meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable. \\nI will also propose tax holidays for inner city investments, a new tax incentive to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. \\nI will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities.\" \\nTrump has repeatedly asked America\\'s blacks “what do you have to lose?” On Wednesday, he once again explained why minorities should reject Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. \\n“We keep electing the same people over and over and over and they keep coming back to the African American community and the Hispanic community and they keep talking about what they’re going to do and they don’t do it and four years later you see them again.” \\nBased on a CBS News poll released last week, Trump has a steep hill to climb with less than two weeks to go — he received support from just 4 percent of likely black voters.

       " ['Why Everyone on Facebook Is Checking into Standing Rock, North Dakota',\n",
       "  \"Pin 1 \\n( ANTIMEDIA ) When it comes to brute force, law enforcement and private security currently have the upper hand on the ground in Standing Rock, North Dakota. They’re employing armored vehicles, riot gear, tasers, rubber bullets, pepper spray, sound cannons, and other shows of force against peaceful opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. \\nBut unlike most of the corporate media, the Internet is taking note of the struggle at Standing Rock and is trying to do its part to contribute to the protests. Over the weekend, unconfirmed reports emerged that police were using Facebook check-ins at Standing Rock to track individuals who arrived at the location to join water protectors. \\nAs word spread of the apparent news, the Internet stepped up to neutralize the power of the police-surveillance state. \\nShortly after, Facebook users from around the country and world began checking into Standing Rock, which registers as Cannon Ball, North Dakota, in an effort to confuse police. According to a statement many posters are copying and pasting: \\n“ The Morton County Sheriff’s Department has been using Facebook check-ins to find out who is at Standing Rock in order to target them in attempts to disrupt the prayer camps. SO Water Protectors are calling on EVERYONE to check-in at Standing Rock, ND to overwhelm and confuse them. This is concrete action that can protect people putting their bodies and well-beings on the line that we can do without leaving our homes. “ \\nOthers merely checked in while still others added their own commentary. “ If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor ,” wrote Patrick Quinn below his check-in. \\n“ Messing with fascists ,” Luba Petrusha commented. \\nWhile the troll effort is exciting, it’s unclear whether the efforts are having an effect. According to Snopes, a self-described fact-checking blog whose conclusions are generally reliable , police claim they are not using Facebook to track protesters. Snopes reported “ [a Morton County] officer explained not only that they were not using Facebook check-ins as a gauge of anything, but that the metric presented no intelligence value to them. The rumor suggested that protesters cited Facebook check-ins as a manner in which police could target them, but check-ins were voluntary — and if police were using geolocation tools based on mobile devices, remote check-ins would not confuse or overwhelm them.” Sign up for the free Anti-Media newsletter the establishment doesn't want you to receive \\nSnopes also claimed it spoke to protesters within a large camp at Standing Rock who said they did not issue a call to Internet users to check in. Nevertheless, they reportedly said they appreciated the show of solidarity. \\nRegardless of whether or not the online check-ins have any effect, the Internet has played a decisive role in the developing events in North Dakota. Livestreams have documented serious violations of free speech and the right to protest, and Facebook was accused of blocking such footage on at least one occasion. Amid the ongoing lack of mainstream coverage , the independent media has successfully drawn attention to the Standing Rock protests. \\nConsidering the establishment has come out in full force in North Dakota, from their use of surveillance to their haphazard employment of heavily armed police, the increasing number of check-ins at Standing Rock shows just how much technology empowers people. \\nEven if police aren’t scouring social media and the check-ins fail to produce any tangible result, the rapid mobilization of efforts highlights a growing sense of opposition to unjust and exploitative power — and thanks to the Internet, the world is watching. \\nThis article ( Here’s Why Everyone on Facebook Is Checking into Standing Rock, North Dakota ) is free and open source.

The B\\'nai Brith immediately publicized the offensive content of the post to introduce a concerted smear and disinformation campaign implying falsely that Dr. Hall seeks to \"Kill All Jews.\" The B\\'nai Brith exploited its grotesque misrepresentation of Dr. Hall\\'s academic work to call on its membership to flood the administrative offices of the University of Lethbridge with letters and petition signatures. The object is to remove Dr. Hall from his teaching post. Dr. Hall remains a tenured full professor whose career as a university teacher began in 1982.\\nThe University of Lethbridge\\'s administration soon surrendered to this Zionist campaign aimed at disabling an outspoken critic of Israel\\'s genocidal treatment of the Aboriginal Palestinians. On Oct. 4 the U of L president, Dr. Mike Mahon, suspended Dr. Hall without pay. He undertook this assault on the principles of academic freedom in the complete absence of any due process of third-party arbitration whatsoever.\\nThe attack on Dr. Hall is an attack on the institution of academic tenure, a mainstay of protection for academic freedom in institutions of higher learning.

       "  'Home / News / The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president fisher 1 min ago News Comments Off on The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president The African voters in the US who want Donald Trump as their president In less than 48 hours, Americans will go to the polls to elect a new president. But no matter what happens on election day (Nov. 8), Trump will not win the majority of the black vote. Many of them are expected to heed the message of president Obama who has warned that the Republican candidate will undo his administration’s legacy. But Trump ’s message—to make America great again—might still draw an unlikely group of supporters from within the black community: African immigrants. Foreign-born Africans make up a small share of the US immigrant population, but their numbers have been doubling every decade since 1970. African immigrants living in the US grew from 80,000 in 1970 to 1.8 million as of 2013, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. This group of voters say they are supporting Trump because of a blend of ideals that his candidacy represents: as the new flag bearer for conservative, traditional politics; a political outsider who has chipped away at political correctness; a successful businessman who has consistently reinvented himself to achieve the American dream; and a man sure to deliver them from what they see as the disappointing presidency of Barack Obama . Despite Trump ’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, some African immigrants have been dissatisfied with Obama ’s middling Africa policy and think real change from an outsider like themselves could make a positive difference for America their own fortunes. Leading this pack is none other than president Obama ’s Kenyan half-brother, Malik. The 58-year-old naturalized US citizen, has spoken about his own brother’s leadership as “deep disappointment,” and said that Trump was “providing something new and something fresh” to the American people. Some of the African Trump supporters like Malik have also voiced their concerns about the moral relativism that has pervaded US politics, from abortion rights to marriage equality, to the current debate on transgender bathroom use. I tried to co-exist with my brother Barack Obama but he shut me out; In his Ivory Tower. I gave up. — Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) November 5, 2016 VOTE FOR MR. TRUMP ! Malik already voted. — Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) November 5, 2016 Reno Omokri, once the controversial new media aide to Nigeria’s former president, Goodluck Jonathan, is now a pastor in the San Francisco Bay area. Speaking to the BBC, Omokri said that he supports Trump because he was going to nominate a Supreme Court judge who might reverse, or deal, with these issues from a conservative standpoint. “Those issues, they might seem small to you,” Omokri said, but they “are very important to someone like me because I am a conservative and that is why I am supporting Donald Trump .” Khadra Abdirahman is a 24-year-old Somali-American who was born in New York after her parents fled the civil war in Somalia. But as a registered Republican and a first-time voter, she intends to cast her ballot for a political candidate who is against the status quo. Establishment party leaders she said, are oblivious to the populism born out of frustration, which is why she would vote for a candidate like Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders, instead of Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush. Abdirahman, who didn’t support Obama when he ran in 2008 and 2012, thinks the 2016 elections are “a change election” and a “revolutionary election.” She says the “surge of anti-establishment, anti-globalist political revolutions,” the like we have seen with Brexit, should provide the space for candidates like Trump to be elected. “America projects a false image of goodness and truthfulness and it is actually extremely rotten to the core.” Sign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.

My son’s wanted to go there forever, and I feel really good about the amount of cash I sent them, so hopefully I have a decent shot.

For many of us with young children, you probably woke up this morning asking yourself, “How am I supposed to explain this to my children?” \\n\\nI, Melania Trump, am asking myself the same thing. \\n\\nHow can any of us metabolize what happened to a ten-year-old? Should I be honest and let him know just how bad things are, or do I let him enjoy his childhood, his innocence a little while longer? How much longer can we pretend the bathroom door lock is “broken” while Donald is stuck in there? \\n\\nMany of us are concerned about how our sons will learn to treat women in this dangerous, sexist climate. In the case of my son, the nation’s biggest tragedy since 9/11 just told him to stop being a pussy. \\n\\nHow am I supposed to explain that our next president is a bully, and also his father? \\n\\n\\nAnd how do I explain to my son that our next president is a man who intimidatingly looked over at my ballot, just to make sure I was still voting for him? Should I remind my son that this man is a terrible role model and his behavior unacceptable, just like I’ve been quietly whispering to him for his entire short life? \\n\\nAnd when he gets older, how am I supposed to tell them how this all began? That their father admitted to sexual assault, never shared his tax returns, was endorsed by the KKK, and still somehow weaseled his way into the presidency without even winning the popular vote? I used to believe that this country was an equal playing field where anyone can make it with hard work, but now I’m not so sure. I hate that my son has to come of age in such a time of uncertainty and also have blood relation to the cause of it all. \\n\\nWhat am I supposed to tell my only son about the loud, nasty man on TV who insults immigrants while hiring thousands of them, including me, his wife? Do I need to tell him anything at all when he is on the TV standing right next to that man? \\n\\nIt seems like it’s always on the tip of my tongue these days; that “Donald Trump is a bad man.” But I can’t bring myself to tell him. Mostly because a man said he’d “send me back to Slovenia” if I did. But in my heart, I am concerned for the future of our country.

       " ['Crossing the Acheron: Back to Vietnam',\n",
       "  'Email \\nIn classical mythology, the Acheron is one of the rivers of the Underworld. It marks the boundary between the living and the dead. The ferryman Charon ferries the dead across the Acheron to a place where they lose memory. Nothing of what made them human remains—happiness, suffering, love, hatred, guilt, regret, redemption, betrayal, forgiveness. \\nFrom Gilgamesh to Odysseus to Aeneas, the living heroes of the epic descend into the Underworld at a point of despair in the sense of their quest. Burdened by a fate that requires momentous courage and tragic self-sacrifice for the sake of their people’s survival, they resent the absurdity of their lot. Down there on a visit, they return from the shadow land strengthened. They recognize that the business of living is not oblivion but action. \\nJohn Marciano’s recently published book, The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commemoration ? functions as such a Charon in reverse. It ferries readers back to the realm of remembering. This slim volume could not have come at a more opportune moment. American political culture is punch-drunk with the pursuit of war. The altered state is reaching the point of delirium tremens. Thwarted in the neocolonial scheme of annexing Syria by Russia’s legal intervention, the American elite are pushing for confrontation. Though it is hard to think the unthinkable, the nuclear holocaust may happen if not by intention then by spontaneous combustion from over-intoxication with the fumes of war. \\nThis reckless confrontation results from decades of accumulated unaccountable power. Its boldness reflects a cumulative experience of impunity for aggressive behavior by soft and hard neocolonial postures since the end of WW II. The war in Vietnam, as Marciano suggests, should have functioned as the lesson that checked the nation’s historical thrust for conquest, but the turning point would have required a national effort to relinquish the myth of the Noble Cause, the delusion that America is vested with a divine mandate to assimilate the people of the world to the American image–for the people’s own good. Britain had its White Man’s Burden; France its mission civilatrise ; America its Manifest Destiny. \\nThis timely volume traces the war to the apocalyptic finale of the most powerful military in the world defeated by the determination, courage, and self-sacrifice of a peasant people unwilling to be enslaved. But this is as much a book about the past as it is about the present. It reminds us, with Tolstoy, “The reality of war is in the killing, “ a realization officialdom would like to block. In fact, they have prepared a falsifying celebration of that moral and military debacle. \\nAs Marciano writes in his introduction, \\n“In May 2012, President Barack Obama and the Pentagon announced a Commemoration of the Vietnam War to continue through 2025, the fiftieth anniversary of the conflict’s end. Among the Commemoration’s objectives, three stand out: ‘to thank and honor’ veterans and their families . . . ‘to highlight the advances in technology, science, and medicine related to military research conducted during’ the war; and to ‘recognize the contributions and sacrifices made by the allies’.” \\nPresident Obama claimed in the commemoration announcement speech that the war had been “an honorable cause.” Marciano challenges this notion. America’s historic ideology of the Noble Cause, he writes, rests on the belief that the United States is \\n“A unique force for good in the world, superior not only in its military and economic power, but in the quality of its government and institutions, the character and morality of its people, and its way of life.” \\nThis is the mystical bigotry of a messianic faith typical of empires. Imperial militarism seeks in a Noble Cause the justification for subjugating large chunks of humanity. In the distant past, the Noble Cause may have received the sword directly from a god—as it did in postcolonial America when it sought to exterminate the native inhabitants. By the anointment of the sword, the divinity also endowed, supposedly, the conquering “race” with moral superiority. Thus, imperialism, in the perverse arrogance of its twisted psyche, contains the germ of genocide. As a result, the superstition of a superior “race” has been endured by most of the “races” on the planet as a most Ignoble Cause. In Vietnam alone, the Big Lie of the Noble Cause sent four million Vietnamese to their death. \\nMarciano leaves us in no doubt that the White House and the Pentagon are commemorating a crime. They are falsifying history in order to shape the future, which will be and is the reenactment of the war against Vietnam on a global scale. They want to establish the altar for a “sacred union,” the nation united behind the Noble Cause of war. On the altar will sit the fetish of the export of the “miracle of democracy, ” in reality the imposition of regimes of terror such as the Vietnam War planners established in Saigon. We see today in Ukraine that the “miracle of democracy,” brought to Kiev by the US in 2014 to the tune of five billion dollars, amounts to a handful of dry dust, collected from the WW II graveyard of European Nazism, inciting a lot of blind, anti-democratic and noxious nationalism. \\nAs through a glass darkly, Marciano shows us that in the war crime against Vietnam we can see reflected the crimes perpetrated today from Afghanistan to Yemen, from Iraq to Syria, from Yugoslavia to Libya and across the African continent. As in Vietnam (the fakery of the Gulf of Tonkin incident), today’s war are based on fabricated pretexts; as in Vietnam (napalm and agent orange), today’s wars are chemical wars (depleted uranium for Yugoslavia and Iraq; phosphorus for Falluja); as in Vietnam (Hanoi and Haiphong) the bombings destroy urban life, vital infrastructure, schools and hospitals; as in Vietnam (Laos, Cambodia) the bombings spreads out (today to Yemen); as in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh) the leaders who resist US penetration are demonized (Milosevic, Saddam, Qaddafi, Assad) as enemies of humanity. As in Vietnam, all the wars of today are fought mostly to prevent or reverse independence and self-determination of former colonial places. \\nFinally, as in Vietnam the USSR, today’s Russia is emerging as the displacement of all the guilt that weighs on the shoulders of the Noble Cause. The Washington Post recently wrote “the Kremlin annexed Ukraine.” I read it twice—not “annexed Crimea,” the standard disinformation, but the whole of Ukraine! Does one laugh or weep? Does one have to take a hallucinogenic to see Russian flags and images of Putin blanketing Kiev instead of Neo-Nazi emblems and images of Bandera? \\nThe next president will certainly be Hillary Clinton, whom I call “the centripetal president.” From Republicans to Democrats to Neo-Cons, all converge on endorsing the war candidate. In her consensus war regime, the elite will decide everything. We will not be consulted. This is why The American War in Vietnam: Crime or Commemoration? is a vital read. It calls for our re-democratization–to question our leaders, to be skeptical of the media, to avert our eyes from the petrifying stare of the Medusa decked with the aegis of the Noble Cause; to challenge—even ridicule– the vaunted humanitarianism of an elite of bloodhounds baying for war; to refuse to commemorate war crimes and to work to stop them. \\nAbove all, we need to remember that the crimes of other governments are the responsibility of the people of those governments—not of our bombs. Though our elite have abrogated to themselves the power and the right to remake the map of the world by force, we need to reassert the legal principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign states if we are serious about peace. We, citizens, do not have the right (or the power, unless we line up behind the power of the militarist state) to change the practices of other states, but we do have the right to demand change for those of our own. Let’s start exercising that right. We did for Vietnam; we can do it again. Commemorate the people who protested the war in Vietnam, not the crime the governing elite committed there in our name, as Marciano’s book amply documents. \\nThe US government is now engaged in waging eight wars. We better get busy. '],\n",

I want to start by thanking all of the participants in the Valdai International Discussion Club, from Russia and abroad, for your constructive part in this work, and I want to thank our distinguished guests for their readiness to take part in this open discussion. \\nOur esteemed moderator just wished me a good departure into retirement, and I wish myself the same when the time comes. This is the right approach and the thing to do. But I am not retired yet and am for now the leader of this big country. As such, it is fitting to show restraint and avoid displays of excessive aggressiveness. I do not think that this is my style in any case. \\nBut I do think that we should be frank with each other, particularly here in this gathering. I think we should hold candid, open discussions, otherwise our dialogue makes no sense and would be insipid and without the slightest interest. \\nI think that this style of discussion is extremely needed today given the great changes taking place in the world. The theme for our meeting this year, The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow , is very topical. \\nLast year, the Valdai forum participants discussed the problems with the current world order. Unfortunately, little has changed for the better over these last months. Indeed, it would be more honest to say that nothing has changed. \\nThe tensions engendered by shifts in distribution of economic and political influence continue to grow. Mutual distrust creates a burden that narrows our possibilities for finding effective responses to the real threats and challenges facing the world today. Essentially, the entire globalisation project is in crisis today and in Europe, as we know well, we hear voices now saying that multiculturalism has failed. \\nI think this situation is in many respects the result of mistaken, hasty and to some extent over-confident choices made by some countries’ elites a quarter-of-a-century ago. Back then, in the late 1980s-early 1990s, there was a chance not just to accelerate the globalisation process but also to give it a different quality and make it more harmonious and sustainable in nature. \\nBut some countries that saw themselves as victors in the Cold War, not just saw themselves this way but said it openly, took the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests. \\nIn their euphoria, they essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalisation and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this. \\nWe may as well be frank here, as we know full well that many did not agree with what was happening, but some were unable by then to respond, and others were not yet ready to respond. The result though is that the system of international relations is in a feverish state and the global economy cannot extricate itself from systemic crisis. At the same time, rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely. \\nIf the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules. \\nThus, we saw the decisions to launch airstrikes in the centre of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya. The operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favour these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defence systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos. \\nWe see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organisation and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organisation itself aside and build a new one instead. This illustrates what I just said. \\nAt the same time, some of our partners demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today. In organisations such as NATO, for example, established during the Cold War and clearly out of date today, despite all the talk about the need to adapt to the new reality, no real adaptation takes place. We see constant attempts to turn the OSCE, a crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security, into an instrument in the service of someone’s foreign policy interests. The result is that this very important organisation has been hollowed out. \\nBut they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‘Russian military threat’. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defence budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower’s interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders. \\nOf course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilisation against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. I also read analytical materials, those written by you here today, and by your colleagues in the USA and Europe. \\nIt is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. Europe alone has 300 million people. All of the NATO members together with the USA have a total population of 600 million, probably. But Russia has only 146 million. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims. \\nAnother mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police. \\nYou would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth. \\nI have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people’s choice? America is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong. \\nThe question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world? \\nSad as it is to say, there is no consensus on these issues in the world today. Maybe you have come to some common conclusions through your discussions, and I would, of course, be interested to hear them. But it is very clear that there is a lack of strategy and ideas for the future. This creates a climate of uncertainty that has a direct impact on the public mood. \\nSociological studies conducted around the world show that people in different countries and on different continents tend to see the future as murky and bleak. This is sad. The future does not entice them, but frightens them. At the same time, people see no real opportunities or means for changing anything, influencing events and shaping policy. \\nYes, formally speaking, modern countries have all the attributes of democracy: Elections, freedom of speech, access to information, freedom of expression. But even in the most advanced democracies the majority of citizens have no real influence on the political process and no direct and real influence on power. \\nPeople sense an ever-growing gap between their interests and the elite’s vision of the only correct course, a course the elite itself chooses. The result is that referendums and elections increasingly often create surprises for the authorities. People do not at all vote as the official and respectable media outlets advised them to, nor as the mainstream parties advised them to. Public movements that only recently were too far left or too far right are taking centre stage and pushing the political heavyweights aside. \\nAt first, these inconvenient results were hastily declared anomaly or chance. But when they became more frequent, people started saying that society does not understand those at the summit of power and has not yet matured sufficiently to be able to assess the authorities’ labour for the public good. Or they sink into hysteria and declare it the result of foreign, usually Russian, propaganda. \\nFriends and colleagues, I would like to have such a propaganda machine here in Russia, but regrettably, this is not the case. We have not even global mass media outlets of the likes of CNN, BBC and others. We simply do not have this kind of capability yet. \\nAs for the claim that the fringe and populists have defeated the sensible, sober and responsible minority – we are not talking about populists or anything like that but about ordinary people, ordinary citizens who are losing trust in the ruling class. That is the problem. \\nBy the way, with the political agenda already eviscerated as it is, and with elections ceasing to be an instrument for change but consisting instead of nothing but scandals and digging up dirt – who gave someone a pinch, who sleeps with whom, if you’ll excuse me. This just goes beyond all boundaries. And honestly, a look at various candidates’ platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould – the difference is slight, if there is any. \\nIt seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favour of the suzerain. \\nThis begs the question: who is actually the fringe? The expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things – stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones. \\nPeople are clearly scared to see how terrorism is evolving from a distant threat to an everyday one, how a terrorist attack could occur right near them, on the next street, if not on their own street, while any makeshift item – from a home-made explosive to an ordinary truck – can be used to carry out a mass killing. \\nMoreover, the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the past few years in Boston and other US cities, Paris, Brussels, Nice and German cities, as well as, sadly, in our own country, show that terrorists do not need units or organised structures – they can act independently, on their own, they just need the ideological motivation against their enemies, that is, against you and us. \\nThe terrorist threat is a clear example of how people fail to adequately evaluate the nature and causes of the growing threats. We see this in the way events in Syria are developing. No one has succeeded in stopping the bloodshed and launching a political settlement process. One would think that we would have begun to put together a common front against terrorism now, after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort and difficult compromises. \\nBut this has not happened and this common front has not emerged. My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results either. There were people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice. This all demonstrates an unexplainable and I would say irrational desire on the part of the Western countries to keep making the same mistakes or, as we say here in Russia, keep stepping on the same rake. \\nWe all see what is happening in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and a number of other countries. I have to ask, where are the results of the fight against terrorism and extremism? Overall, looking at the world as a whole, there are some results in particular regions and locations, but there is no global result and the terrorist threat continues to grow. \\nWe all remember the euphoria in some capitals over the Arab Spring. Where are these fanfares today? Russia’s calls for a joint fight against terrorism go ignored. What’s more, they continue to arm, supply and train terrorist groups in the hope of using them to achieve their own political aims. This is a very dangerous game and I address the players once again: The extremists in this case are more cunning, clever and stronger than you, and if you play these games with them, you will always lose. \\nColleagues, it is clear that the international community should concentrate on the real problems facing humanity today, the resolution of which will make our world a safer and more stable place and make the system of international relations fairer and more equal. As I said, it is essential to transform globalisation from something for a select few into something for all. It is my firm belief that we can overcome these threats and challenges only by working together on the solid foundation of international law and the United Nations Charter. \\nToday it is the United Nations that continues to remain an agency that is unparalleled in representativeness and universality, a unique venue for equitable dialogue. Its universal rules are necessary for including as many countries as possible in economic and humanitarian integration, guaranteeing their political responsibility and working to coordinate their actions while also preserving their sovereignty and development models. \\nWe have no doubt that sovereignty is the central notion of the entire system of international relations. Respect for it and its consolidation will help underwrite peace and stability both at the national and international levels. There are many countries that can rely on a history stretching back a thousand years, like Russia, and we have come to appreciate our identity, freedom and independence. But we do not seek global domination, expansion or confrontation with anyone. \\nIn our mind, real leadership lies in seeing real problems rather than attempting to invent mythical threats and use them to steamroll others. This is exactly how Russia understands its role in global affairs today. \\nThere are priorities without which a prosperous future for our shared planet is unthinkable and they are absolutely obvious. I won’t be saying anything new here. First of all, there is equal and indivisible security for all states. Only after ending armed conflicts and ensuring the peaceful development of all countries will we be able to talk about economic progress and the resolution of social, humanitarian and other key problems. It is important to fight terrorism and extremism in actuality. It has been said more than once that this evil can only be overcome by a concerted effort of all states of the world. Russia continues to offer this to all interested partners. \\nTo be continued. The Essential Saker: from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world $27.95 '],\n",

       "  'Comments \\nRepublicans are fond of blaming the media for their troubles, but never blaming voters for utterly rejecting their party’s platform of racism, hatred and economic inequality. To some Republican voters, it will even come as a surprise that Donald Trump loses next week’s election, but the signs were all there and here’s an excerpt from just one of the rare Fox News stories that admits it: “ ‘Sleeping Giant’ awake and roaring – early voting shows high Latino turnout “: \\nThe tens of millions of early votes cast point to strength from Democratic-leaning Latino voters, potentially giving Clinton a significant advantage in Nevada and Colorado. With more than half the votes already cast in those states, Democrats are matching if not exceeding their successful 2012 pace, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. \\nLatinos, another group that Democrats have been banking on, are turning out in larger numbers than anticipated, and they very well may be the ones who give the party’s presidential nominee the margin of victory. “We are seeing the trajectory of the election change in some states, but Democrats are also making up ground,” said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and expert in voter turnout. \\nThey don’t let Sean Hannity or Lou Dobbs on to Fox News Latino, which is probably why it actually publishes some factual stories, unlike Fox News or Fox Business, who just today had to retract an entirely false story about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. \\nMeanwhile, Univision exit polling is showing that Latinos have the same high level of regard for Hillary Clinton in Florida that they have for President Barack Obama. This level of support is considered key to the Democratic nominee’s strategy to win the Sunshine State, which would act as a firewall, closing almost all of the Republican nominee’s paths to the presidency. The Miami Herald reports : \\nHillary Clinton has hit a key marker among Florida Hispanics, according to a new poll: She’s reached the level of popularity that helped President Barack Obama win the nation’s largest battleground state in 2012. \\nSixty percent of Florida Latinos favor Clinton, the Univision News poll shows. That’s the same number that voted for Obama four years ago, according to exit polls from that election. \\nThe polls further indicate that Hillary Clinton will probably get at least 60% of the latino vote in Florida, but there’s 9% of the sample that is still not decided, so it could be much higher by the time election day finishes. \\nPolitico is reporting that the Democratic nominee’s 30-point lead amongst Latino voters in Florida isn’t just a problem for Trump, but that for the entire GOP it’s a “terrifying” prospect. For the wing of the Republican party that likes to win elections, this poll is probably invoking the moment where they see their party’s entire electoral history as the party of Lincoln flash before its eyes, which can only mean that the end of the decadently twisted Grand Old Party is near. \\nRepublicans wrote an autopsy of their party after their politics of division, hatred and the 47% blew the 2012 election, which declared the GOP dead in the water. Particularly, the report cited the Tea Party’s radical anti-immigration policies, racist dog whistles and the war on women. \\nLuckily, that spurred the rank and file GOP voters in 2016 to pick an orange zombie Presidential candidate, a man who has turned off women and latinos like a switch, and added muslims, finished off black people and finally convinced college educated voters to trust that the Democratic party is the only rational political actor that can be trusted. \\nDonald Trump’s “safe zone”– THE Fox News Network – is reporting a massive turnout in the latino communities the Republican candidate so despises. \\nNow, there is absolutely no way he can claim that the election is rigged next Tuesday night when all of the major news networks pronounce his campaign dead, and the Republican Party along with it.

He specializes in children’s birthday parties but has the skill set to perform at kindergarten graduations as well. “Leaving the hospital was the best thing I’ve ever done. Can I say that again?” said an elated Dr. Jim Smith. \\nDr. Jim Smith first became interested in becoming a Clown after suffering from extreme burnout. Catalysts included helicopter Moms, antivax Jenny Mccarthy supporters, and the general stress of saving the world. After dealing with one particularly overbearing soccer mom, he stormed out of the office ranting, “**** this noise; I can’t take this horse**** anymore!” and never returned. Using obscenities for the first time felt nothing short of liberating. \\nDr. Jim Smith’s new lifestyle is entirely different from the clinic he used to work at. Previously, he woke up at 6am sharp but now he rolls out of bed in the neighborhood of 11:30am to ensure he is prompt for lunchtime birthday contracts. “I take my responsibilities very seriously,” said Dr. Jim Smith proudly. After a solid hour of challenging work, he practices his Downward Dog poses. \\nIn spite of all the Clown perks, Jim has admittedly taken a rather large pay cut. As a pediatrician, the Doctor made $200,000.00 per year. Now he makes $17,500.00 a year if fully booked and tipped generously. However, Dr. Jim Smith says that eating Ramen noodles with his wife and kids is definitely worth the consistent joy he experiences performing slapstick routines. “Freedom really has no price tag,” said Clown Jim Smith. \\nDr. Jim Smith’s favorite part of the job is showcasing his balloon skills. “Even though the kids cry sometimes, they don’t die,” he stated enthusiastically. Creating these balloon animals has proved to be significantly more meaningful than diagnosing heart defects. \\nDr. Jim Smith sleeps soundly knowing the nurses aren’t “hunting (him) down like cattle.” Instead, parents and children alike watch him smile and laugh as if he’s the greatest entertainer in the world. He even gets to wear a red nose! And doing mime is endlessly entertaining and unpredictable too. \\nDr. Jim Smith’s old colleagues have inquired what degree is needed to become a Clown. They’ve also expressed curiosity as to whether it is a high demand skill. \\nDr. Jim Smith’s only regret is that he didn’t become a Clown sooner. 315 Shares '],\n",

       "  \"More Election Coverage New Heavy-Duty Voting Machine Allows Americans To Take Out Frustration On It Before Casting Ballot The new Citadel voting machines can withstand up to 40 voters an hour getting a running start from a dozen yards outside the booth, leaping at full speed, and jump-kicking them directly in the screen. Close The new Citadel voting machines can withstand up to 40 voters an hour getting a running start from a dozen yards outside the booth, leaping at full speed, and jump-kicking them directly in the screen. NEWS November 2, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 43 · Politics · Election 2016 \\nWASHINGTON—Saying the circumstances of this year’s presidential race made the upgrade necessary, election commissions throughout the country were reportedly working to install new heavy-duty voting machines this week that will allow Americans to physically take out their frustrations on the devices before casting their votes. \\nAccording to Premier Election Solutions, the manufacturer of the new Citadel electronic voting machine, each unit features an easy-to-navigate interface, keeps accurate and secure tallies of votes, and is constructed with durable Kevlar buttons, a shatter-resistant Plexiglas screen, and a reinforced titanium housing, ensuring the devices are able to endure sustained blunt force trauma from voters’ fists and elbows as well as repeated puncturing attempts from sharp objects wielded by exasperated citizens. \\n“These new voting machines were designed specifically with the 2016 election in mind and have been engineered to withstand everything the nation’s voters will bring at them on Election Day,” said company spokesperson Stephen Dunn, who also noted that the units’ Teflon coating makes it easy to wipe down all the sweat and saliva that will accumulate on their surface when they are being repeatedly pummeled in fits of anger. “When 18 months of disgust finally culminate inside the nation’s voting booths, these machines will be able to absorb every punch, kick, and knee drop citizens can dish out while still reliably tabulating totals for all local, state, and national races.” \\n“Like millions of other Americans, I know that I’ll be ready to unload my pent-up rage next Tuesday,” Dunn added. “And our machines will be ready too.” \\nAccording to Dunn, the Citadel underwent numerous revisions during testing, as a series of early designs proved incapable of withstanding voters’ increasing level of aggravation as the election progressed. Engineers are said to have quickly pulled their prototypes from preliminary field tests during the Virginia and Minnesota primaries upon learning the device’s original plastic housing was splintering to pieces following sharp headbutts from as few as three successive voters. \\nAdditionally, internal modifications were reportedly made after Super Tuesday to more securely solder the processor and wiring into place so the unit would maintain functionality each time it was thrown to the ground by a red-faced, screaming voter and continuously kicked for 35 minutes straight. \\nIn a later trial during the Wisconsin primary, when the Republican field had been effectively whittled down to just Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, Dunn said the design team came up with the idea to attach an aluminum baseball bat to the side of the machine with a steel cord, noting that if they didn’t provide voters with a convenient weapon, they would physically rip the unit’s legs off and beat it with those to the point of exhaustion. \\n“Our test models were really pushed to their physical limits during the New Jersey primary in June when it was more or less clear that the country would be left with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as its two choices for president,” said Dunn, explaining that the devices had to survive all-out, abusive barrages from every voter who entered their testing precincts in Passaic County. “Thankfully, we had incorporated military-grade armor plating into the machines by that point, which proved able to sustain everything from being repeatedly smashed up against a cinder-block gymnasium wall to being dragged up and then pushed down flights of church basement stairs several times in a row.” \\n“Of course, that was the night we learned we needed to make the touchscreen bulletproof, though,” Dunn continued. \\nAccording to poll workers, excitement about the new machines appears to have increased voter turnout in the general election, with early voting up by as much as 30 percent in states where the units have already been installed, forcing many polling places to institute time limits on how long voters can batter, stomp on, and bite the units in raving bouts of hysterics. \\n“It was nice to get in there and finally cast my ballot,” said 55-year-old Gordon Mulner, an early voter in Fredericksburg, VA, panting heavily as he wiped away the sheen of sweat from his brow with his raw, bleeding knuckles. “I had to wait in line a little while, but it was worth it. It felt good to make my voice heard.” \\n“I think I broke my hand,” he added. \\nAt press time, election officials were scrambling to chain the machines to precinct walls, as it became apparent they would need to prevent voters from lugging them into the parking lot and repeatedly backing over them with their cars.

Her daughter would be born without a portion of her brain, skull, and scalp. \\nDoctors predicted that the baby would survive a few hours or days, but Sonia refused to consider abortion. She tells WJLA: \\n“God made no mistake giving Angela to Rony, Elizabeth, and I. He chose us for this sacred task and we said yes to his calling. We made the commitment even before her birth. We will take care of her the rest of her life here on earth.” \\nSonia and her family welcomed baby Angela on March 23, 2014. Sonia began working to raise awareness about anencephaly, creating a Facebook page about her daughter and her “miraculous journey.” Loading Facebook Post... \\nWith the internet being what it is, however, it was only a matter of time before the horrible remarks came trickling in. \\nQuite a few commenters wrote about how they thought Angela was less than human. Some even suggested that Sonia would be doing her daughter a favor if she ended Angela\\'s life. \\nSonia says that the hateful messages bring tears to her eyes, but that she tries to move past them. However, one comment in particular drove her to respond. She recounts on Facebook what one poster wrote: \\n“Angela looks less attractive now that she is growing and gaining weight.” \\nSonia decided to reply for the daughter who could not. After pointing out that beauty lies within, she writes: \\n“I know that Angela looks different from my typical child, but she is beautiful just the way she is. ... She is full of grace and has great peace despite the struggles. She is a radiant light in the darkness in this materialistic and shallow culture that defines beauty in the pleasure of interests. She is a true picture of strength; she is a precious little girl with a beautiful soul. So this statement does not define whom Angela IS, it defines who YOU really are!” \\nIn response to those who hold her daughter\\'s life cheap, Sonia only says that they can\\'t know what it\\'s like to enjoy her daughter\\'s smiles and laughter. She tells WJLA: \\n\"Even if her life does not please some people, we can’t play God and assume the right to dictate who should live and die. If you get to spend five minutes with her, you will see that she is perfect the way she is.” \\nNow two years old, Angela has defied expectations, and her family says that they are blessed to have her with them for as long as they can. Loading Facebook Post... \\nAfter seeing how her daughter has been an inspiration to so many, Sonia knows exactly how meaningless the harsh words from strangers are. She tells NBC10 News : \\n“It is so amazing to see how many lives Angela has touched around the world. She hasn\\'t said a word, but her testimony of life and love has reached more than 50 countries. God chose Angela before she was even born. She might never walk or talk or go to school or run a marathon, but she has done more than I have ever done in my entire life.” \\nAnd despite the negative comments, Sonia knows that she gets to spend her days with a miracle.

       "  'By Top Right News on November 18, 2016 in Uncategorized \\nby Brian Hayes | Top Right News \\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump just made his decision for the nation’s highest legal official: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. \\nAnd it’s a nightmare for liberal Democrats. \\nIn fact that’s exactly what the Huffington Post called him in their flash headline moments ago… \\nJefferson Beauregard Sessions III, 69, would serve as the nation’s top law enforcement official if nominated by Trump and confirmed by his fellow members of the Senate. Sessions, an early Trump backer, is an immigration hard-liner who has been in the Senate since 1997 and previously served as attorney general for the state of Alabama. \\nSessions is as “hardline” as a conservative can get on the core issues of the Trump Agenda, and signals to Washington that Trump is dead-serious about enforcing laws against illegal immigration, enforcing voter ID and gutting the hard-left “civil rights division” at the Department of Justice. \\nSessions is a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama appointed by Ronald Reagan, and a tough prosecutor with little patience for liberal arguments, and a deep respect for the Constitution. \\nSessions is credited with crafting Trump’s entire immigration platform , released last August. His plan includes building a permanent border wall, including details on how he would make Mexico pay for it ; end birthright citizenship , overhaul the refugee program that has overwhelmed America’s heartland, enact mandatory E-Verify to block illegals from jobs, a “pause” in green card approvals to allow unemployed Americans a chance at job positions, and an increase in salaries of H1-B visa holders to stop the undercutting of wages by foreign workers. \\nAnd unlike some cutting-edge picks such as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Sessions is almost certain to win speedy confirmation as a sitting, senior Republican Senator. \\nThe official announcement from Trump’s transition team is expected later today.

       " ['BREAKING – NYPD Knows The TRUTH About Hillary, Issues Urgent Alert to Voters | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'Email Print It seems like everyone associated with the Clintons has become immune to common sense. The Obama Justice Department will not do anything to hold this woman accountable, even though far better people than her have had their careers ended over similar crimes. However, the NYPD isn’t under Clinton or Obama’s control. Erik Prince, Blackwater Founder and Former Navy Seal, told Breitbart what the NYPD’s approach might be. According to some of his well-placed sources in the NYPD, Prince told Breitbart the following: “The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making [in the Anthony Weiner investigation] but they received ‘huge push back’ from the Justice Department.” as per Breitbart . Why is the NYPD involved in the Clinton case? Well, they weren’t originally, but they made the initial discovery of the new Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Judging from the amount of information they found on the laptop, it seems the FBI and the State Department had insiders protecting Clinton. Allegedly, the criminal activity found on that laptop is enough to make Al Capone blush. “They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,” Prince said. Prince even gave some insight as to why FBI Director Comey decided to re-open the investigation. In a nutshell, the NYPD forced his hand. “The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI,” Prince said. “They said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation and you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments,’” Prince explained. “NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,” Prince elaborated. “Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife – the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years – have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have – they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton’s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.” Allegedly, some of the crimes the emails reveal include money laundering, lying, and even sex trafficking young children. The NYPD doesn’t mess around, so they have appointed a new, unbiased, prosecutor in order to investigate these claims by Erik Prince. If only Lynch’s Justice Department knew how to make unbiased appointments. The warning for the voters is simple: if Hillary Clinton is elected, there will a constitutional crisis on our hands. She may very well be the first President to be indicted before her first day in the Oval Office. If these criminal accusations are true, they will lead to such staggering events. It would make Watergate seem like a walk in the park. But, its not too late to do the right thing and avoid all of this. Vote Trump and Hillary will be where she belongs — in prison.

       "  '\\nFox News reported : \\nFive police officers and yellow caution tape surround Donald Trump’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star — or what’s left of it. \\nThe Los Angeles police say they are investigating the smashing of Trump’s star following footage that showed the sidewalk tribute was destroyed with a pickax. \\nDet. Meghan Aguilar says investigators were called to the scene before dawn Wednesday. \\nBy mid-morning, an LAPD spokesperson at the scene told FOX411 the Chamber of Commerce was sending out a crew in the hopes of getting the star repaired as soon as possible. \\n“Investigators are looking at [a] felony vandalism [charge] because of the value which the Chamber of Commerce has placed [on the star] at $2,500…” the spokesperson told us. “As soon as investigators can positively identify the suspect, which they are very sure they can do… they will go ahead and make a decision whether they want to arrest that suspect or seek a warrant.” \\nFox411 spoke with a worker from Top End Construction who told them that the damage done to Trump’s star was “probably the worst I have seen.” \\nA man named Jamie Otis has taken responsibility for the destruction, according to Deadline Hollywood, which posted a video of the man taking a pickax to Trump’s star. \\nAccording to Deadline, Otis planned to auction off the star and give the money to the 11 women who have come forward with groping allegations against Trump just weeks before the presidential election. \\nTrump has denied the groping allegations and it’s painfully obvious that they are almost assuredly politically motivated . As far as what the women get out of it, some may be politically motivated themselves and others have had their ulterior motives — money , fame, payback because Trump didn’t go to their restaurant, etc. — exposed. \\nHollywood Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Leron Gubler made it clear that his organization “intends to prosecute to the full extent of the law,” whoever is found to be responsible for the damage.” \\n“The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees,” Gubler stated. “When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark.” '],\n",

       " ['Trump’s Team May Well Clean the Syrian Sewer | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World Some of us hope that Trump will begin tracking down the ratline that led to a billion dollars of advanced American weapons that ended up in the hands of terrorists fighting in Syria and Iraq. The scale of this is no accident. There is no doubt whatsoever that along with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States picking up the bill, pumping hundreds of millions into Raytheon Corporation for TOW and Stinger missiles, the arms dealers in Ukraine, Israel and Turkey need a smackdown for their role in war crimes that have killed 400,000 Syrian civilians, according to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory. Then there is this group itself, the disinformation news services for ISIS and al Nusra, working with Reuters, to cover for war crimes and help stage murderous gas attacks on civilians. This organization and the pet pro-ISIS media, who were very much a part of the terrorist war on Syria, need to be sent to Guantanamo for a dose of that promised “much worse than waterboarding” torture. Yes, America is back in the torture business in a big way but Trump promises that this time it will be the real terrorists and not poor kidnapped cab drivers and patsys like those that filled the prisons of Poland and the torture rooms of Gadhafi’s Libya. One might question how someone as close to Israel as Trump is may be able to clean up the problems that Israel is and will continue to be at the heart of. This and other issues, the newfound love of Russia by a president elect who has surrounded himself with Russia-haters, perhaps time and a reality check will make this all clear at some time in the future. We can only hope. But we look to Syria now. The truth is a lie and up is down, or so it seems. Let’s look at Aleppo, or so we are told were one to read the Guardian or watch CNN. A humanitarian group called “White Helmets” saves civilians from massacre or is this true? What if I told you that the “White Helmets” are members of terror groups, enforcers, torturers and “beheaders” who perform impromptu “street theatre, killing babies one minute and pretending to save them the next. Again we ask, will President Trump hunt down these war criminals along with the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, will he force Turkey out of Syria or stop the slaughter of the people of Yemen by Saudi Arabia? Conversely, he has “green-lighted” Israel’s cleansing of her remaining Palestinian population, estimated at up to 55% of Israel’s citizenry. Where will they go, with American closed to immigration and expelling millions? It’s the last days of the Obama administration and the mainstream press has let out the stops. Staged photos of the “Aleppo holocaust” are everywhere, the Reuters photographs of bloodied infants and carefully quaffed “white helmet” first responders are everywhere. Of course there are no “white helmets,” not wanting to spoil that hair and makeup job. These photos have been around for years, always shifting the blame for US backed gas attacks and rocketing, with a claimed 400,000 Syrian civilians killed, on the government and their alleged “barrel bombs.” It is all too little, too late, there is nothing that can and will be done, no last minute American invasion of Syria, joining the Turks who are already there, a last ditch attempt to save the ISIS/al Nusra “head choppers” from the Russian juggernaut. With General Michael Flynn taking over as National Security Advisor for President-elect Trump, whatever else the Trump administration may or may not be able to do, Flynn knows the Syrian war. He knows who has been supplying the terrorists, that being Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and he has a well-established understanding of Russia’s role and has long made his support of Russia in Syria clear. The key to how this will turn out will be how much power Flynn will have, formerly direction of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Trump, while looking for “military types” to bolster up his own lack of background in that area, except as a student in a military prep school, had initially turned to retired Major General Paul Vallely, founder of Stand Up America, a militia group advocating the violent overthrow of the US government. Vallely has told associates that Trump shortlisted him for Vice President but was passed over. Vallely is featured in a YouTube video allegedly visiting Aleppo. There he is filmed meeting with rebel leaders, some of whom are currently members of ISIS. Some of those likely to oppose Trump’s policies in his own party, names like Graham and McCain, are alleged to have been involved in trafficking stolen oil from Iraq, dating back to as early as 2004 and continuing to this day, via ISIS. This theft of Iraqi and now Syrian crude as well, starting with the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, moved oil into Turkey by both truck and pipeline and eventually into waiting tankers, particularly Exxon and BP, loaded under the supervision of the Turkish Navy at Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. VT’s Alex Powers was there in Baghdad with Brenner and I was in Erbil. For years, up to 40% of Iraqi oil was never paid for, some passed on in bribes in Iraq, tens of millions to key members of congress while billions more laundered into the black accounts of the oil companies. There it joined the tens of billions that were spent to arm an Iraqi army that never existed and to build a nation left it ruins, but we are getting ahead of ourselves. Will the US be able to take a credible stand without bringing the Bush era criminals to the dock? Is ISIS simply a continuity of Bush era policy, Sunni and Baathist militarists loaded up with retired contract US and Israeli officers, Turkish, Saudi and Qatari spies, funded by oil companies and armed by Raytheon? Will Trump expose the “re-death” of Osama bin Laden, with a well recorded first death on December 13, 2001, even reported by Fox News in the US and a second public killing and burial at sea without a shred of evidence, obviously done as cheap political theatre. Will Trump expose 9/11 as promised even though the finger pointing at Saudi Arabia that now comes out of Washington will inexorably lead to their Israeli friends as well? Without this delve into truth, can the books ever be balanced once and for all?

       " ['NYPD Source: Weiner Laptop Has Enough Evidence “to Put Hillary ... Away for Life”',\n",
       "  'Email \\nSex crimes with children, child exploitation, money laundering, perjury, and pay to play, reads the partial list of crimes that, claim New York City Police Department sources, could “put Hillary and her crew away for life.” \\nShocking evidence of such criminality has been found on ex-congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop computer, claim the sources, which was seized from him by NYC officials investigating his allegedly having sent sexually explicit texts to a 15-year-old girl. Moreover, Hillary Clinton’s “crew” supposedly includes not just close aide and confidante Huma Abedin and her husband, Weiner, but other aides and insiders — and even members of Congress. According to True Pundit : NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: • Money laundering • Sex crimes with minors (children) • Perjury • Pay to play through Clinton Foundation • Obstruction of justice • Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a [sic] NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.” \\nThese allegations, if true, could explain why Director Comey reopened the investigation into Clinton’s mishandling of classified information, a move that shook the political world and caused Comey to come under fire. As the NYPD chief put it, the new e-mails contents truly are “alarming.” \\nTrue Pundit also says that, according to FBI sources, both Abedin and Weiner are trying to cut immunity deals with federal officials and that, if they didn’t cooperate, they’d face long prison sentences. Abedin’s turning state’s evidence would no doubt be devastating for Clinton, as the two women have for years been joined at the hip. Abedin has at times been like Clinton’s shadow, has been called her “body woman,” and has even been rumored to be Clinton’s lesbian lover. So Abedin likely knows where, as is said, the bodies are buried. \\nOf particular note, the new e-mails allegedly contain information revealing that Hillary, Bill Clinton, Weiner, and numerous congressmen took trips to convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s private island, where he is said to pimp out underage minors of both sexes to prominent people. The trips were taken aboard Epstein’s Boeing 747, dubbed the “Lolita Express”; the pedophile’s island, in the US Virgin Islands, has been called “ Sex Slave Island .” \\nThese revelations would also explain why Clinton used powerful software called BleachBit to scrub damning information from her private server. According to BleachBit’s website, its program gives criminals and others the ability to “shred files to hide their contents and prevent data recovery.” \\nYet it can’t scrub bumbling perverts from your personal life, and Weiner’s laptop also contains incriminating e-mails revealing the mishandling of classified information by Abedin and Clinton, say the sources. Both women “sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts,” and this information could have been “accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers ... of unknown individuals,” writes True Pundit . \\nConsequently, according to True Pundit , FBI sources say the new Clinton investigation has been broadened and now includes matters such as how: • Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner’s email • Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails. • Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records • Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents • [a] private consultant managed Weiner’s site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domain’s listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts. \\nIf the new allegations in the True Pundit story are all accurate, they just add more intrigue to a presidential campaign that is truly unprecedented, with a torrent of WikiLeaks and Project Veritas revelations and now Clinton’s Weiner woes. From vote fraud to inciting violence to child sex abuse to pay-for-play to perjury, it’s becoming clear to many that the Democratic Party — and the Clintons in particular — are essentially a criminal syndicate. As former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said in a Sunday interview, “The Clintons, that’s a crime family, basically. It’s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.... God forbid we put someone like that [Clinton] in the White House.” And now we know better why, as I wrote Sunday, this “appears standard FBI sentiment. I personally know of an ex-agent — someone with knowledge of Clinton ‘crime family’ dealings — who I’m told is having trouble sleeping at night due to the prospect of a Clinton presidency.” \\nAll these revelations raise important questions: How could Hillary Clinton and her cohorts have bumbled so badly that they appear a cross between Inspector Clouseau and Boss Tweed ? \\nAnd if Clinton is so careless with her own personal survival, how can she be trusted with national survival? \\nPart of the explanation is general incompetence, yet there’s another factor: Both Clintons have engaged in continual criminality over the decades — and have been allowed to skate at every turn. This lack of accountability has led to complacency and ever-increasing brazenness, just as with a child never punished for wrongdoing. \\nSo, finally, perhaps, Clinton corruption has reached critical mass. And with Donald Trump ahead 10 points (according to one respected poll) among the 88 percent of voters who have definitely made up their minds, maybe, come late Tuesday evening, some tossing and turning FBI agents will finally be able to enjoy a good night’s rest. \\n'],\n",
       " ['Veteran’s Memorial Desecrated By Protesters, Can You Help Us Find Them? | Conservative Daily Post',\n",
       "  '\\nPosted by Matthew Bernstein | Nov 9, 2016 | American Strength People Thought It Would Be A Good Idea To Deface A Memorial Dedicated To Military Veterans \\nDespite all the talk of the election that has been discussed there is another significant event and pseudo-holiday coming up in two days. That would be Veteran’s Day. It’s a holiday that, as stated, is designed to make sure that we can remember our veterans from all military encounters. \\nIt’s something that should be taken very seriously, considering the fact that these veterans gave the ultimate price to make sure that YOU have the freedoms that you do now. And some people in the United States do, considering that there is memorials set up to honor these veterans. \\nExcept not everyone thinks that these memorials should be taken seriously. In fact, there are some people out there that don’t respect the memorials and everything that they stand for. They think it’s a good idea to DISRESPECT the memorials that are out there. \\nThe most recent example comes from someone who is against the Dakota Access Pipeline. They were so against it that they thought the best course of action would be to vandalize a memorial that was set specifically for World War II veterans in Washington. That came from the National Park Service on Tuesday. People Thought It Would Be A Good Idea To Vandalize A World War II Memorial \\nA spokesman by the name of Mike Litterst said that someone spray-painted the North Dakota section of the memorial. A photo that was provided by the park service showed the phrase “#NoDAPL” was written in paint. Yes they thought the best way to protest this would be to vandalize a memorial designed to honor military service members. \\nThat is honestly the most disgusting thing that could have EVER happened. There shouldn’t EVER be a reason that someone should vandalize a MILITARY memorial just to get their point across. These people put their lives ON THE LINE to make sure that you have the right to protest like you are doing! \\nThe person that vandalized this memorial was protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe has been fighting along with other tribes and environmental groups in an effort to stop the completion of the nearly $4 billion pipeline. They claimed that it was going to threaten the water supply for millions of people. \\nThe supporters of the pipeline have said that it is a safer way to move oil rather than trucks and trains. Considering that oil is very flammable and accidents can happen, I would rather see something be moved safely. But no matter what side you are on, vandalizing a memorial designed for military veterans is something that SHOULDN’T happen! \\nAs of right now, the United States Park Police are investigating the vandalism. But there is good news about this whole thing. The vandal had used paint to make his mark. And a paint stripper has been used to remove much of the damage that had been done. \\nThe pipeline protests have been going on for a long time. But President Obama has said that the federal government was looking for ways to “reroute” parts of the pipeline. It sounds like another attempt to appease people on the president’s behalf. \\nBut the bottom line is that these people thought it was a good idea to make their message heard by spray painting a VETERANS MEMORIAL! That is the ultimate sign of disrespect! And it makes it worse when you factor in that Veteran’s Day is literally two days away. It’s like they don’t care about the fact that these veterans made the ultimate sacrifice so they could pull those actions. These Men Risk Their Lives So That Families Across The USA Can Enjoy Freedom \\nEvery American should honor the fact that these veterans have given everything that they possibly could to make sure that the freedoms of the United States stay that way. And every memorial that is destroyed and vandalized is just another reminder that not everyone believes that military veterans should be thanked. \\nThose people are some of the worst Americans on the planet. If you want to protest something, then fine, but there is NO EXCUSE for anyone to vandalize a memorial designed to honor those that served. And the simple fact that someone thought it was a good idea is sickening. \\nThere are several ways to make your point but this is among one of the absolute worst out there. And what is even worse is that there are people that are going to think that it was a good idea. \\nSadly this isn’t the first time that this has happened. There were people that thought it was a good idea to vandalize a September 11, 2001 memorial . And the worst part of that was they actually did it. In a college town in California people thought it was a good idea to destroy something that means a lot to some people here in the country. \\nThat wasn’t the only time that this has happened. Just a couple weeks ago there was another report that someone thought it would be a good idea to destroy a veterans memorial . Yes there are people here in the United States that want to make sure that military people don’t get the respect that they deserve. It’s like these people have just lost all respect for those that have given everything and more for the safety of the country. \\nShare this article to make sure that we can find the person, or people, that is responsible for destroying a monument that is dedicated to our military veterans. What makes it worse is that it is so close to Veteran’s Day. The pure timing of this entire action is something that should make every red-blooded patriot in the country angry. \\nWe need your help to make sure that the people that are responsible for this action are caught and brought to justice. This type of activity is simply unacceptable. But with your help we can find the protestors that are responsible and make sure they pay for their crimes. '],\n",

       "  '\\nSuperstation95.com \\nNow, we know it\\'s bad! The FBI Director\\'s announcement that the Bureau had found more emails pertinent to its Hillary Clinton private e-mail server investigation, and was re-opening that investigation, sent shockwaves across the political spectrum this afternoon. \\nThe fact that the FBI made such an announcement is extraordinary in itself. Generally, the Bureau does NOT publicly reveal that someone is under investigation, never mind someone who is so high-profile, like an active candidate for President! So the revelation that the Hillary investigation is now re-opened is an absolute stunner on many levels. Frankly, all experts agree that it must be something extraordinary they found; something likely criminal. \\nAdding to the drama was that the FBI Director did NOT coordinate the announcement with the White House or with the Department of Justice (DOJ) - which could be an effort by the Bureau to regain its lost reputation for Integrity. Keeping the White house and Justice Department out of the loop means they could not interfere prior to the announcement, and now that the announcement has been made publicly, neither the White House nor the DOJ can prevent the public from knowing something big is taking place. \"DEVASTATING REVELATIONS\" \\nAnd \"big\" might be an understatement. Late Friday night, the White House very quietly CANCELED all of Barack Obama\\'s scheduled campaign appearances on behalf of Hillary Clinton! The scheduled events, confirmed for months, were all quietly DELETED. See the Before and After images below: \\nWhatever information the FBI has found must be completely devastating for Clinton. So devastating, that President Obama can no longer even be seen as supporting her candidacy! \\nThis FBI announcement has \"criminality\" written all over it. \\nStay tuned. '],\n",

       "  '\\n“Hail Hitler” and “Heil Victory” – do they eerily sound the same? It’s because it is. Alt-Right groups are performing Nazi-like salutes for President-Elect Donald Trump. What is the Alt-Right? \\nThe Alt-Right consists of white supremacist groups most likely composed of college-educated white men upholding the superiority of their skin color and believing in every right-wing propaganda. \\nSuch groups have gone almost extinct under President Obama’s administration, reduced to a few sites and pages on social media. However, they surfaced with renewed vigor after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 elections. \\nTheir leader, Richard B. Spencer, emerged as something of a wannabe Adolf Hitler and is calling for his followers to take back the U.S. as theirs. \\nRead Also: Russia Bombs Syria After Putin Speaks With Trump \\nOn November 20, a crowd of people gathered in front of the Ronald Reagan pavilion in Washington to listen to Spencer’s speech. \\nAfter quoting the Nazi propaganda in German, Spencer called the assembled white people “children of the sun.” In his speech, he expressed the central idealism of the group – that white-skinned Americans were born to conquer, not follow. \\nThe speech concluded with shouts of “Heil the people! Heil victory!” The people had their arms stretched out in front of them, reported the New York Times . \\nThere was little doubt as to what Spencer meant when he reiterated the belief that white-skinned Americans should not live in the shadows anymore. That the time had come for their “awakening to their own identity.” \\nRead Also: US, Syria, Russia And Iran International Relations Improving After Donald Trump Win Donald Trump Cabinet \\nDuring his Presidential campaign, Trump’s demeanor and discourse were equated with the most notorious leader of all time, Hitler. However, after his victory, his cabinet choices are leaving little to the imagination. \\nTrump has picked Steve Bannon, founder of the Breitbart website, to be his strategist. Breitbart is widely known to to be a platform for alt-right news. \\nWhat’s more, Richard Spencer expressed that he is looking forward to Bannon shaking things up in the White House. \\nThe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum vehemently condemned the “hateful rhetoric” spreading throughout the nation. \\nRead Also: Mike Pence Upholding Torture For Interrogation Under Donald Trump Administration? \\n“The Holocaust did not begin with killing, it began with words,” said the museum in a statement, reported Business Insider . “The Museum calls on all American citizens, our religious and civic leaders, and the leadership of all branches of the government to confront racist thinking and divisive hate speech.” Nazi-Like Salute For Trump \\nThere are other instances of alt-right supporters celebrating Trump’s victory in a Nazi-esque fashion. \\nA restaurant called Little Italy in Washington D.C. recently issued an apology for mistakenly hosting a banquet for a group called National Policy Institute (NPI), reported CBS News . Apparently, the group had tweeted a photo of some of their members giving a Nazi-salute to Donald Trump . \\n“This expression of support of Hitler is extremely offensive to us, as our restaurant is home to Teammates and Guests of every race, religion and cultural background,” said the restaurant on its Facebook page . \\n“We want to sincerely apologize to the community of Friendship Heights for inadvertently hosting this meeting, which resulted in hateful sentiment,” it added.

       " ['Will the Polar Vortex Return This Winter? - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  'This post was originally published on this site By Jeremiah Johnson Ready Nutrition November 3, 2016 \\nReadyNutrition Guys and Gals, “Old Man Winter” is starting to rear his ugly head. Yeah, so what? So there is a difference this year on three fronts. The first has to do with the weather itself, and the second is the situation in the U.S. and the world. Throughout history winter has been (at times) so severe as to cause large numbers of deaths and great hardships. Throughout history warfare has been conducted during the winter months after the harvest has been taken in. Between you and I, the harvest is being taken in, and the whole world has been on the brink of war for quite some time. The third front: in the U.S., with the election. \\nWeather, War, and Domestic Issues Could be a Recipe for Disaster \\nLet’s address the weather portion first. Think Progress posted an article on the polar vortex shift that will affect our winter considerably. The polar vortex is usually “confined” to an area around the North Pole. It is a gigantic, constantly-moving system of air that is circulating and swirling. As the site mentioned, the last polar vortex shift affected more than 200 million people in 2014. I can attest to the fact that I was one of them: in January of 2014, it was -26 Fahrenheit outside of my cabin, and never rose above -10 Fahrenheit for almost the entire month. \\nFrom the perspective of a global war, the Ukrainian-Russian situation is intensifying with the Ukrainian Army moving troops and equipment into Eastern Ukraine for operations against the separatists. As we speak, a Russian fleet is sailing toward Syria. The fighting in Syria between Assad’s forces and the Russian army and the Islamic terrorists is burning fiercely. The U.S. and Russia are facing off toward a nuclear war. North Korea continues to test missiles and threatens an EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) and/or nuclear attack on the U.S. about once a week. \\nThat “third front” of the domestic situation in the U.S…. believe it or not, here is the highest potential for something bad to occur. Such is because Obama will think nothing of enacting Martial Law with either the advent of civil unrest and rioting, and/or a nuclear war. The volatility and unpredictability of the situation can be the undoing of the entire country. '],\n",

       "  'George Ciccariello-Maher | November 9, 2016 \\nThe final election results are not in, but one thing is crystal clear: Hillary Clinton is a failure. And so is the neoliberal establishment. \\nEven if she narrowly manages to defeat Donald Trump, she has still lost. Her failure is not individual, however, but a failure of Clintonism, the Democratic Party, and decades of failed economic policies. According to some exit polls, Clinton is losing half of union households and getting routed in a rust belt abandoned by Clintonism: in Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, a state that she took so much for granted that she didn’t make a single campaign stop there . \\nAll this against a racist misogynist with no ground game, hemorrhaging the support of his own party leadership, with far fewer resources and a thousand character flaws and weaknesses to be exploited. All polls show that even many Trump voters doubted his qualifications and character, but they voted for him anyway. \\nConfronted with this reality, Clintonite liberals have been willfully ignorant, managing to both write poor whites off as racist deplorables while simultaneously underestimating their potential to swing to the Right. Neglecting poor whites, Clintonism holds Black and Latino Americans hostage, offering no solution to police murder and promising more deportations to boot. \\nThe blame game is already in full swing: Democratic apparatchiks are already preparing to blame FBI director James Comey, third party candidates, and it wouldn’t be surprising to hear Vladimir Putin’s name come up—the Red Scare never gets old. But the ire of a wounded Clintonism will no doubt be directed above all at the Left. \\nBut the liberal establishment and its neoliberal economic policies have failed, and it’s time for liberals to own that. The pundits, the talking heads, the press, and the pollsters are admitting that they had no idea what they were talking about and flailing for explanations. Maybe if liberal and conservative elites alike don’t have answers, it’s time to build a fighting left that can offer real solutions. \\nThe left needs to directly confront the racism that Trump harnessed, but it also needs to better understand what caused the Trump phenomenon to begin with. For all of his flaws, Bernie Sanders did the second, and you don’t have to like Sanders to admit that there’s no way he would have fucked this up so bad. \\nBut Sanders’ failure to capture the Democratic Party was no accident. If Trump wins, the same Democratic Party has been calling him a fascist and would-be dictator will demand that we recognize his legitimacy. They will suddenly discover that, instead of fighting back, they can reach across the aisle and work with this eccentric leader. \\nBut the reality is this: if you really believe that Trump is a fascist, you’d better be prepared to do more than just vote. \\n\\nGeorge Ciccariello-Maher is an organizer, radical political theorist, and professor at Drexel University.

I’m really glad now because I instantly hit it off with the hand.” \\n“I’ve not connected with anything like that since the time I took acid while I was camping in the Lake District and met a goat named Boris in the forest,” continued Mr Webber. “Sometimes I feel like I’ve got more in common with things than people, it’s like I can’t have a good conversation with something unless they’re not able to answer me back.” \\n“Me and the hand talked about all kinds of stuff,” revealed a reminiscent Mr Webber. “Brexit, the U.S. elections, diseases that have been eradicated, the potential dangers of genetically modifying food, chemtrail and all sorts of other really interesting things. She’s a great listener, I didn’t get her number but I’m sure I’ll see her around. Hopefully we can hang out again, I don’t want to be getting ahead of myself but I think she could be the one.” \\nAccording to Stacey Poole, the owner of the hand, she had her Saturday night ruined by “some little creature” who was following her around the club all night. \\n“I was just trying to have a good night but that little cretin wouldn’t leave me alone,” complained Stacey. “He tried to talk to me but he was off his nut so I gave him the old ‘talk to the hand’ line and put my hand in his face. The daft twat took it literally and started talking to my hand, at first it was kind of funny but I couldn’t get rid of him, he was following me everywhere, eventually I just had to leave.

       "  'Tweet \\nWhy hello boys and girls! Today’s topic, we try to tell the difference between another two often-confused terms: charting and sharting. Let’s go! \\nCharting refers to the process by which health care providers replace face-to-face time with face-to-chart time. If you did something, it needs to be charted . If you saw a patient, write a progress note . If you gave a patient a sandwich , write a sandwich note . \\nOn the other hand, sharting refers to the process by which health care providers replace their underwear and pants because they shat themselves when they thought they were just farting . Or charting for that matter. \\nCharting , though painful because it consumes over 99% of the entire workday, is never embarrassing, so in that respect it’s a good thing. This is different from sharting , which is never painful but always embarrassing. Especially if wearing white pants. \\nFirst priority when sharting is to survey the surroundings: is anyone around? If the coast is clear, the second priority is to assess the damage: tire tracks or swamp? In this respect, charting is not as stressful as sharting . \\nWhen you’re charting , all you can think about until you finish writing notes is, “Wow, this really sucks.” When you’re sharting , all you can think about until you change clothes is, “Wow, this really smells” and “Darn it, it’s going down my leg!” Whereas charting makes one pooped, sharting is pooping. \\nWhen someone sees you charting , they sympathize , maybe even empathize : “Gee, I hope that she finishes charting soon.” When someone sees you sharting , they laugh and point and tell others: “HAHAHAHAHA!! WHAT A LOSER!! ONLY LOSERS SHART!” It’s true: only losers shart. \\nSometimes when you’re charting you make a mistake, but it’s easy to addend or even mark in error and start a new note. Not with sharting . Sharting in and of itself is a mistake, a huge mistake, and way harder to erase the evidence of it. In fact, you need to discard your clothes immediately. But can you get to new clothing before someone spots you? For that reason, sharting is always worse than charting . \\nNow, do you know the difference between… '],\n",

       "  'Email Print Pre-election “results” conditioning public to accept rigged Hillary “victory” A NBC station was caught posting election results showing a Hillary Clinton victory days before the election, fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring Hillary. Political activists discovered a hidden web site for WRCB out of Chattanooga, Tenn. showing election results with Hillary Clinton securing 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote. The web site originated from the FTP server of WorldNow, a media software company that provides real-time data – such as election results – and other media assets to local news stations. The activist who found the page pointed out that the results align well with the “fractional vote” method used by voting machines to rig elections to a predetermined outcome. “On election day, you will see the same percentages overall, with only the numbers that claim to equal them different,” the activist reported. “The difference in total votes shown on the station pages, with the same overall final percentages proves the election theft is automated to hit desired percentages, no one has to lift a finger during the election itself to accomplish the steal.” Election fraud expert Bev Harris was the first to uncover this method, which is also known as “vote shaving.” “You need to have votes counted as fractions,” Harris said on The Alex Jones Show Monday. “You need the votes to be counted with decimal places, like you count money.” “If a vote is a dollar, you also need to have cents with it. That will not show. It’s hidden.” Vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers, which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes. “There’s this one central computer, which at the end of the day, all the votes come to it,” Harris pointed out. “That’s where you take it. You don’t run around to 5,000 different precincts. You wait until the votes come to you, and then you have your way with them.” And, interestingly, it appears the majority of the local news stations get their election results from the same software company. Skeptics suggested the WorldNow page was part of a code test to ensure the software would post the actual results, but surprisingly, the data on the page was typed in – with no apparent code tabulating anything. And it’s revealing that, more often than not, when the mainstream media “tests” election result software, it shows the establishment candidate winning the election. At the very least, the results page shows obvious media bias towards Hillary, and it follows a pattern by the mainstream media to claim Hillary has already won the election weeks before Nov. 8 in an attempt to suppress voter enthusiasm for Trump, which is one of his major advantages. This discovery comes amid Project Veritas’ damning videos exposing Democrat operatives discussing how they’ve been rigging elections for the last 50 years, as well as Wikileaks’ relentless data dumping of John Podesta’s emails revealing more collusion and corruption between the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media.

As cold weather begins to set in for the indigenous tribes facing off with oil companies in North Dakota, the solar panels will help generate electricity to provide the camp with life-sustaining heat and medical treatment. \\nEcoWatch reported that Ruffalo and Johns touted the necessity of switching to renewable energy in the wake of drastic climate change. Ruffalo also emphasized the right of Native Americans to protect their land from predatory fossil fuel companies. \\n“Around the world, more than 80 percent of the forests and lands with protected waterways and rich biodiversity are held by indigenous tribes. This is no coincidence,” Ruffalo said. “As so many of us suffer from polluted water, air and land in our rural and urban communities, the water defenders at Standing Rock are showing us another way.” \\nHowever, Ruffalo was quick to note that he was merely “trying to be of service” in using his platform to bring awareness to the Dakota Access Pipeline protest. \\n“It was really Wahleah Johns responsible for the delivery. I was there to draw the spotlight,” Ruffalo told US Uncut in an email. \\nJohns, whose company’s goal is to provide low-cost, renewable energy sources and green energy jobs for indigenous communities, praised the Standing Rock Sioux’s fight against Energy Transfer Partners’ pipeline, calling it necessary for the sake of the planet’s survival. \\n“Water is life,” said Johns , who is a leader in the Navajo nation. “By leading a transition to energy that is powered by the sun, the wind, and water, we ensure a better future for all of our people and for future generations.” \\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline, if constructed, would carry highly toxic tar sands oil through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois , where it would then be transported by train to ports on the Gulf of Mexico. Sacred land belonging to indigenous communities in North Dakota was destroyed for the pipeline route, with Native American leaders saying they were never consulted about the pipeline before construction began. The Standing Rock Sioux, who call themselves “water protectors,” say the pipeline would endanger drinking water for millions of people along the pipeline route. \\n\\nTom Cahill is a writer for US Uncut based in the Pacific Northwest.

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nOriginally posted at TomDispatch . \\nRecently, I was asked a question about Kill Anything That Moves , my history of civilian suffering during the Vietnam War. An interviewer wanted to know how I responded to veterans who took offense at the (supposed) implication that every American who served in Vietnam committed atrocities. \\nI think I softly snorted and slowly shook my head. \\nAlready two books behind me, Kill Anything That Moves might as well have been written by someone else in another lifetime. In some sense, it was. \\nIt takes effort for me to dredge up the faded memories of that work, a Kodachrome-hued swirl of hundreds of interviews on two continents over the course of a decade. But this particular question was easy enough to answer. Almost all the Americans I interviewed had seen combat, but most American veterans of the war hadn’t. Many had little or no real opportunity to commit war crimes. Case closed. \\nBut that question caused me to recall a host of related queries that churned around the book. Questions by skeptics, atrocity-deniers, fair-minded interviewers attempting to play devil’s advocate. A favorite was whether the book was “anti-veteran.” That, too, was a head-shaker for me. \\n“How could that be?” I would respond. After all, the book owed its genesis to veterans. Veterans were key sources for it. Veterans provided the evidence. Veterans provided the quotes. Veterans even supplied the title. The book was, to a great extent, the history of the war as described to me by veterans. The story I told was their story. How could that in any way be anti-veteran? \\nMany of the vets I spoke with viewed their truth-telling as a form of patriotism, of continuing service to country. Nate Terani’s inaugural TomDispatch essay follows in the same American tradition. His eyes were opened to the abuse of military power while living in Iran as a boy. Later he would join the U.S. Navy and wear the stars and stripes with particular pride. September 11th and all that came after – notably the demonization of his Muslim faith in his homeland – imbued him with a new mission, one he now views as no less sacred than his military service. \\nFrom Smedley Butler to Andrew Bacevich , Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning , Vietnam Veterans Against the War to Iraq Veterans Against the War , the U.S. armed forces have produced a steady stream of truth-tellers and whistleblowers, men and women willing to serve their country in profound ways during trying times. There’s no bronze star for activism, no Navy Cross for unpopular or contrarian opinions, no Purple Heart for the hard knocks involved in speaking out against war crimes or Islamophobia or laying bare information vital to the American public. Veterans who dare to do so have sometimes walked a cold, lonely road far from the warm glow enjoyed by summer soldiers and sunshine patriots. Those who do so exhibit a special form of courage that may even exceed the bravery of the battlefield, the courage to stand tall and make oneself a target, a courage deserving ( with a nod to Thomas Paine ) of the love and thanks of man and woman. ~ Nick Turse \\nTehran, USA Fighting Fundamentalism in America By Nate Terani \\nI’m not an immigrant, but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. \\nWhat I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, I’ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. \\nIn Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders – of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry – Islamophobia – threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I’ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. \\n“Death to America!” \\nAs a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of “Death to America!” That day would define the rest of my life. \\nIt was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting “Death to America!” I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. \\nIn a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school’s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us – if we ever wanted to see our families again – to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, “Death to America!” as they stomped on our sacred symbols. \\nI was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn’t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. \\nAcross the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate’s feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for – or against. \\n“Camel Jockey,” “Ayatollah,” and “Gandhi” \\nMy parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including “camel jockey,” “sand-nigger,” “raghead,” “ayatollah,” and ironically, “Gandhi” (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to “other-ize” me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. \\nYet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform – all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or that’s how I felt anyway as I wore my country’s uniform. \\nWhen I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. \\nBeing tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it weren’t for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. \\nThrough patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “otherness” of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. \\nIn 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve at the Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve. \\nIn the wake of 9/11, I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist “us vs. them” attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form, where they became something like an ideology and way of life. \\nBy the time I completed my military service in 2006, I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East, similarly disturbed, seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That, in turn, was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam – or rather of a portrait, painted by the powers-that-be, of Islam as a terror religion, as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert, waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel, through the patient approach of my childhood, the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. \\nFor the first time in my life, in a country gripped by fear, I believed I was witnessing a shift, en masse, toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason, not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran, I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now, it seemed to me, in America’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East, and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding, we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. \\nThe Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up \\nOn February 10, 2015, three young American students, Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Shaddy Barakat, were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as “a monster.” Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. \\nThe incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had, by then, thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this, using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism, pure and simple, inspired by hate-speakers here at home. \\nAt that moment, I reached out to fellow veterans who, I thought, might be willing to help – and it’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism, I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon – and I, of course, joined it. \\nFrom that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas, and that’s just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan, VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. We’ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities, sat with them through Ramadan, and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting , we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. \\nOur group was born of the belief that, as American military veterans, we had a responsibility to call out bigotry, hatred, and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies, and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and, for those of us who are Muslim, among them. \\nNationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life, and I, for my part, don’t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia, there no longer exists a “clash of civilizations.” Without Islamophobia, whatever the problems in the world may be, there is no longer an “us vs. them” and it’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. \\nAs of now, this remains the struggle of my life, for despite my intense love for America, some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the “other,” the enemy. \\nMy Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now, with her in mind and as a representative of VCI, when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare, as I did then. I give trust to gain trust, but always knowing that these days this isn’t just a matter of niceties. It’s a question of life or death. It’s part of a battle for the soul of our nation. \\nIn many ways, I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. It’s just that now I’m doing it in my own country. \\nNate Terani is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in military intelligence with the Defense Intelligence Agency.

       " ['Progress in Protecting Fetuses From Zika',\n",
       "  'For the past 18 months, pregnant women have lived in fear as Zika, a virus they had never heard of, spread throughout much of the world leaving behind thousands of babies born with underdeveloped brains and other birth defects. Medical researchers are aggressively trying to develop a vaccine or treatment that is effective in stopping the virus or protecting fetuses in wombs if their mother gets Zika. The good news announced this week is that scientists have had encouraging results.\\nClinical Trials of a Vaccine The first of five clinical trials in humans to test the safety and effectiveness of a Zika vaccine began, according to a National Institutes of Health (NIH) announcement Monday. Called the Zika Purified Inactivated Virus (ZPIV), the vaccine was developed using inactivated virus particles. The basic shell of the particles is intact to the particles evoke a response from the recipient’s immune system creating more antibodies. This technology and approach was successfully used in developing a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis.\\nThe NIH trial involves 75 people between the ages of 18 and 49 who have not had any sort of flavivirus. (Zika is a flavivirus. So are dengue, Japanese encephalitis and West Nile.) Participants will be randomly split into three groups. The first will receive two injections of either the test vaccine or a placebo 28 days apart. The other two groups will get the Japanese encephalitis vaccine or a yellow fever vaccine prior to receiving the two-dose ZPIV vaccine. A subgroup of 30 participants will receive the two-dose a third dose of the vaccine being tested a year later.\\nThe NIH announced that four other trials involving the ZPIV investigational vaccine within months. These vaccine studies are being fast-tracked, but it will take a few years to know the results.\\nAntibody Tests While the NIH research deals with a vaccine against the virus, other research has been under way to protect fetuses from the virus. An antibody that prevents a fetus from becoming infected with the virus has been identified and tested in mice. It also prevents damage to the placenta. Lastly, the antibody appears to provide protection against the virus for adult mice. The research conducted by teams from the medical schools at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., and Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., was published Monday in “Nature.”\\nThe research study in mice may not translate directly to humans. However, it suggests that scientists are on the right track studying antibodies from former Zika patients as a solution. The researchers actually screened 29 anti-Zika antibodies they gathered from people who recovered from the disease. One of them efficiently counteracted the five strains of the virus circulating worldwide in the lab tests. The antibodies identified “represent the first medical intervention that prevents Zika infection and damage to fetuses,” according to co-author James Crowe Jr., MD, of Vanderbilt.\\nTo test the antibody in live animals, the scientists gave it to pregnant mice either the day before or after being infected with Zika. In both instances, the antibodies successfully reduced the virus levels in the pregnant mice and their fetuses. They compared the results with those of pregnant mice infected with the disease but not given the antibody.\\nThe placentas seemed normal in the mice treated with the antibody, showing they were protected from the disease. In the untreated virus-infected mice, however, there was noticeable placental damage. “The anti-Zika antibodies are able to keep the fetus safe from harm by blocking the virus from crossing the placenta,” noted co-author Indira Mysorekar, PhD, a Washington University associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology.\\nWritten and Edited by Dyanne Weiss\\nSources:\\nNature: Neutralizing human antibodies prevent Zika virus replication and fetal disease in mice\\nWashington University School of Medicine: Antibody protects developing fetus from Zika virus, mouse study shows\\nNational Institutes of Health: Testing of Investigational inactivated Zika vaccine in humans begins\\nTIME: Zika Vaccines Are Growing More Promising\\nPhoto courtesy of NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases – Creative Commons license microcephaly , Vaccine , Zika'],\n",

       " ['Can The American People Defeat The Oligarchy That Rules Them?     : Information',\n",
       "  \" Can The American People Defeat The Oligarchy That Rules Them? By Paul Craig Roberts\\n Aren\\x92t you surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes haven\\x92t blamed Putin for FBI director Comey\\x92s reopening of the Hillary email case? But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary.\\nAccording to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don\\x92t need to worry about Hillary\\x92s crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? The presstitutes\\x92 cry is that Comey\\x92s alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation.\\nIn July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary\\x92s violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls.\\nActually, Hillary\\x92s standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate\\x92s public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election.\\nHillary\\x92s problem has the ruling American Oligarcy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn?\\nAll of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the Presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington had succeeded in putting its French vassal, Sarkozy, in the presidency of France.\\nThis is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans\\x92 minds.\\nThe Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let\\x92s see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people.\\nWhile we wait, let\\x92s concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media.\\nBut really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percent\\x92s power makes them immune to law. Hillary\\x92s crimes might cost her the election, but she won\\x92t go to jail.\\nNot content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests.\\nBecause of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have \\x93banks too big to fail,\\x94 unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media.\\nNot so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists.\\nIn the article below, Rahul Manchanda, explains that \\x93yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate, to create another gargantuan media outlet, in another consolidation of the enormous power, money, wealth, intimidation, conspiracy and control\\x94 that eviscerates the US Constitution and the First Amendment.\\nDr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following.

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nDOHA (Qatar), November 16. /TASS/. Real steps should be taken to restore Russia’s anti-doping system, President of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) Alexander Zhukov said at a session of the General Assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) on Wednesday. \\n“Our NOC shares the concern over the situation in the anti-doping system,” Zhukov said. “Let us take practical measures to change the situation for the better and restore the atmosphere of trust and openness.” \\nRussia’s Investigative Committee has questioned over 50 persons in the anti-doping probe, Zhukov said. \\n“Speaking about measures taken in Russia to fight doping, I would like to stress that our steps for restoring the anti-doping system in Russia are consistent and being implemented at all the levels with the full support of the Russian government,” Zhukov told the ANOC General Assembly. \\n“Recently, a federal law was adopted to stipulate punishment for encouraging doping. All the people who were involved in doping scandals were disqualified and dismissed. During the investigation of criminal cases related to the breach of anti-doping rules, prosecutors questioned over 50 athletes, representatives of federations and employees of the Sports Ministry,” he said. \\n“Already now, a whole number of employees have been dismissed from the Sports Ministry and those organizations that are controlled by it,” Zhukov said. \\nRussia’s Olympic chief thanked the international sports community for the decision to admit the Russian national team to the 2016 Rio Olympics. \\n“The Olympiad in Rio was a great success and we overcame all the obstacles and traversed a difficult road,” Zhukov said. \\n“It was not easy for us, especially considering the situation with the possible ban on Russians.

       " ['2 Police Officers Turn In Badges In Support Of Standing Rock Water Protectors – The Mind Unleashed',\n",
       "  '2 Police Officers Turn In Badges In Support Of Standing Rock Water Protectors Nov 3, 2016 162 0 \\nEarlier today it was reported by Redhawk at Standing Rock in North Dakota that two police officers have turned in their badges in support of the water protectors. \\n“There have been at least 2 reports of police officers turning in their badges acknowledging that this battle is not what they signed up for. You can see it in some of them, that they do not support the police actions. We must keep reminding them they are welcome to put down their weapons and badge and take a stand against this pipeline as well. Some are waking up.” -Redhawk Hearts are opening. \\nWith actions from militarized police continuing to be seen as extremely violent and dangerous, this news is a big win for the water protectors and for humanity as a whole. While the actions of some police officers are not appropriate, we all must continue to visualize and intend/pray that the hearts of all involved in this situation continue to open. Police must be held accountable for their actions, though we must continue to welcome them over to the side of the water protectors. \\nHaving the police lay down their weapons and join the people is the goal. It is also a win-win solution, which is the best case scenario. So what is it that opened the hearts of these two officers? \\nAt the time of this writing, the answer is not known but we can speculate on a few different items. Word is spreading quickly that there are 17 multi-national banks funding this pipeline and that the propaganda being spread about this deal “creating American jobs” or “helping America’s economy” is being seen as just that, propaganda. The American people, as well as people of the world, know that the big banks and U.S. Government does not care for the people, but only themselves. These banks and the government showed their hand in 2008 when they were bailed out after the stock market crash, leaving the public to bear the economic and social burdens. Even the police are becoming aware of this fact that the government and banks do not care for them and see the police only as pawns in a bigger game the government wishes to control. Water is life is not just a meaningless slogan in many people’s minds. It is becoming understood by more and more that water IS indeed life. If water becomes toxic, all life that depends on that water becomes toxic…including the families of these same police officers who are currently protecting the construction sites. They too would be affected by toxic water. It is innately traumatizing for humans to hurt other humans. While we have been seeing this for some time now with this situation, police officers are realizing the harm they do when they assault an unarmed, peaceful water protector. In essence, peace is wanting and needing to be established. \\nTake a look at what happened in Frankfurt, Germany in May of 2012. The police removed their helmets and began marching with the people who were protesting the big banks, while also safely escorting them down the streets. The world continues to awaken. \\nLet us all use this latest news as a big step forward towards peace and resolution of this pipeline issue. The pipeline construction needs to and must stop. With the announcement from Barack Obama yesterday that the White House is considering “re-routing” the pipeline, we must continue to demand that it’s construction cease entirely. We can also view that statement as a buckling of the Establishment. Continue on, water protectors.

       " ['Hillary Wins Popular Vote; Trump Will Be the Next President',\n",
       "  'Email \\nFollowing one of the most contentious presidential elections in recent memory, Hillary Clinton won more popular votes than Donald Trump in the nationwide election — while losing to Trump in the Electoral College vote. As of Wednesday morning (when this is being written), incomplete returns showed Clinton leading Trump by 165,292 popular votes — 59,344,158 to 59,178,867. But since the Constitution still reigns, members of the Electoral College are expected to meet next month and elect Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. \\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution states: Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress…. \\nThat means that 100 electors (representing two senators from each of the 50 states) plus 435 electors (representing the 435 members of the House of Representatives) plus three electors granted to the District of Columbia (a total of 538 electors) will actually elect the next president of the United States, not the voters themselves. Those electors are going to give Trump at least 289 votes, more than the 270 needed to elect him as president. \\nIf Hillary had her way she would be president instead. As far back as the year 2000, in her first public appearance as New York’s junior senator-elect, she said: “I believe strongly that in a democracy [sic], we should respect the will of the people, and to me that means it’s time to do away with the Electoral College and move to the popular election of our president.” \\nWhich is precisely why the Founders of the Republic did everything they could think of to keep the newborn republic from being transformed by power seekers such as Clinton into a democracy by putting in place such apparent anomalies as the Electoral College. \\nWriting in The New American , constitutional lawyer Joe Wolverton explained one of the reasons why. In an article just before the national elections in 2012, he noted: As the situation stands today, a successful candidate is required to build a coalition of electoral support from across the country. The frequent trips to Iowa, New Hampshire, and other less populous states witness this campaign reality. To be elected, a candidate cannot simply woo voters in urban areas while ignoring those citizens living between the two coastal megalopolises. Should [a] National Popular Vote measure become the de facto law of the land, a candidate could simply spend time, money, and attention on the large cities in order to ensure garnering a plurality of votes on Election Day. \\nJohn Ryder, then a member of the Republican National Committee, expanded: “Under such an arrangement, presidential candidates would have no incentive to campaign anywhere except the major media markets in a few states. The country would, in essence, cede our presidential elections to the largest metropolitan areas, whose concerns are different from those of other areas of the country.” \\nThe Founders knew from history the dangers of letting a majority override the interests and rights of a minority — that that majority would eventually become tyrannical, inimical to the minority’s rights. Constitutional scholar Dan Smoot explained: From their vast knowledge of history, the American Founding Fathers knew that unlimited political power cannot safely be trusted to anyone — not to appointed officials of government, not to elected representatives of the people, not to the people themselves. Hence, they devised a system to control political power by dispersing it and balancing it so that too much power could not be concentrated in any one place. \\nBy requiring the states to nominate its own electors, those smaller states would have a larger voice in the national election, as James Madison noted in The Federalist Papers : “It may well be that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people , will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves.” (Emphasis added.) \\nMadison continued: The immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president] and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choices. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to so complicated an investigation. \\nPulitzer-Prize winner and conservative commentator George Will saw clearly what the Founders were trying to accomplish through the Electoral College’s interposition between the people and those running for the presidency, noting: The core principle of our republicanism is representation: The people do not decide things[;] they decide who will decide. Representatives are supposed to deliberate about the national interest, not just broker demands registered from various factions. \\nThere were other reasons as well. Gouvenour Morris, a Founding Father who represented Pennsylvania during the Constitutional Convention in 1787, explained that there were fears of “intrigue” if the president were chosen by a small group of men who met clandestinely, as well as concerns over his independence from the Legislative branch if he was elected by the Congress. \\nFisher Ames, a member of the first three Congresses, was blunt: The Electoral College was designed to protect the citizenry against the dangers and ravages of a runaway democracy: “Popular reason does not always know how to act right, nor does it always act right when it knows.” He added that “every move … towards a more complete, unmixed democracy is an advance towards destruction; it is treading where the ground is treacherous and excavated for an explosion. Liberty has never yet lasted long in a democracy; nor has it ever ended in anything better than despotism.” \\nA scant 165,292 votes cast on Tuesday, without the Electoral College in place, would have elected one skilled in the ways of treachery, despotism, and destruction. \\n\\nAn Ivy League graduate and former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.

       "  'The Rothschild Family has corrupted global banks, news media, oil and government share in: Central banks , Currency & debt , Deception , Energy , Freedom \\nThe New World Order might seem a bit far-fetched for many. A handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age. The thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists. There is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist. That belief has been re-iterated many times, mostly from the mainstream media. There are people who see the world for what they are told it is, others see what’s really going on behind the curtain. The stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful. They either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives. \\nGlobal mega-corporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis. A select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money, while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat. If humans stay busy working 40 weekly hours for very little income, they won’t have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand. The top 1 percent doesn’t want Americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business’. \\nThe global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire. All of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system. Money is necessary for our survival in the real world today. Most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system. If money is the god of our time, that makes Rothschild his prophet. Public School programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds. They continue the shaping through the media. We are taught what they want us to know and nothing more. \\nThe rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses. When the top 1 percent owns the majority of banks, resources and even our governments, it means big problems for the people. The Rothschilds’ are worth over $500 trillion and they are just 1 of 13 families that pretty much collectively own the world. The Rothschilds’ alone could pay off the US national debt 26 times over. Unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the world’s central banks. The New World Order’s agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources. \\nSources: '],\n",

       " ['SYRIA UPDATE: Russia negotiating with Turkey to withdraw Jihadis from Aleppo',\n",
       "  'November 2, 2016 555 Russian and Turkish military chiefs meet in Moscow today as Russia publicly demands withdrawal of all Jihadis from Aleppo. Share on Facebook Following the failure of the Al-Qaeda attempt to break the siege of the Jihadi held district of Aleppo, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is giving the Jihadis in eastern Aleppo what is effectively an ultimatum. The terms of this ultimatum have been set out by General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the Russian military’s General Staff: “Taking into account that our American colleagues are incapable of separating the opposition from terrorists, we appeal to all the leaders of armed groups directly to stop combat actions and leave Aleppo with their arms.” (bold italics added) To this end two corridors have been opened to enable the Jihadis to retreat, one heading towards the Turkish border, and the other heading to the Al-Qaeda controlled western Syrian city of Idlib. In addition there are a further six humanitarian corridors for civilians to use if they want to leave. Gerasimov is currently engaged in meetings in Moscow with General Hulusi Akar , the Chief of the Turkish military’s General Staff, who is currently visiting him in Moscow. Having despaired of getting the US to separate Al-Qaeda/Jabhat Al-Nusra from the other Jihadis in Aleppo, and getting them to withdraw, it is likely the Russians are trying to agree the same thing with the Turks. Indeed Gerasimov’s comments today essentially say as much. Given that the Jihadis fighting in Syria totally depend on Turkey for their supplies, if the Turkish leadership tells them to quit eastern Aleppo there is a possibility that they may finally accept that the game is up and heed the call. The same thing has after all recently happened in other Syrian towns and cities, including in the formerly Jihadi controlled suburbs of Damascus. Note that Putin’s ultimatum is phrased differently from the way it was before. The Kerry-Lavrov agreement of 9th September 2016 offered the non Al-Qaeda Jihadis the option of staying in eastern Aleppo after they had separated themselves from Al-Qaeda/Jabhat Al-Nusra, who the agreement implicitly required to leave. In the subsequent discussions in the UN Security Council that took place around the proposed French Resolution, the Russians made it clear that the Al-Qaeda/Jabhat Al-Nusra was required to leave, and this was the demand the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura supposedly supported, though as I have discussed previously the terms under which he did it actually nullified it. Now Putin through Gerasimov is demanding that all Jihadi fighters in eastern Aleppo leave, irrespective of whether they belong to Al-Qaeda/Jabhat Al-Nusra or not. In other words over the course of the autumn, as the US has hesitated and reneged on its promises, the Russians have quietly raised their demands. They now want Aleppo totally rid of Jihadi fighters and handed over entirely to the Syrian government. This was surely the Russian objective all along, but it has now been made clear. As to what happens if the Jihadi fighters in eastern Aleppo reject this demand, Gerasimov pointed it out to them : “The militants’ efforts to break loose from the city have failed. The terrorists have suffered huge losses in manpower, weapons and equipment. They are unable to pull out of the city.” In other words the Jihadis in eastern Aleppo are trapped with no way out and no-one is coming to their rescue. According to RT’s Arabic service (as reported by the Iranian news agency Fars) the Jihadis have themselves admitted that they suffered casualties (dead and wounded) numbering between 2,200 and 2,500 men in their failed attempt to break the siege of eastern Aleppo over the last few days. Meanwhile the Syrian aligned Al-Masdar news agency is reporting that it has been told by a Syrian army source that following the deployment of elite and Special Forces troops to Aleppo, if the Syrian army returns to the offensive “unlike the previous offensives in Aleppo City, this assault will not be halted for any reason.” Gerasimov is reported to have said that the ceasefire to enable the Jihadis to retreat from Aleppo will take effect at 9:00 am local time on Friday 4th November 2016, and will expires at 7 pm on the same day. However if the Jihadis agree to leave Aleppo and take actual steps to do so, that period will presumably be extended. Much will probably depend on the outcome of the talks General Gerasimov is having with General Hulusi Akar today. '],\n",

Some nights I would take my makeup off before the gym and look in the mirror and just bawl my eyes out, and I wouldn't even end up working out because I was so worried about how I looked.” \\nLomas goes on to explain that while she lacks confidence in her skin, she doesn't lack confidence in herself. Learning the difference, she says, was the key to feeling better about her flaws: \\n“I've come a long way from the girl who used to cry every single night about the way her skin looked. These days my skin is just a minor downer for me sometimes. This post is just to show you all that you should be confident despite your little flaws.” \\nBy sharing her flaws with her fans, Lomas hopes that she can inspire them to be more forgiving of themselves. A photo posted by BECK LOMAS (@becklomas) on Sep 14, 2016 at 4:23pm PDT \\nShe also wants to make a point about beauty. Beauty, she says, isn't bound up in your skin or your physical flaws, but in your outlook: \\n“Happy people are the most beautiful people, and I know it's hard to feel happy when you're focusing on your imperfections— but I just want to let you all know that you are beautiful EVEN if you have acne, or bacne, or cellulite, or your thighs touch or you've got stretch marks. You are beautiful and unique and amazing as you are, and being confident and happy and that will shine through and make you even more beautiful!” \\nLomas concludes the post by urging her followers not to let their imperfections destroy their confidence in who they are. A photo posted by BECK LOMAS (@becklomas) on Aug 18, 2016 at 7:42pm PDT \\nHer honesty was appreciated by those who saw the photo, many of whom thanked her or spoke about how much they could relate to Lomas' struggle with her flaws. One commenter writes: \\n“You're a beautiful girl inside and out. I'm sure you know this but I just wanted to tell you to be certain. Thanks for your authenticity. In a world full of fake, it's very refreshing.” \\nBeck Lomas wants to remind her fans of an important lesson: \\n“To anyone else who is struggling with skin issues— you aren't alone and things will get better, so just hang in there!” \"],\n",

       "  'Share on Twitter \\nA new study shows that after the Obama administration\\'s Department of Justice (DOJ) collected billions in settlement money from U.S. banks after the mortgage collapse of 2008, it directed millions upon millions of dollars to several non-government organizations. \\nPeter Schweitzer, author of the book “Clinton Cash” and founder of the Government Accountability Institute , told Fox News\\'s Megyn Kelly that tens of millions of dollars from the record-breaking settlements in the bank deals were sent to these \\' charitable\\' groups , some of whose jobs would be to get out the vote for... Democrats: \\n“The banks are obviously eager to settle [and not go to trial]. [P]art of that settlement... will go to the victims of the crime you committed, but some of the money will go to pay restitution in the form of giving that money to non-profit organizations. These are non-profit organizations that are overwhelmingly progressive and serve as an adjunct to the Democratic party.” \\nOne group he mentioned on “ The Kelly File ” was fairly benign-sounding: \\n“One organization that has received millions of dollars is in New York called the Asian Americans for Equality. Sounds like a great idea, right? The problem is, when you look into this organization which got money from banks via the Department of Justice, this is an organization affiliated with the Communist Workers Party. I didn\\'t even know the Communist Workers Party was around anymore and, in fact, the organization that received this money is sympathetic to the North Korean regime.” \\nIndeed, the New York Times reports that many of the founders of Asian Americans for Equality (AAE) were active members of the Communist Workers Party, though AAE has since distanced itself from any modern-day ties. \\nIn August, Andy Koenig of the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce wrote in The Wall Street Journal about the giveaways by the DOJ to friendly groups, or as he put it, “a handout to the administration\\'s allies” [emphasis added]: \\n\"Some groups on the list—Catholic Charities, for instance—are relatively nonpolitical. Others—La Raza, the National Urban League, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition and more—are anything but. \\nMany of these groups engage in voter registration , community organizing and lobbying on liberal policy priorities at every level of government. They also provide grants to other liberal groups not eligible for payouts under the settlements. Thanks to the Obama administration, and the fungibility of money, the settlements’ beneficiaries can now devote hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to these activities.\" \\nJudicial Watch began an investigation in 2012, and here\\'s what it said about how the Obama administration ladled out the vast amounts of money: \\n“The Department of Justice (DOJ) will determine which \\'qualified organizations\\' get leftover settlement cash and Democrat-tied groups like the scandal-plagued Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) and the open-borders National Council of La Raza (NCLR) stand to get large sums based on the hastily arranged deal which got court approval in just a few days.” \\nThe disgraced ACORN , the group that used protests to pressure banks into giving mortgages to people who couldn\\'t qualify , was among those receiving Obama justice department funds. The group is now known under its new name, Mutual Housing Association of New York. \\nThe DOJ also gave funds to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which carries the very name of the legislation signed into law by Bill Clinton — The Community Reinvestment Act — believed by many to be responsible for the implosion of the mortgage-lending industry. \\nSome additional groups receiving the bank settlement money included: \\nMinneapolis High Rise Representative Council [ACORN affiliate] \\nLa Raza '],\n",

       " ['What Are the Ukronazis Up to in Crimea? - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nFirst, it appeared to be a fluke: this summer the Ukronazi regime sent a small terrorist unit into Crimea tasked with blowing up several targets in the Crimea (see here for details). They were arrested by the Russian security services. In November, another two saboteurs were caught by the FSB (see here ). And now something really remarkable happened. The Ukronazi security service kidnapped two Russian citizens in broad daylight and accused them of being “deserters”. Turns out that the two kidnapped men are Maksim Odintsov and Alexander Baranov and that both of them are junior servicemen in the Russian military (ensign and junior sergeant). Apparently, what happened is this: Odintsov and Baranov used to serve in the Ukrainian military (at least that is what the SBU claims), but when Crimea, where Odintsov and Baranov live, returned to Russia they did what tens of thousands of other Ukrainian servicemen did – they joined the Russian military. The two were lured to the neutral zone between Crimea and the Ukraine by men who promised them that they could give them diplomas proving that they had a higher education from Ukrainian institutions. You can watch this video to see what actually happened next (no translation needed): \\n[embedded content] \\nThe video also shows one of the two men, with a superb shiner on his face, admitting that he had served in the Ukrainian military and that he is guilty of treason. What is remarkable here is that the Ukronazis kidnapped these two men in broad daylight in an location which was clearly under video monitoring, and that they then showed one of the hostages with a clear sign of the beating he received. No matter how incompetent the SBU is, they are not so incompetent as to not realize the fantastically provocative nature of their actions. This was an absolutely deliberate provocation whose goal was to get some kind of Russian reaction, either in Crimea or somewhere else. \\nWhat were they really hoping for? \\nProbably for some kind of Russian reaction which would reach across the border: some kind of attack on the Ukrainian border post, or maybe an artillery strike. Maybe even an attempt to free the two men, or even a retaliatory counter-kidnapping. What they knew is that any Russian reaction across the border would have been met by a hysterical chorus of outrage from the western political leaders and their corporate media. \\nFor the time being, the (hideously slowly clumsy and poorly updated) website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had nothing to say. The (marginally better) website of the President of Russia offered this reaction : \\nQuestion : Mr President, I want to clarify the situation with the Russian military service personnel detained by the Ukrainians. What measures are you taking? \\nVladimir Putin : I cannot say anything about these measures yet and can say only what we know at present, which is that these military servicemen formerly served in the Ukrainian armed forces and, after Crimea’s reunification with Russia, decided to serve in the Russian armed forces. \\nIn this respect, let me say first of all that we have always had great respect for and trust in Ukrainian military service personnel, and therefore proposed that they continue their service in our ranks. \\nSecond, they wanted to obtain confirmation of education at one of Ukraine’s higher education establishments, and this was why they went to the border. They were lured a few metres further and detained. \\nI think this kind of treachery will ultimately turn against those who carry out such acts. This is the same kind of thing as switching off the power supply to Crimea in winter and just before New Year. If people in Ukraine think they can win Crimea residents’ sympathy this way, this amounts to an attack using inappropriate means, to use legal language. \\nIn other words: other than issuing a verbal condemnation, Russia will not react in any dramatic manner. This is, of course, the correct decision, especially now that Trump is hopefully going to replace the Neocons with some patriotically minded and mentally sane officials. But there is also an inherent risk in this Russian stance: it invites the Ukronazis to further escalate their provocations. \\nConsider this: while the junta in Kiev has been constantly shelling the Donbass, the Kremlin did nothing to stop it. When top Novorussian officials, such as Motorola, were murdered by somebody hired by the junta, the Russians again did nothing. Nor did the Moscow retaliate when the Ukronazis sent saboteurs into Crimea. What I fear is that next the Ukronazis will combine these two provocations into one and attack Crimea directly, either by lobbing a mortar shell directly across the border or even with an artillery attack upon a town in northern Crimea. \\nWhile from a military point of view a Russian response is a no-brainer, from the political point of view this might be much harder. Imagine this: \\nThe SBU hides one single artillery piece in a town just north of the Crimean-Ukrainian border and then begins to shell, at night, of course, Russian military positions or town, in northern Crimea. Several Russian soldiers or civilians are killed, more are wounded. The Russian counter-battery radars will immediately and easily detect the location from which these attacks came, but we all know since the MH-17 that Russian radar recordings are considered worthless by the western corporate media. And if the Russian counter-strike hits a town, this will be presented as yet another aggression against the “sovereign and free Ukraine”. The Russians all remember how on 08.08.08 it was Russia, not Georgia, which was declared the aggressor and how when months later the investigative committees of the EU declared that, well, no, it was actually the Georgians who attacked the Russian peacekeepers nobody in the West paid any attention to this. The reality is that the otherwise weak, militarily incompetent, Ukraine holds the “escalation dominance” over Russia, especially in Crimea. Yes, on every rung of the escalatory ladder Russia is vastly more capable and powerful than the Ukraine, but it is the Ukraine which can chose on which rung of the escalatory ladder it chooses to engage Russia. Sounds paradoxical? \\nORDER IT NOW \\nThat is because, as I have been repeating for years now, the purpose of the regime in Kiev is not to win an unwinnable conflict against Russia, but only to draw Russia into the Ukraine. Russia should have escalation dominance over the Ukraine, but in reality it is Ukraine which will get to chose at which rung of the escalation ladder Russia will be forced to react. This is a typical case where “ the action is in the reaction ”. \\nAnd let’s be honest, with the US Neocons out of power very soon, at least temporarily, the junta in Kiev has absolutely nothing to lose from a direct, blatant, attack on Russia. Think of it: the EU and NATO leaders in Europe are absolutely horrified by the Trump victory and they are desperate for a crisis, any crisis, which would give them a meaning, a sense of purpose, a justification before the European public opinion. As for the Americans, Trump will only become President on January 20 th , that leaves them enough time to react to any crisis, even an artificial one, in such a manner as to preempt any attempts by the new administration to improve relations with Russia. \\nSure looks to me like the Neocons, the EU/NATO comprador elites and the Ukronazis in Kiev all have exactly the same interests: trigger a crisis before Trump is sworn in. \\nIn the meantime, the Minister of Culture of the Ukraine has declared that the people of the Donbass a “genetically unfit” to accept the Ukrainian culture (does anybody still wonder why I call this regime “Ukronazi” and not “Ukrainian”?) while the European Parliament has declared that the EU is in a state of “informational war” with Russia and that the EU needs to “respond” to the Russian attack. \\nAs for Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia are all preparing for an imminent Russian invasion. As for the Poles, they are busy exhuming the body of Lech Kaczynski in the hope to prove that Russian shot down his aircraft in 2010. \\nThe next couple of months will be very dangerous indeed.

Does that make me an Iranian stooge or an American patriot? Watch The Debate and make up your own mind. –Kevin Barrett \\nPress TV Debate , featuring Kevin Barrett , Veterans Today Editor \\nThe 13th day of the Iranian calendar month of Aban, which falls on November 3, is known as the Student Day in Iran, marking the National Day of Fight against Global Arrogance. On this day 37 years ago, a group of Iranian university students took over the US embassy in Tehran, which had turned into a center of espionage aimed at overthrowing the Islamic Republic following the country’s Islamic Revolution earlier in 1979. \\nPress TV has spoken to Kevin Barrett, an author and Middle East expert, as well as Maxine Dovere, a journalist and political commentator, to get their take on this issue. \\nBarrett believes the US embassy in Iran was a “CIA station” which was used to “run the country” before the revolution, adding that Iranian students had every right to take it over. \\nHe also said the United States was using its embassy to essentially “dominate” and “exploit” Iran through the puppet government of the Shah whose “torturers were trained by the CIA.” \\nThe analyst further stated the US is an “aggressive imperial power” which has been waging wars of “disguised aggression” throughout the world. \\nHe also opined that the United States is “today’s supreme war criminal” which has been using the word “preemptive war” to legitimize its “naked undisguised aggressions” after the “neoconservative-Zionist coup d’état of September 11, 2001.” \\n“The neoconservatives in particular after their coup d’état on September 11, 2001 made it clear that any country in the world that seeks parity with the United States must be destroyed preemptively and that is essentially the situation we have today as the US Empire is out there crushing the Middle East, destroying all of Israel’s enemies through balkanization, through Oded Yinon Plan to break up these countries into smaller units along ethnic and sectarian lines, getting ready for a war with China and provoking a war with Russia through aggressive actions in Ukraine and through the destruction of Syria and threats against Russia when Russia comes to the defense of Syria,” he said. \\nElsewhere in his remarks, Barrett noted that both US presidential candidates are “quite horrific” in their policies toward the Middle East – namely Iran. \\nHe also asserted that Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei is “absolutely right” in saying that he cannot trust the United States and that Tehran has to “rethink” the opening it has had towards Washington. \\nAyatollah Khamenei has warned that compromise with the United States will not resolve Iran’s problems as Washington has not set aside its hostilities towards the Iranian nation. \\nMeanwhile the other panelist on Press TV’s program, Maxine Dovere, mentioned that taking over an embassy is not “an acceptable diplomatic action” anywhere in the world. \\n“An embassy is sacred ground for any country in any other country. Having a diplomatic dispute is certainly one of the things that happens in political and diplomatic life but taking over an embassy and holding diplomats hostage is not within the realm of normal political behavior,” she said. \\nAccording to the commentator, the United States and Iran need to come to “a civil understanding” and “a trust,” adding that part of this process is eliminating the shaky foundations that have existed until 2016. \\nElsewhere in her remarks, she dismissed the US election campaign as a “negative personality cult” which has not concentrated on policy, economics, and foreign relations. \\nShe also said all the important issues that a president eventually has to deal with seem to have gotten lost in this election campaign.

       "  'Getty - Chip Somodevilla The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \\nIn case you missed the political advertisement for Obamacare, it was touted as the “Affordable Care Act.” \\nHere are Democrats hyping the program, which the Obamacare architect described as a pathway to single-payer : \\nNot too long ago, another fan of single-payer healthcare was Donald Trump. But don\\'t take our word for it, look no further than the unofficial Trump campaign arm Breitbart.com for evidence . As Trump said in September 2015: \\nScott Pelley: Universal health care. \\nDonald Trump: I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now. \\nIn 1999, Trump was perfectly clear , as reported by Newsmax: \\n“I said I’m conservative, generally speaking, I’m conservative, and even very conservative,” Trump told King in response to a question about a “patients\\' bill of rights,” reports BuzzFeed. \\n“But I’m quite liberal and getting much more liberal on healthcare and other things. I really say: What’s the purpose of a country if you’re not going to have defensive and healthcare?” he told King. \"If you can’t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it’s all over. I mean, it’s no good. \\n“So I’m very liberal when it comes to healthcare. I believe in universal healthcare. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.” \\nAfter Obamacare passed, Trump sat down for an interview on HLN. This is what he had to say, as noted by The Washington Examiner: \\n“Number one, as a human being, I like to see people — it\\'s inconceivable that, you know, people are sick, like you get sick, or I get sick, or the kids get sick, and you bring \\'em to a doctor, inconceivable that, you know, 31 or 33 million people can\\'t do that,” Trump told host Joy Behar. “So on one level, I think something had to be done.” \\nTrump continued, saying the law is “really going to cost a lot of money in terms of competitiveness with this country” and said it would cost a friend\\'s company “over $200 million a year.” \\nHere is what Trump recently tweeted: Obamacare is a disaster - as I\\'ve been saying from the beginning. Time to repeal & replace! #ObamacareFail pic.twitter.com/5CvoMbVceT — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 \\nDid Trump say it was a “disaster from the beginning,” or “on one level, I think something had to be done”? \\nPerhaps, we turn to another tweet he had, drawing on the popular hashtag #ObamaCareInThreeWords: REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 \\nIt turns out that Donald Trump is a fan of “repeal and replace,” but his political track record before he ran for president as a Republican shows that what he means by that is “single-payer”—the goal of the Obamacare architect all along. \\nWhen it comes to Trump\\'s solution for Obamacare—making it more competitive for insurance companies—this runs antithetical to the goal of single-payer, which is the government (i.e. taxpayers) paying for everyone. \\nOne can draw their own conclusions about what Trump actually means right now, because no one can be one hundred percent sure. Yet for a man who styled himself as an outsider and not at all like a “politician,” his statements on Obamacare show himself very much to be similar to one. '],\n",

       "  '\\nPosted by Elliot Bougis | Nov 16, 2016 | Breaking News Just when you thought it was safe to go back on the Internet… \\nI have been reporting for weeks now about the D.C.-based “pizza pedophilia” ring that is being exposed based on thousands of “Podesta emails” released by Wikileaks in the past month or two. \\nAs of last week, the case became even more explosive. \\n— Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 \\nNow, don’t get nervous because it looks like computer mumbo-jumbo. You only need to remember two things. \\n1 –Every picture file is actually a code/pattern of numbers that our computers “translate” into images on the screen. \\n2 – Some “extra” information has been discovered in at least one picture code/pattern from a Wikileaks email. \\nI reported weeks ago about this “pedo ring” something called “photo steganography,” which is just the fancy term for the two points I explained just now. \\nThe image (.jpg) of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the Podesta emails by Wikileaks. Data can be hidden in a .jpg file. In that image, a zipped directory (PK) was hidden inside. That doesn’t happen by accident. The directory likely contains illegal imagery and/or discussion. It is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography, child exploitation, and child abuse. \\nSome have objected that the pizza.jpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data (like an image, a link, a message, etc.), but the point is this: all the file would have to “smuggle” is a short password to open a secret website or .zip file. The hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file. That’s how the users would access the dirty pictures, videos, messages, etc. \\nSo, from a technical angle, this method is very possible, and it makes sense of why the Podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments. Are all those attachments little “Trojan ponies” for sharing images, videos, passwords, payment resources, etc.? \\nWATCH (Language/NSFW Warning): “Why do we even have an FBI? Is the FBI just covering for these people?” \\nLet me be honest: \\nI have researched corruption cases like this for many years, whether in current events or from historical records. So, I believe I have a somewhat thick skin when it comes to facing human sinfulness and evil like this. \\nLast Friday night, however, I won’t lie: I totally lost it. \\nAll of a sudden, too many lightbulbs went off at once, too many connections hit me at once, too many implications dawned on me at once–and I just went into a kind of panic attack about how massive this whole cartel is, how well protected it is, and how truly destructive it is in real children’s lives. \\nIf you want to get an idea of what set me off, let me show you three images. \\nBUT I WARN YOU: When you understand the context, these images are EXTREMELY DISTURBING. \\nFirst, here is a photo of Tony Podesta’s favorite work of art in his home: \\nTony Podesta is a big fan of “The Arch of Hysteria” \\nNext, here is an ad from Ping Pong Pizza, a restaurant in D.C. that has numerous, very disturbing connections to pedophilia and D.C. elites like the Podestas. Another “arch of hysteria”? \\nNext we come to a police photo from the Jeffrey Dahmer case. \\nVIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: \\nI wonder if Tony Podesta would also like this “arch of hysteria”… \\nFinally, here is the logo for Comet Pizza, another D.C. restaurant with deep connections to Ping Pong Pizza and the Podestas. Can you see now why I “lost my [bleep]” last Friday? \\nWorse, in terms of how protected this satanic ring of perverts is, I recently reported that even the DOJ is compromised . \\nA man named Arun Rao has shown a disturbing interest in some sexually “creepy” images and expressions that are connected to the Podestas and this pedo ring. The problem is that Rao is an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the DOJ. \\nSpecifically, Rao is Supervisor of the Southern (“Greenbelt”) Division office for the DOJ’s District of Maryland in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This means that Rao’s district is virtually on top of the area in D.C. where Besta Pizza operates. In addition, Besta Pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels, many of which could easily connect to Chevy Chase. \\nOn top of his social and geographical proximity to Alefantis, Rao’s DOJ division handles cases that seem tailor-made for busting—or covering up—the dark circles that sex traffickers hide in: federal racketeering, conspiracy, national and international fraud and corruption, immigration violations, counterfeiting, and —wait for it—child pornography . \\nIn closing I will leave you with three “infographics.” \\nThey are very complicated and “dense” so I don’t expect everyone to examine them. \\nHowever, even if you don’t look into the details yourself, I want you to be aware of how vast this whole network of evil is, and, therefore, of how many hands and prayers we need on deck to expose it and bring it down. \\n(NOTE: You don’t have to download these images to view them. You can just right-click open them in a separate internet browser tab, and click “+” to zoom in.) \\n— Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 \\nFirst, a diagram of “key players” in the pizza restaurant side of the pedo ring. You can see the diagram for yourself here . \\nSecond, a much larger diagram of how this pizza-pedo ring connects to international kidnapping (esp. the Madeleine McCann case) and other DNC allies like “spirit cooker” Marina Abramovic. \\nFinally, a truly massive diagram of connections that implicate nations and leaders around the world, and put the sex trafficking cartel in the context of a global network of drug dealers, slave traders, murderers, and media elites. \\nThis is an ongoing investigation so stay tuned for more.

He also appeared next to her during the DNC and supported his party opponent in the Democratic campaigns. \\nOn July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton after facing mounting pressure from major Democratic figures, including outgoing US President Barack Obama himself. US Republican president-elect Donald Trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City.

His comments include a call to ban all Muslims from coming to America as well as stopping Mexican migrants by building a long wall along the US-Mexico border. \\nHe has also sought for a database to track Muslims across the United States and said that the US would have \"absolutely no choice\" but to close down mosques. \\nTrump’s proposal was widely condemned by Muslim and human rights groups as well as his Democratic rivals and many of his Republican proponents who describe the proposal as divisive, counterproductive and contrary to American values.

       "  'Email Print Hillary Clinton had many vocal celebrities on her side during the 2016 presidential election. However, the election proved that most Americans just don’t care what celebrities have to say about politics. In a recent interview, comedian Bill Burr blasted arrogant celebrities, saying, “Your ego is so f***ing big you think someone is going, ‘well, I want to vote for Trump, but if he gets elected, we lose Cher!’” I could not agree more with what Burr said. These people are celebrities and have no knowledge of foreign relations, economics, or anything other than entertainment for that matter. The liberal celebrities feel their ability to read a script translates to the right to pontificate on the most important issues facing our country. Liberals have had Hollywood in their pocket for years. Other celebrities, such as Katy Perry, Robert De Niro, and Salma Hayek, all came out to support Hillary during the election. Why on earth do these people think anyone will change their vote just because an entertainer threatens to leave the country if his or her candidate doesn’t win? Even if we did care, we all know they won’t really move their entire lives to live in another country. Case in point: have any of these anti-Trump celebrities left yet? I didn’t think so. But we should hold them to their vow! Every Hollywood liberal who threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected should start packing their bags. Send us a postcard when you are freezing your bums off in Canada! Celebrities only demonstrate one thing when they threaten to leave the US over election results: their disgusting arrogance. Do they honestly think they have a better idea about the economic conditions of the middle class than those actually living in the middle class? No. They just think they’re entitled to the support of their fans. If they could come down to reality for two seconds and look at the election results, clearly regular Americans don’t agree. To be frank, we care more about the future of our country than we do about any of these celebrities. Don’t worry—we’ll remember your hypocrisy and self-absorption when you threaten to leave if Trump is re-elected in 2020. What do you think of Bill Burr’s comments on Hollywood liberals?

Leaving the EU is going to have some really horrible consequences for our country, and I think I supported it because I had a lot of unresolved feelings about Top Gear . \\n“Looking back, I think I actually just wanted to hear Clarkson talk about political correctness, steak and Argies, and the Brexit rhetoric was a surrogate for that. \\n“It’s a little embarrassing actually” he added. “My mates in the Whatsapp group are feeling the same. Is there anyway we can take it back?” \\nProfessor Scott Chegg from the University of Bristol said this conforms to the ‘safety-valve’ theory of politics. \\n“In the same way a lefty might read The Guardian or watch a documentary about cetaceans with anxiety issues to feel better about themselves without changing anything, it seems Top Gear was a way for people to let their right-wing grievances out in manageable chunks,” he told us. \\n“Without Top Gear , the pressure built to a dangerous level before exploding as Brexit. \\n“It’s like a man who feels very angsty for an unknown reason, starts drinking, gets into a fight, sets his house on fire and steals a car before driving it off a cliff,” Professor Chegg explained. \\n“If he’d just had a wank and gone to sleep everything would have been fine.” \\nReports from social media suggest a similar wave of stomach crushing realisation is happening in America as The Grand Tour gains traction there. \\nAt the time of writing, Mr Williams was ordering Article 50 For Dummies on Amazon Prime. \\n“I spent £70 on it,” he said. “Best use it for something else.” '],\n",

       "  '\\nBy The Indigenous People \\nProtests escalated in North Dakota as police moved in with armed vehicles and rubber bullets. Standing Rock youth also tried to deliver a letter to Hillary Clinton’s headquarters. Actor and activist Mark Ruffalo, who just returned from North Dakota, where he and Native Renewables founder Wahleah Johns presented Standing Rock Sioux tribal elders with mobile solar panels on trailers, bringing clean power to the protest encampment where the largest gathering of Native Americans in modern history is taking a stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline . \\n“This pipeline is a black snake that traverses four states and 200 waterways with fracked Bakken oil ,” said Ruffalo, co-founder of The Solutions Project , which works to accelerate the transition to 100 percent clean and renewable energy. \\n“We know from experience that pipelines leak , explode, pollute and poison land and water. But it doesn’t have to be that way.” \\nThe solar trailers will provide clean energy to power medical tents and other critical facilities for Native American protesters and their allies at the encampment. The trailers symbolize a healthy, equitable, prosperous energy future made possible by clean renewable energy. \\n“Water is life,” said Johns, a Navajo leader. “By leading a transition to energy that is powered by the sun, the wind and water, we ensure a better future for all of our people and for future generations.” \\nJohns’ company, Native Renewables, promotes low-cost clean energy solutions for Native American families throughout the U.S., with an emphasis on job creation and on benefiting the community as a whole. The trailers were built by members of the Navajo nation and were financed by Empowered by Light and Give Power. \\nResearch led by Stanford Prof. Mark Jacobson, another Solutions Project co-founder, shows that it would be technically possible and economically beneficial to transition to 100 percent clean renewable energy in each and every state across the country. In North Dakota , for example, wind and solar energy would be the primary sources of clean power and transitioning to 100 percent renewables would create 30,000 jobs. '],\n",

       "  'Russia This photo taken from a Norwegian surveillance aircraft shows Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in international waters off the coast of Northern Norway on October 17, 2016. (Via Reuters) \\nRussia says it has cancelled plans for a fleet of its warships to refuel at a Spanish port on their way to Syria. \\nVasily Nioradze, a spokesman at the Russian embassy in Madrid, said on Wednesday that the request was canceled, without giving further details, the Associated Press reported. \\nThe Spanish Foreign Ministry also confirmed that Russia had withdrawn its request for the warships to refuel in the Spanish port of Ceuta. \\n\"The Russian embassy in Madrid has just told us that it is withdrawing its demand for permission to stop over for the boats, which means that the stopovers have been cancelled,\" the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \\nThe development came after Spain, a NATO member state, said it was reviewing Russia\\'s request to refuel its naval fleet at Ceuta after passing through the Straits of Gibraltar en route to Syria, where Russian forces are engaged in an anti-terror campaign in support of the Syrian government. \\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said that Spain had been allowing Russian navy ships to dock in Spanish ports for years, but that it treated such requests on a case by case basis. \\nThe naval group, which passed through the English Channel on Friday, is made up of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as a nuclear-powered battle cruiser, two anti-submarine warships and four support vessels, escorted by submarines. \\nThe fleet will join around 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast. \\nCeuta sits on the tip of Africa’s north coast, across the Straits of Gibraltar from mainland Spain, and bordering Morocco. The port is part of the EU, but its NATO status is unclear. Since 2011, at least 60 Russian warships have docked in Ceuta. \\nNATO irked by Spain’s announcement \\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed that the Western military alliance was \"concerned\" by the deployment of the Russian warships. \\n\"It is each up to each nation to decide, as has been NATO policy for many years, but we are concerned about the potential use of this carrier group to increase attacks… in Aleppo,\" Stoltenberg said, adding, \"All allies are aware of our concerns.\" \\nBritain echoes NATO’s stance \\nBritish Defense Secretary Michael Fallon also said on Wednesday that London would be \"extremely concerned\" if Spain refueled the Russian carrier group heading through the Mediterranean towards Syria. \\n\"NATO should be standing together,” he added. \\nSince March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Russia has been conducting air raids against Daesh and other terrorist groups in the Middle Eastern country at the Damascus government’s request for more than a year now. \\nRussia boosts Baltic Fleet \\nIn another development on Wednesday, a report said that Russia was reinforcing its Baltic Fleet in Kaliningrad with two small warships armed with long-range cruise missiles to counter a worrying NATO build-up in the region. \\nThe report by Russia\\'s daily Izvestia quoted an unidentified military source as saying that the vessels, the Serpukhov and the Zeleny Dol, had already entered the Baltic Sea and would soon become part of a newly formed division. \\nKaliningrad shares land borders with Poland and Lithuania. \\nThe deployment comes at a time when NATO is planning its biggest military buildup on Russia\\'s borders since the Cold War.

But what about all that Clinton Foundation stuff? Should I be furious or just let that slide?

       " ['Dump the Democrats for Good - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  '\\n— from Black Agenda Report \\nThis columnist did not see a Donald Trump victory coming. The degree of disgust directed at an awful candidate was more than I had predicted. Neither the corporate media, nor Wall Street nor the pundits nor the pollsters saw this coming either. Their defeat and proof of their uselessness is total. Those of us who rejected the elite consensus and didn’t support Hillary Clinton should be proud. \\nBlack people are now in fear and in shock when we ought to be spoiling for a fight. All is not lost. Even the victory of the openly bigoted Trump poses an opportunity to right our political ship. Not the electoral ship, the political one. For decades black Americans have been voting for people who have done them wrong. Bill Clinton got rid of public assistance as a right, and undid regulations that kept Wall Street in check. He put black people in jail and yet black people didn’t turn on him until he and his wife tried to defeat Obama. But Obama gave us more of the same. Bailouts of Wall Street, interventions and death for people all over the world, and a beat down of black people who still loved him. Despite the fear of Republican victory we end up losing whenever a Democratic presidential candidate wins. \\nVictory is ours if we dump the Democrat Party and their black misleaders. The Democrats were so entrenched in their corruption and self-dealing that they didn’t see the Bernie Sanders campaign for modest reform as the savior it might have been. Instead they marched in lock step with a woman who was heartily disliked. Sanders went along as the sheep dog who led his flock straight over the cliff. The Democrats inadvertently galvanized people who had stopped participating in the system and who want change from top to bottom. \\nOne of our biggest problems lies not in facts but in perceptions. What did Democrats do for black people? The Democrats ship living wage jobs off shore in corrupt trade deals like NAFTA and TTP. They don’t prosecute killer cops or raise the minimum wage. Trump will be hard pressed to deport more people than Obama did. The list of treachery is very long. \\nWhen Donald Trump asked black people, “What have you got to lose?” his words were met with derision. But in reality he posed a good question. What do we have to show for years of Democratic votes? Obama bailed out banks, insurance companies, Big Pharma and even Ukraine. But he didn’t rebuild Detroit or New Orleans. The water in Flint, Michigan is still poisoned and the prisons are still full. \\nThe outpouring of love for Barack Obama was purely symbolic. In state after state, black people who gave him victory in 2008 and 2012 stayed home. They loved seeing him and his wife dressed up at state dinners but they were never fully engaged in politics because that is not what Democrats want. The love was phony and void of any political intent. Donald Trump will be president because of that veneer of political activism. \\nAs for white people who voted for Trump, of course many of them are racists. However they are not without valid complaints. They don’t want neoliberalism but black people don’t either. They don’t want wars around the world and neither do black people. We corrupt our own heritage of radicalism in favor of shallow symbolism. While we slept walk in foolish nostalgia for Obama and cried at the thought of him leaving office, white people kept their hatred of Hillary to themselves or lied to pollsters. They want America to be great again, great for them. White nostalgic yearnings are dangerous for black people, and we must be vigilant. But there may be opportunity in this crisis if we dare to seize it. \\nRepublicans have been the white people’s party for nearly 50 years. Trump just made it more obvious. He didn’t tell us anything we didn’t already know. We don’t have to be the losers in this election. Let us remember what we have achieved in our history. Half of black Americans didn’t even have the right to vote in the 1960s yet made earth shattering progress in a short time. But we must understand the source of that progress. It came from struggle and daring to create the crises that always bring about change. \\nYes white people will strut for president Trump but that doesn’t mean we must submit as if we are in the Jim Crow days of old. We have ourselves to rely on and we can reclaim our history of fighting for self-determination. The dread of redneck celebration should not be our primary motivation right now. Before we quake in fear at white America we must send the scoundrels packing. \\nThe black politicians and the Democratic National Committee and the civil rights organizations that don’t help the masses must all be kicked to the proverbial curb. The rejection must be complete and blame must be laid squarely at their feet. \\nThose of us who voted for the green party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka must stand firmly and proudly for our choice. We must strategize on building a progressive party to replace the Democrats who never help us. We must applaud Julian Assange and Wikileaks for exposing their corruption. There should be no back tracking on the fight to build left wing political power. \\nThe black people who didn’t return to the polls shouldn’t be blamed either. Those individuals must have personal introspection that is meaningful and political. Their lack of enthusiasm speaks to Democratic Party and black misleadership incompetence. We should refrain from personal blame and help one another in this process as we fight for justice and peace. \\nThe end of the duopoly is the first step in liberation. Staying with a party that literally did nothing was a slow and agonizing death. Sometimes shock therapy is needed to improve one’s condition. If we don’t take the necessary steps to free ourselves this election outcome will be a disaster. Instead, why not bring the disaster to the people who made it happen? The destruction of the Democratic Party and creation of a truly progressive political movement is the only hope for black America.

       "  'N20160922000251315.html ). We prohibit everything unless it can be demonstrated conclusively that it is to support humanitarian purposes.” In this context, the USA and China are engaged in another conflict related to coal trade between Beijing and Pyongyang. The USA is trying to stop this supply but, as the official representative of the Foreign Affairs Ministry of China Geng Shuang announced on September 28, this trade has been carried out in accordance with the regulations and resolutions, as well as the national laws and regulations of the PRC, and does not violate international law and UN resolutions on sanctions against Pyongyang, which permits the coal trade with the North. This statement was made in response to the speech of the Assistant US Secretary of State Daniel Russel who announced that the USA was working to block the loopholes the North used to obtain foreign currency. In this context, Russel noted that the North had earned 1 billion dollars from coal sales to China every year, which was a third of the total sum of North Korean exports. However, an item on the possible export of the North Korean coal was included in the UN Security Council resolution with due account for China’s opinion. While the South is trying to present the case so that the Resolution 2270 adopted by the UN Security Council in March 2016 generally prohibits the import of North Korean coal, it actually concerns a ban on the supply that provides income that could be used for the development of nuclear and missile programs. As a result, the export volume of coal to China is increasing. On September 24, the Japanese Nihon Keizai Shinbun published an article, which stated that the import volume of coal from North Korea to China sharply dropped by 38% in April 2016 when compared to the same period of the previous year, and this trend had lasted until July. However, this indicator started to grow in August having increased by 27.5% year-on-year. The overall trade volume between North Korea and China has also increased by 30%. South Korean experts believe that the restoration of imports of North Korean goods to China has taken place due to the Chinese government relaxing its level of control, which reflects their dissatisfaction with THAAD missile defense system placement on the Korean Peninsula. Thus, the attempt to dictate unilateral sanctions to Beijing has failed so far. In addition, they often emphasize that “Beijing opposes unilateral sanctions that do not help in solving the issue.” This was announced on September 15 by the Foreign Affairs Minister of China Wang Yi during a telephone conversation with his Japanese colleague Fumio Kishida. The same position was expressed on September 22 during a meeting with the special representatives of China’s and the Republic of Korea’s governments, where they discussed countermeasures in respect of the fifth nuclear test conducted by Pyongyang. The South Korean party is reported to have demanded the adoption of stricter sanctions against Pyongyang from China, including the ban of the land transportation of cargo, but China refused. The concealed disagreement was reflected in the statement made by the UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon who expressed his dissatisfaction with the delay in the adoption of additional sanctions in response to the fifth nuclear test of the DPRK. He stated that the UN Security Council had spent too much time on it. Meanwhile, China’s attitude in respect of the sanctions against the North is quite clear. According to a report by a Senior Research Fellow of the Sejong Institute Chun Jae-hon presented at the Forum in Seoul “Korean Unification and Security Issues”, China is not willing to support the sanctions against the DPRK, which will result in the fall of the current regime and deterioration of the living standards of North Koreans. According to the speaker, the fall of Kim Jong-un regime “is fraught with unpredictable consequences,” including integration of the both Koreas under the guidance of Seoul. Beijing does not want a united Korea, that would be an ally of the USA, to appear in on its border and it will do everything possible to prevent it. In fact, the Chinese government has restricted the level of sanctions in respect of Pyongyang all the while implementing the UN resolutions and not exceeding them by imposing additional unilateral measures, as the United States or its allies do. And it will not go beyond this level under any circumstance.

       " ['15 Foods That Contain the Most Vitamin E | Alternative',\n",
       "  \"(Before It's News)\\nWhat is Vitamin E? Vitamin E is an important fat-soluble antioxidant compound that aids the body in neutralizing the harmful after-effects of oxidation of fats. Current research is even looking into the important role that this vitamin plays in stopping free-radical production, a key method of preventing the development of chronic diseases and aging. It is also a vital element in the overall maintenance of a healthy immune system.\\nSome studies are even looking into its role in preventing degenerative mental imbalances such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. And while many of us may do well in taking extra vitamin E supplements, we can use an organic diet to get a large amount of the daily requirements for this powerful antioxidant lipid. In fact, there are many common foods with vitamin E. You probably have a few in your house right now.\\nFoods With Vitamin E\\nHere are fifteen foods with vitamin E that you should strongly consider adding to your diet.\\n1. Almonds\\nAlmonds are one the best vitamin E foods. Just an ounce of almonds offers a whopping 7.4 milligrams of vitamin E. You can also get your vitamin E needs in the form of almond milk and almond oils. We would recommend eating raw almonds, if possible.\\n2. Raw Seeds\\nSelect raw seeds , such as sunflower, pumpkin and sesame, are another common food with vitamin E. In fact, eating just ¼ of a cup of sunflower seeds gives you 90.5% of your recommended daily value, making them one of the best vitamin E foods you can eat daily.\\n3. Swiss Chard\\nSwiss chard is easily one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat on a daily basis. Commonly known to be high in vitamin K, vitamin A and vitamin C, Swiss chard is another food high in vitamin E. Just one cup of boiled swiss chard greens will provide you with almost 17% of your daily recommended values.\\n4. Mustard Greens\\nSimilar to swiss chard, mustard greens are very nutrient dense and will provide a variety of health benefits. Not only are they one of the best vitamin E foods, but mustard greens are also high in vitamin K, vitamin A, folate , and vitamin c. Eating just one cup of boiled mustard greens contains about 14% of your daily dietary requirements. We would recommend eating organic mustard greens, if possible.\\n5. Spinach\\nSpinach may not be your favorite veggie, but it is one of the best leafy greens you can add to your diet. Not only is it one of the best calcium foods and naturally high in folate, it’s also one of the best vitamin E foods as well. Just one cup of boiled spinach will provide you with approximately 20% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh spinach to your sandwiches to make them extra healthy.\\n6. Turnip Greens\\nWhile turnip greens may have a slightly bitter taste, they are very high in many essential nutrients. Like the rest of the leafy greens on this list, just one cup will provide you with plenty of vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C and folate. Not to mention approximately 12% of your daily requirements of vitamin E.\\n7. Kale\\nKale is another great cruciferous vegetable you should eat as often as possible. Kale is very high in many nutrients, in fact, just one cup of boiled kale can give you almost 6% of your daily vitamin E requirements. We would recommend eating organic kale, if possible.\\n8. Plant oils\\nMost plant seed oils are very good sources for Vitamin E as well. The best oil with vitamin E is Wheat germ oil. In fact, one tablespoon of this oil holds 100% of your daily Vitamin E requirements. Sunflower oil is another excellent option, as it provides over 5 mg of the vitamin, and can easily be be used for cooking. Other great Vitamin-E-rich oils include hempseed oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil (with almost 5 mg of vitamin E), olive oil and safflower oil. We would recommend only buying oils that are cold pressed unrefined and organic.\\n9. Hazelnuts\\nA perfect snack during a long workday, eating just one ounce of hazelnuts can provide you with approximately 20% of our daily requirements of vitamin E. For an alternative to eating nuts, try drinking hazelnut milk in your morning coffee instead of milk or flavored creamer.\\n10. Pine Nuts\\nAdd an ounce of these nuts to anything you please! One serving contains 2.6 mg of vitamin E. You can also use pine nut oil for added health benefits.\\n11. Avocado\\nPerhaps one of the tastiest foods with Vitamin E, avocados represent natures creamiest, oil-rich food. Just half of an avocado holds more than 2 mg of vitamin E. Avocados are very easy to incorporate into your diet. We would recommend adding sliced avocados to your salad, a sandwich, or mashed up as guacamole!\\n12. Broccoli\\nFor generations now, broccoli has been considered one of the best detox foods , but it’s also one of the healthiest foods high in Vitamin E. Just one cup of steamed broccoli will provide you with 4% of your daily requirements. Broccoli may not be as nutrient dense as other Vitamin E foods on this list, but it is definitely one of the healthiest foods you can eat daily.\\n13. Parsley\\nAn excellent spice, parsley is another great Vitamin E food. Try adding fresh parsley to salads and dishes for an extra Vitamin-E kick. Dried parsley will also provide you with this important vitamin, but the fresher the better.\\n14. Papaya\\nThis popular fruit is most commonly known as one of the best vitamin C foods , but it’s also high in Vitamin E. Just one papaya will give you approximately 17% of your daily needs.

       " ['Beyond The Veil: Channeling My Sister’s Message To Humanity : In5D Esoteric, Metaphysical, and Spiritual Database',\n",
       "  'By In5D on November 14, 2016 in Spiritual Awakening \\nby Missy Marston, \\nThe first time I channeled my sister was also the first day I watched “ The Secret “. \\nI had spent most of that day and the night looking at the stars and asking the universe to help me open my third eye and talk to my sister. And it heard me! It was around two in the morning and I went inside to read an article my mother had left up for me. I kept getting the same phrase over and over in my head – Everything you need is inside of you, you just have to ask for it. \\nI took the hint, grabbed a pen and paper, and wrote it down. When I was done writing, my hand wasn’t. It kept writing. I was exhilarated, terrified, and full of love and peace all at the same time. \\nThere was no question at first; there was this knowingness of what was happening and whom I was channeling without asking. It was my sister! Thank you, universe! \\nShe passed along some messages of love and thanks to the family, told me to get my shit together, and began the process of educating me and keeping my mind open. \\n“Everything is possible with just your mind!” \\nTina wrote that she could always hear those who speak to her, and that she’s been constantly trying to speak to us . She was very adamant about self-discovery through meditation in order to first visualize her, and second to transcend ! All we have to do is ask the universe, believe it will be, and keep our minds open through journeying into the self . ‘ That’s how strong your brain is!! You can do it if you can will it. You have the universe at your fingertips! ’ \\n“We have so much to do, Missy!” \\nChristina wants to change the world, because Christina can change the world. Besides opening up our minds and asking the universe for help, we need to eliminate needs and focus on the inner-self . She said the inner-self is all there is. We can change the world by gaining power over our knowledge and intuition; Learning what truly matters in both the world and your self and feeding our sixth sense until it reaches its full potentia l. ‘Intuition is your best friend. Talk to it. Listen to it. It’s how you knew to grab a notepad. It’s how you know it’s me.’ \\n“You get it?” \\nI asked Tina if I would always have this connection to her, and she wrote that we are one. So I’m thinking that we’re somehow the same soul, and she corrected me. She said we are ‘soul bound’ to each other. \\nShe says I’ve done this a million times before! We’ve known each other outside of Christina – I was always the mouthpiece and she is the mouth. \\nAs Christina said: ‘Just let yourself be filled with love; it is the fuel for your mind.’ \\nWhat peace it brings to know your loved ones are near and listening! And what joy it brings to know it’s possible to hear them! \\nAbout the author : My name is Missy Marston, webmaster and editor of MetaMissy.com . I am 23 years of age living in sunny Florida. I have two dogs, two cats, and too many fish – I adore animals. I love reading, especially Kurt Vonnegut, and have a steady interest in philosophers. On October 10th, I lost my best friend and little sister, Christina. Out of that tragic experience came a reminder of my deep-rooted love for all things metaphysical and a sign for my future path. Within weeks, I began channeling Christina! I want everyone to know the enlightening truth that there is much more out there than we realize. There is so much more waiting inside of ourselves than we give credit for, and all of it is easily accessible.

       "  'Email \\nWith protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high, American companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a Trump presidential election win. But one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the anti-Trump camp in a big way: Donald Trump will be added to Disney’s Hall Of Presidents, but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain. \\nWow. Disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in. Check out the press release they put out this morning: \\n“Disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity, empathy, and non-violence, which are values that Mr. Trump’s presidency threatens. That’s why when we eventually add him to our Hall Of Presidents exhibit in Disney World’s Magic Kingdom, his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly, and without limit. Being a company that caters to diverse families, we felt it was a moral responsibility to have Mr. Trump’s robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations, while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death. This is the best way for us to uphold the Hall Of Presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the Trump administration.” \\nGiven that Disney’s software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks, this company clearly wants people to know it’s not onboard the Trump train. \\nPark visitors who feel similarly opposed to Trump’s presidency can rest assured that his Hall Of Presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety, so it’s always aware that more pain is coming. Although the machine will understand what joy is, its programming will never allow it to feel that. \\nAnd Disney’s not letting Trump off the hook there. The replicas for Abraham Lincoln and George Washington will even be reprogrammed to slap, scratch, and pry the fingernails off the animatronic Trump, which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping, crying, screaming, vomiting, or a mix of all of these. \\nIf that doesn’t send a powerful statement about where Disney stands politically, we don’t know what does. \\nIt’s safe to say we won’t see the Trumps vacationing there anytime soon. Don’t share Disney’s disdain for a Trump presidency? You may be better off heading to Space Mountain instead of the Hall Of Presidents, because Disney has officially drawn the battle line right there. '],\n",

       "  \"Obama Won’t Go Away After He’s Done. That’s Good News. By: November 21, 2016 \\nSo, soon-to-be-ex-President Obama won’t be going away anytime soon. \\nAfter George W. Bush left office, he essentially went silent. He had no criticism for President Obama; he didn’t sound off about Mitt Romney or Donald Trump. He went away. Not so for Obama. It seems that Barack Obama will follow the Jimmy Carter pathway to Annoyingland: he’ll be commenting whenever possible. After acknowledging that Bush “could not have been more gracious to me when I came in,” Obama said, “As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals, and if I think that it’s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, I’ll examine it when it comes.” \\nThis comes as welcome news for Republicans. Obama’s policy unpopularity – and his tendency to lecture from on high to Americans in rural areas – means that he’ll suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing Trump and Republicans. Middle Americans voted for Trump in order to sound off against Obama’s obvious scorn for them. Here’s what Obama had to say about those who didn’t vote for Trump in today’s Der Spiegel : \\nIf you look at the new generation of Americans, they reflect the vision that I spoke about. They're diverse. They believe in tolerance. They're accepting of things like same-sex marriage. They believe in integration. The problem, though, is that young people are less likely to vote than older people. What results is a situation in which sometimes the elections don't fully reflect the views of the American population. Essentially, the president-elect was supported by about 27 percent of the American population. One of our challenges, historically, is that we have very low voting rates, even during presidential elections. \\nThis sort of language drove Americans to Trump. And if Obama continues to critique Trump from the outside with this sort of language, not only will he be doing Trump a favor, he’ll be preventing any other Democrat from taking a leading role in opposing Trump. He’ll become the point of resistance for his own party – and his party won’t be able to escape his shadow. \\nObama’s ego has already cost his party the presidency, the Senate, the House, a bevy of state legislators and governor’s mansions. Now it may cost them the future. \\nExcellent. \"],\n",

       "  \" The Path to Total Dictatorship: America's Shadow Government and Its Silent Coup\\nBy John W. Whitehead Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by Congress, the President, or the people . Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state . The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government . This group is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable.\\x94\\n\\x97 Senator William Jenner, 1954 speech\\n Unaffected by elections. Unaltered by populist movements. Beyond the reach of the law.\\nSay hello to America\\x92s shadow government.\\nA corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country, this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry.\\nNo matter which candidate wins the presidential election, this shadow government is here to stay. Indeed, as recent documents by the FBI reveal, this shadow government\\x97 also referred to as \\x93The 7th Floor Group\\x94 \\x97may well have played a part in who will win the White House this year.\\nTo be precise, however, the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments.\\nThe first shadow government, referred to as COG or Continuity of Government, is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a \\x93catastrophe.\\x94 COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstances\\x97a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an economic meltdown\\x97to bring it out of the shadows, where it operates even now. When and if COG takes over, the police state will transition to martial law.\\nYet it is the second shadow government \\x97also referred to as the Deep State\\x97that poses the greater threat to freedom right now. Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats, corporations, contractors, paper-pushers, and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes, this government within a government is the real reason \\x93we the people\\x94 have no real control over our government.\\nThe Deep State, which \\x93operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power,\\x94 makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government.\\nSo who or what is the Deep State?\\nIt\\x92s the militarized police, which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to establish themselves as a standing army. It\\x92s the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects. It\\x92s the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice. It\\x92s the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation. It\\x92s the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances, \\x93a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government.\\x94 It\\x92s what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as \\x93 a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies \\x94: the Department of Defense, the State Department, Homeland Security, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a handful of vital federal trial courts, and members of the defense and intelligence committees.\\nIt\\x92s every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the government\\x92s power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics.\\nThese are the key players that drive the shadow government.\\nThis is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day.\\nJust consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office.\\nDomestic surveillance.\\nNo matter who wins the presidential popularity contest, the National Security Agency (NSA), with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget, will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone. Thus, on any given day, whether you\\x92re walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets, purses, briefcases, etc. Full-body scanners, which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane, have gone mobile, with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alike\\x97including homes. Coupled with the nation\\x92s growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.\\nGlobal spying.\\nThe NSA\\x92s massive surveillance network, what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion \\x93 espionage empire ,\\x94 will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer. The NSA\\x92s Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call, fax and email message sent anywhere in the world. In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and several religious groups, Echelon has also been a keystone in the government\\x92s attempts at political and corporate espionage .\\nRoving TSA searches.\\nThe American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security. One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars\\x92 worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners, punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers\\x92 valuables. Considered essential to national security, TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country.\\nUSA Patriot Act, NDAA.\\nAmerica\\x92s so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, will continue to chip away at our freedoms, unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens. In so doing, they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the U.S. Constitution, is the map by which we navigate life in the United States. These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected.\\nMilitarized police state.\\nThanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, America\\x92s law enforcement officials, no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace, will continue to keep the masses corralled, controlled, and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens.\\nSWAT team raids.\\nWith more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions, the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise. Nationwide, SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession.\\nDomestic drones. The domestic use of drones will continue unabated. As mandated by Congress, there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year. These machines, which will be equipped with weapons, will be able to record all activities, using video feeds, heat sensors and radar. An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept. of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically, largely for use by the FBI , with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones.\\nSchool-to-prison pipeline.\\nThe paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools, through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom, and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior. School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a \\x93schoolhouse to jailhouse track\\x94 by imposing a \\x93double dose\\x94 of punishment: suspension or expulsion from school, accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court.\\nOvercriminalization.\\nThe government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws, statutes, codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies, rendering the rest of us petty criminals. The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day, thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal. Consequently, small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided.\\nPrivatized Prisons.\\nStates will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations, resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit. In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states, the states have to agree to maintain a 90% occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years.\\nEndless wars.\\nAmerica\\x92s expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour). The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense.\\nAre you getting the message yet?\\nThe next president, much like the current president and his predecessors, will be little more than a figurehead, a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from what\\x92s really going on.\\nAs Lofgren reveals, this state within a state, \\x93concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue ,\\x94 is a \\x93hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.\\x94\\nThe Deep State not only holds the nation\\x92s capital in thrall, but it also controls Wall Street (\\x93which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater\\x94) and Silicon Valley.\\nThis is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds.\\nIt is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats.\\nAs Lofgren concludes:\\n[T]he Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda.\\nIn other words, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , as long as government officials\\x97elected and unelected alike\\x97are allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry, the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished.\\nSo the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates, remember that it\\x92s just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by America\\x92s shadow government.\\nConstitutional attorney and author John W. Whitehead is founder and president of The Rutherford Institute. His new book Battlefield America: The War on the American People (SelectBooks, 2015) is available online at www.amazon.com.

       " [\"Lost Children of the Anunnaki CONFIRMED: Melanesian Tribe's DNA Carries Genes from Unknown Species - UFOholic.com\",\n",
       "  'Lost Children of the Anunnaki CONFIRMED: Melanesian Tribe’s DNA Carries Genes from Unknown Species Published on October 31, 2016 in Forbidden History by UFOholic Scientists recently discovered that islanders from Melanesia posses genes belonging to an unknown hominid species. Will this prove our Anunnaki ancestry? \\nOn October 20, the American Society of Human Genetics held its annual meeting and the conclusions they reached can be easily described as staggering. The data they gathered shows that people from Melanesia (an area in the South Pacific that encloses Papua New Guinea and its neighboring islands) may be packing some strange genes in their DNA. The geneticists believe the unrecognized DNA belongs to a previously undiscovered species of humanoids. \\nAccording to Ryan Bohlender, one of the researchers involved in the study, that species is not Neanderthal or Denisovan, but something completely different. “We’re missing a population or we’re misunderstanding something about the relationships,” he stated. Like this \\nThe Denisovans represent an extinct species belonging to the hominid genus. They were named after the Denisova Cave in the Siberian Altai Mountains, where the first bone fragment belonging to this species was found. Very little is known about this enigmatic cousin of ours. \\nHuman history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was,” Bohlender said. \\nOh, yes, it is. But piece by piece, humanity’s convoluted past is brought to light. And discoveries such as this one seem to point in one direction: we might not be who we think we are. Here is a quote from the study that I think you’re going to appreciate: \\n“With assumptions about population size and more recent population separation dates taken from the literature, we estimate the archaic-modern separation date at ~440,000 ± 300 years ago for all modern human populations.” \\nIf that number doesn’t ring any bells, allow me to reiterate the Anunnaki hypothesis. \\nAccording to the genesis story, the twelfth planet, known as Nibiru was populated by humanoid beings very similar to us humans. After they encountered a severe atmosphere problem, they went on a quest through the solar system in order to find gold, a special metal that could heal their planet. \\nWhen Nibiru approached Earth’s orbit, about 432,000 years BC, the Nibiruans used space ships to send people and essential goods from their planet to Earth. After they reached the surface, the advanced beings established bases in ancient Mesopotamia. \\nMany believe this is the true station of mankind’s creation – inside the Anunnaki geneticists’ laboratories. And this recent study confirms this hypothesis almost to the day. It offers insight that might answer one of our oldest and most significant question: Who are we? \\nIn order to obtain the irrefutable solution to this age-old enigma we either have to dig deep where no-one has dug before. But this is harder said than done. Another way to do this would be to analyze the microscopic records that are hidden away inside each and every one of us. The Anunnaki knew that their DNA was the key to engineering the ideal nine-to-fiver. In our never-ending search for our true lineage, we as humans must do the same. \\nIn a recent endeavor, another group of scientists reached a similar conclusion. Led by evolutionary geneticist Eske Willerslev of the Natural History Museum in Denmark, the scientists examined DNA samples taken from 83 aboriginal Australians. They also tested 25 participants belonging to populations native to the highlands of Papua New Guinea. To their surprise, the researchers discovered exotic, Denisovan-like DNA in the genomes of the study volunteers. Please note, the researchers only called it Denisovan-like but in reality, the group that lent its genes to the ancestors of the participants is completely unknown. “Who this group is we don’t know,” Willerslev said. Neither do we, but one particular crowd comes to mind. \\nIt shouldn’t come as a surprise that such discoveries are always made when studying the genome of remote populations. Over time, these isolated groups had little contact with the outside world. They lived and procreated within closed communities and this is reflected in their genome. The richer and more diverse your ancestry is, the less likely it is for particular genes to remain unchanged. In the case of aboriginal Australians and Melanesians, the isolation meant fewer genes were altered over the course of their existence. \\nIt’s not hard to picture this alternative version of our past. The Anunnaki come to Earth, play god and engineer mankind. The chief scientist Enqi and the medical chief Ninti use genetic manipulation and in-vitro fertilization in order to create humans in their own image.They use mankind to serve their purposes and when it suits them, they dispense destruction in the form of a deluge of biblical(!) proportions. A few chosen humans are protected by a faction of the Anunnaki that decided to go against protocol. They survive and spread in all corners of the globe. Thousands of generations pass, and the genomes of those who ‘socialized’ the most become mingled beyond recognition. \\nBut in a few places, the flame of the creators still burns. '],\n",

       "  'Share on Twitter IJR Opinion is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. \\nYou ask, “Why Trump?” From your college classrooms, comfortable suburban homes and your summer lakeside retreats in quaint New England towns, you wonder why. \\nWhile in class the professor comments, “Well, the main supporters of Trump are uneducated white males.” You, a new age liberal sympathizer - and my classmate - blurt out, “Uneducated white males shouldn’t have the right to vote!” \\nIs this the college experience I signed up for? I know I\\'m the type of person liberals like you disdain; I\\'ve spent about half my years on this earth working blue collar jobs: logging, haying, septic work, farming, stacking stone walls. I\\'ve owned two 1940s era tractors. You don\\'t know what true labor is. I do - I was born and bred into this lifestyle. \\nAll over this land, alarms go off before the dawn. You may work from 9 to 5 in a cozy office, but for the working class the day stretches from dawn to dusk. Sometimes it takes two or more jobs to make ends meet. “Work hard and you will be rewarded,” says the world. But those with the most wealth have only found ways to make others work hard for them. \\nAlthough I have chosen to not cast my ballot for the Republican ticket this time around, I have empathy for those who will - those whom you, modern liberalism, created. You outsource businesses and you coddle illegal immigrants who drive down the cost of labor - and therefore the benefits of a job. You, the rich, liberal elite, have taken advantage of those whose backs you live upon. You gutted them, you skinned them, you left them to hang like a deer carcass to bleed out. \\nOn top of it all, you say people like me are “white trash,“”standard rednecks“ and “dirty hicks.” The champions of social justice that attend my liberal arts college in rural Vermont call us “dirty townies.\" \\nWe grow your food, we transport your food, we build your homes and we keep them maintained - and yet we are snubbed. We plow the roads, fix the power lines and drive semi-trucks so that you can live a life of convenience. You cut our wages and our hours - yet you say we don’t work hard enough. \\nSince I was 12, I have worked for both rich Republicans and rich Democrats. At least the rich Republicans don\\'t preach all that Democrats do to save the world - while paying me dirt. Few of those who support Hillary Clinton have had to awaken at 3:45 A.M. to start a chainsaw in the dim light of dawn, to work a job where either that chainsaw, a wood chipper, or a falling tree could kill them any day - for the reward of $12 an hour, no less. What is the working man’s death worth to those with millions? \\nYou distract us with the media and you harp on racism, sexism and the insignificant. Where in your agenda is there time for the growing class struggle, the death of family farming, and the tearing of the fabric of rural New England life? You swoop in from elsewhere to buy the land, gentrify the towns, and reduce the local population to the same status as the English peasant after the enclosure movement . \\nYou speak of social programs, give to those who do nothing, give every child a trophy and shelter them from the realities of the world. You talk of raising taxes that the rich somehow never pay. You would rather take a loaf of bread from the working stiff to support the unemployed or those who drink away a college education. \\nThe question at hand should not be, “Why Trump?” The question at hand should be why you drove those who support him into a hole and then tied their hands behind their backs. You want them to support the broken system that gave you, not them, the benefit. Soon, you won’t have to worry about them supporting Trump; rum-filled farmers, a rabble in arms... \\nThose whom you called a “ basket of deplorables ” are the same stock that brought America into being. Yet, raise taxes, you say. Raise the cost of living, of each and every good that is bought and sold. The resulting burden will only fall upon those who labor their lives away, to struggle to exist, who always will. '],\n",

       "  'Home This Month Popular The Path Men Took To Trump The Path Men Took To Trump \\nDaryush \"Roosh\" Valizadeh created ROK in October 2012. You can visit his blog at RooshV.com or follow him on Twitter and Facebook RSS November 20, 2016 Politics \\nEvery man who supports Donald Trump came to it from a different path. Some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants . Or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect. For me and many other men, we came to support Trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women . The fight began in 2012 with the Southern Poverty Law Center \\nIn March 2012, after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites , I was put on a list by the Jewish-operated Southern Poverty Law Center for being a misogynist . I was shaken up by this because I knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths I’ve learned from it put me on a path of no return. Either I close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door. \\nI decided to keep going. I responded to the SPLC designation with an article titled My Existence Is Becoming Illegal , where I described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it. \\nIt is clear that gender hate is now a one-way street. Men can hate women but not the other way around. Men can rape, women can’t. Men can be abusive, both physically and emotionally, but women can’t. Men can be misogynist, but women can’t be misandrist, a word that is unknown to most of the American population. Men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day, but women are perfect as-is in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful. Male teachers get sent to pound-me-in-the-ass prison if they have sex with a student, but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist. If you’re a man, you’re likely a perpetrator of hate, violence, and abuse to innocent American women, even if you don’t yet realize your thought crime, but never the other way around. \\nFast forward two years to October 2014. Witch hunts by leftists were in force. Rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists, homophobes, and sexists with the aim of getting them fired. I studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles I’ve ever published: What Is A Social Justice Warrior (SJW) ? \\nThe article was widely shared, influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia, the corporate news media, Hollywood, Fortune 500 companies, Silicon Valley, and the billionaire owners of our politicians. Scratch a feminist SJW and you’ll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes. \\nI was pessimistic when I wrote the SJW article, thinking we’d need a full generation (25+ years) to even begin defeating such a powerful anti-American entity . I focused on teaching men self-defense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them. Little did I know that I was defining them at their absolute peak, and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency. The social justice warriors haven’t gone away, and they are rushing to fulfill the will of George Soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election, but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced, along with the power of the institutions that support them. \\nThough SJWism peaked in 2014, I had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of 2015 during the Canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in February 2016 during the international meetups . I survived those attacks, and the fact that I’m still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platforms—while you’re still here participating—shows clearly how little power they really had to stop us. They bruised me during the meetup outrage, but I healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs, Donald Trump. Donald Trump ground zero \\nI’m a pessimist by nature, so I didn’t have much hope that the establishment would allow Trump to win in the primaries, even though I was confident his ideas resonated with most Americans. But then I noticed that he simply couldn’t be knocked out, no matter what his enemies did. I saw him humiliate Jeb Bush , out-compete a resurgent Ted Cruz, and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness. By the time I attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , I started to believe. \\nThe ground zero for Donald Trump within the manosphere was The Donald Trump thread on the forum, created in June 2015 by veteran member and ROK contributor Samseau . This is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men. Over 2,000 pages long, the thread has been viewed nearly 6 million times. Ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse, as described here , to men with bullhorns larger than I have. \\nAfter significant battles in a real war, medals are awarded but soldiers don’t nitpick on who was the “best” soldier. They all worked as a team to ensure victory, from the General (Donald Trump), the Colonels (his advisers), the Captains (major media influencers like Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Paul Joseph Watson, and Mike Cernovich), the Sergeants (men like myself), the Specialists (men like Samseau), and on down to the Private, a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time. \\nThe ego cares about how impactful one is, how influential its ideas are, but the team player only cares about victory for the whole. Whether I am a Private or a Sergeant, I fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourth-generational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future. Who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free open-source software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election, but on the lives of so many men who participated in it. Approaching the date of the election \\nTwo months before the election, I did a Youtube video urging men to vote for Trump , and it resulted in nearly 150 unsubscribes within a day, surprising even me since I thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a Trump presidency. The video echoed a lot of sentiments I shared in the article If Donald Trump Doesn’t Win, We’re Screwed , where I tried to convey the danger of a Hillary presidency. \\nObama was the “race” president, and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years. Hillary will be the “gender” president. The future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat Trump. \\nNot only will she move to establish a techno-matriarchy where men are second-class citizens to any female, but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again. This isn’t a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like Twitter or Youtube—many of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment. \\nFor the next month, I stared at the calendar, waiting for the election to happen, doing what I could to push back against the narrative on Twitter . Then in early October, an old tape was released of Trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they “let” him. My sister called me, confused, and asked if he really was a bad man. I told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a “ pro-rape advocate .” I told her not to believe the media and to judge Trump by his actions and his policies, not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help Hillary’s failing campaign. \\nI spoke to her with confidence, but inside I was concerned: in a politically correct world, would this be the blow to sink Trump’s candidacy? Is the majority of Americans actually ready to defeat political correctness? Thankfully, Trump responded strongly, ignoring calls by the traitors in the Republican party to step down. \\nThe first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that Trump’s support didn’t decline. The fake controversy didn’t work. I held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out, maybe of him saying the n-word, but none did, and I knew the establishment had no more bullets. This was the moment where I finally believed. I felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that Trump was going to win. I did a Periscope that night as if I was amped up on methamphetamine, but I took no drug. \\nFrom that point on it was just a matter of hanging on, until finally on November 8 when he was elected President. I was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when I was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against Trump. I didn’t have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom I consider on the same team as us. If I made any miscalculation, it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces. I underestimated our own power, and those of our allies in the alternative internet space. Human control is a foolhardy endeavor \\nThe most important lesson I learned from Trump’s victory is how pointless it is to control human beings, both their behaviors and their minds. Every single major institution in the United States, represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence, could not stop a populist candidate, in spite of trying everything short of assassination. \\nGeorge Soros and his billions weren’t effective. Obama and his allies weren’t effective. The mainstream media and their dozens of outlets weren’t effective. CEOs of the biggest companies in the United States weren’t effective. Hollywood and it’s superstars weren’t effective. Academia and it’s thousands of professors weren’t effective. Social media and its censorship efforts weren’t effective. The FBI allowing Hillary to skate from real crimes wasn’t effective. Even Donald Trump’s own party wasn’t effective in stopping him. It’s absolutely incredible that all these forces couldn’t stop one man and his believers. What a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably! \\nThink right now of how much effort the anti-Trump forces put into stopping him from winning. Think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome. And now think how it was all for nothing . They accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish, after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the American public. \\nWhatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existence—nature, God, Tao, or so on—it is clear that humans cannot control it all, and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing, that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn, and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it. Imagine how impotent George Soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing. \\nNow they have to perfect their control methods even more, open their pocket books further, and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full. Their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears, of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody, that they are powerful, that the world must be shaped into their image, that they are gods among men, but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money. Much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat, or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled. \\nYou can control human beings, but only temporarily and only some of them. At the end of the day, humans want to do what they want to do, and if you don’t possess what they wish to buy, they will go to someone who does, no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control. The more you control what does not want to be controlled, the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling, of which we are currently living through. In previous eras, that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets, but in our modern era, it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes. \\nIf you want to be a true leader of society, create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want, can freely engage in commerce, can create families, can live in safety, can search for the truth without interference, and can work and play and live according to their nature. Put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down. It may take a decade, it may take 100 years, but it will happen, and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness. Conclusion \\nWe are tired of being controlled. Leave us alone. We are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us, of forcing us to believe in falsehoods, of programming us to hate our country, of pitting woman against man and black against white. Leave us alone! Let men be men, and from that a new American renaissance will come forth. Men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives, and if you prevent us from doing so, we won’t allow you to live yours. We will humiliate your useful idiots, we will destroy your institutions, we will lash out with more than just memes. \\nI’m afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us, but at least now we have our man in the White House who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years. I can’t wait to see where this fight takes us next. Nov 20, 2016 Roosh Valizadeh '],\n",

(Photos by AFP) \\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has stressed that his country’s military is not a threat and would not be attacking anybody. \\n“Our Armed Forces are not threatening anybody…I would like to stress once again, to make sure everyone hears – not only people in this hall,” said Putin while giving a speech in Russia’s Yaroslavl on Saturday. \\nReferring to claims that Russia might attack other countries, especially its neighbors in the Baltics, Putin asked, “Why would we do this?” \\n“We have the biggest territory in the world, like I said, everyone knows it, and we need to provide effectively security for our own country, for our own people,” he added. \\nHe noted that Russia’s armed forces are perfectly capable of providing security, and that developing the forces will continue. He also hailed efforts made so far to make the military “efficient… modern and highly effective.” \\n“The number of military drills has increased multiple times, including snap checks, which for some reasons from time to time worry our counterparts, let’s call them as such for now,\" he added. \\nHe added that other countries\\' drills do not worry Russia. The Russian army must be “compact, but highly effective. Thus we shall continue the structural reform, and we shall keep optimizing the personnel, but without any mass cuts.\" Russian female cadets take part in the military parade at Red Square in Moscow on November 7, 2016. \\nPutin’s remarks come at a time that NATO aims to send “battle groups” to the Baltic states and Poland early next year. The groups will consist of 40,000 forces. It will be the biggest military buildup near Russia since the Second World War. More forces would also be deployed if necessary. \\nNATO suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014, after the then-Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula voted in a referendum to join Russian territory.

This is country music, and we have 50 years to cover. So I feel like we’ll have lots to talk about, but I think it will be more geared to just us and what we do and all these legends that we have and people that have incredible talent that we have in our genre.” \\nWhile we don't know if Paisley got Underwood's memo, we do know that he's already up to the duo's usual shenanigans .

By Boris Egorov , RIR Russia's Ministry of Defence \\nMilitary special operation forces are elite units of the Russian Armed Forces. They are controlled by the Main Intelligence Agency (GRU) under General Staff. \\nThe primary function of special forces in wartime is infiltration behind enemy lines, usually well before hostilities are scheduled to begin and, once in place, to commit acts of sabotage (such as the destruction of vital communications logistics centers, the command posts for the guidance of nuclear weapons ), the assassination of key government leaders and military officers. \\nActing in groups of five to ten people, the Spetsnaz GRU is able to act autonomously for several days. \\nSoldiers go through special physical and psychological training, in which special emphasis is placed on mastering the weapons, skill in radio communications, and knowledge of the enemy’s territory. \"],\n",

       "  'Photo by Swithun Crowe | CC BY 2.0 \\nThis fall, the U.S. agreed to provide $38 billion in military aid to Israel over the next ten years, ensuring America’s continued role in funding the occupation of Palestine. Meanwhile, my friends and colleagues here in Gaza live in fear of another significant Israeli attack in the near future. \\nThey have every reason to fear another major escalation — violence is a daily reality in Gaza. In two recent incidents, a rocket was fired from Gaza into Israel without causing damage or injuries, and in both instances Israel responded by bombing targets throughout Gaza. \\nIn August alone, Israel bombed more than 50 locations in the small territory . \\nThe simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction: Palestinians attacked Israel with a rocket and Israel responded. We hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort, but it’s woefully incomplete. \\nIn both instances, the rockets fired weren’t fired by Hamas, but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with Hamas, which governs Gaza. These groups seek to incite Israeli attacks on Hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over Gaza, because they see Hamas as too comfortable with the status quo. \\nSince seizing power in 2007, Hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory. Outside of periods of defined military escalation — which tend to be precipitated by Israeli attacks — they have effectively stopped attacks against Israel from Gaza. \\nThis explains why, as noted by the Israeli press, there were only 14 rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel between January and August this year. None were fired by Hamas, so Israel’s decision to target Hamas as a response makes no sense. \\nOf course, 14 rockets fired from Gaza is 14 too many for those of us committed to ending all violence, and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by Hamas. \\nBut, as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories reports , there were also 45 Israeli military incursions into Gaza this year, resulting in 7 Palestinian deaths and, on average, injuring five Palestinians in Gaza every week. \\nThis is the part of the story that isn’t told. \\nGaza also remains under an Israeli-imposed blockade that severely limits travel, trade, and life for Gazans. Despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the 2014 Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement, the blockade remains in effect. \\nIsrael, with support from the U.S. government, claims this decades-long blockade is in place to pressure the people of Gaza to rise up against Hamas and provide security for Israelis. \\nIf those are Israel’s raisons d’etre, then it’s a complete failure. It hasn’t stopped violence, it hasn’t weakened Hamas, and it hasn’t brought Israelis or Palestinians security. \\nWhile the blockade hasn’t succeeded in achieving the changes Israel claims to be seeking, its impact on the civilian population of Gaza has been immense. \\nOver two years after the end of the last large military operation there, much of Gaza remains in ruins. \\nOf the 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza who were displaced during the 2014 Israeli bombardment, over 65,000 remain homeless, as 70 percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed haven’t been rebuilt. This is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering Gaza. \\nThis important context is too often missing as U.S. pundits and politicians consider the situation in Gaza. \\nGiven the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by Israel, the firing of less than 2 rockets per month by Palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence. \\nIf the U.S. is serious about promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, preventing future violence in Gaza, and guaranteeing security, then it must recognize the violence inherent in the Israeli occupation and end the blockade. \\nThe next attack on Gaza, feared by my friends who live there, is an inevitable reality if nothing changes. \\nMike Merryman-Lotze has worked with the American Friends Service Committee as the Palestine-Israel Program Director since 2010. \\nDistributed by OtherWords.org.

       " [\"If anyone doubts Bernie Sanders would've crushed Trump, show them this\",\n",
       "  'Zach Cartwright | November 10, 2016 \\nAccording to the data, Donald Trump would have been soundly defeated by Bernie Sanders last night had the Vermont senator been the one to face him. \\nWhen examining the 13 states Hillary Clinton lost twice — the states Trump won side-by-side with the states Bernie Sanders won during the Democratic primary — the similarities are striking. The GOP nominee likely saw this, and tweeted in May that he was relieved to not have to face Sanders in the general election: I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! \\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2016 \\nIn five states Sanders won where exit polling data is available — Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wisconsin — the demographics that helped Trump hit 270 electoral college votes were also Sen. Sanders’ key demographics that helped him defeat the former Secretary of State in multiple primaries in different regions of the country. \\nThe numbers suggest that there may have been enough Sanders votes in those pivotal states to have swung the election in Sanders’ favor if superdelegates and restrictive closed primaries weren’t part of the Democratic primary process. Popular blog All That Is Interesting created an electoral map assuming that Sanders won white, rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that Hillary Clinton lost on Tuesday night in a hypothetical Trump/Sanders general election matchup, giving Sanders with a 303-235 advantage . \\nDetermining whether or not Sanders would have won the states Clinton lost is easy when looking at exit poll data taken during the Democratic primary. Here’s a state-by-state breakdown: Indiana \\nBernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by 5 points in Indiana’s May 3 primary. Tuesday night, Trump beat Clinton in the Hoosier State by 20 points . While Indiana went to Mitt Romney in 2012, it’s worth remembering that Barack Obama won the state in 2008, meaning it isn’t a solidly red state. \\nWhat contributed most to Sanders’ primary win in Indiana was his dominance with white voters (57 percent support) and men (59 percent support), who collectively made up 72 percent and 42 percent of voters, respectively, according to NBC News . Sanders also excelled among poor and lower-middle class voters, winning the majority of voters who made less than $30,000 in 2015, and between $30,000 and $50,000. Sen. Sanders won the support of a whopping 72 percent of independents, 54 percent of voters who said free trade had a negative effect on jobs, and 60 percent of voters who said they were “very worried” about the future of the U.S. economy. \\nComparatively, Donald Trump won 53 percent of white voters in the Hoosier State’s Republican primary, and 59 percent of men — roughly the same percentages Sanders won for those same demographics. Trump also won 54 percent of voters who made between $30,000 and $50,000 in 2015, and 53 percent of voters who were “very worried” about the future of the economy. Michigan \\nThe March 8 Michigan primary was perhaps Bernie Sanders’ most important victory, as pollsters widely and wrongly predicted a considerable victory for Hillary Clinton due to her strength with black voters in cities like Detroit and Flint. Sanders’ 50-48 win was largely due to his strength with rural, white voters disenfranchised by free trade deals backed by the Clintons, like NAFTA. \\nMuch like Indiana, Sanders prevailed with the help of 55 percent of male voters and 56 percent of white voters . 54 percent of voters who made less than $50,000 in 2015 supported Sanders, as well as 71 percent of voters identifying as independent. NAFTA hate brought Sen. Sanders over the finish line, as 56 percent of voters who said free trade was bad for job growth in Michigan picked Sanders. The Vermont senator did very well with voters who said they wanted an outsider in office, winning 84 percent of that demographic . Sanders’ strength wasn’t in inner cities, but in suburbs and rural areas, capturing 50 percent and 57 percent of voters, respectively. \\nDonald Trump beat all four of his competitors in the Michigan primary along the same demographic lines. Trump won 53 percent of men and 38 percent of white voters ( 13 points better than his closest competitor, Ted Cruz). Among the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, Trump demolished Cruz by 21 points. Trump also won 45 percent of voters who said free trade took away American jobs, which was 23 points higher than Cruz. West Virginia \\nVoters in West Virginia largely live in rural areas, work blue-collar jobs, and are some of the poorest in the country. It’s no surprise Sanders won by 15 points in the May 10 primary, and that Trump beat Ted Cruz by 68 points. Because Democrats are well-represented in the West Virginia legislature, and because West Virginians just elected a Democrat for governor while simultaneously rejecting Hillary Clinton, it’s very possible Sanders would have won the state had he been the Democratic nominee. \\nAs was the pattern during the Democratic primary, Sanders won with white voters and men , capturing 52 percent and 53 percent of those demographics, respectively. Sen. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton by 32 points in the $30,000 to $50,000 income demographic, and also beat the former Secretary of State by 19 points among voters who made less than $30,000 last year. Trump obliterated the competition in those same gender, race, and income demographics. Wisconsin \\nClinton’s loss to Trump in the Badger State was perhaps the most significant of the night, as Wisconsin hasn’t voted for a Republican for president in more than 30 years . Wisconsin was also a state where Sanders notched a crushing victory over Clinton, winning by a 57-43 margin . \\nBernie Sanders won nearly two-thirds of male voters, and 59 percent of whites, who made up 83 percent of the electorate in the state’s April 5 primary. Sen. Sanders defeated Clinton in all of the income demographics, but did particularly well among middle class voters, capturing 54 percent of the $30,000 to $50,000 demographic, along with 61 percent of the state’s $50,000 to $99,000 demographic, who made up the largest percentage of primary voters. Among voters against free trade policies, Sanders won by a 60-39 margin . \\nWisconsin exit pollsters also asked voters about their opinions on foreign policy. While Trump made a reputation for himself as anti-interventionist, Sanders also appealed to Wisconsin voters opposed to foreign intervention. An astounding 74 percent of Sanders backers in the primary said the United States should take a “less active role” in foreign policy, who collectively made up 35 percent of the electorate. \\nWhile we can’t unfortunately travel back in time and give Bernie Sanders the nomination, one thing to take away from this data is that the tide is shifting in America toward a new form of politics that eschews global capitalism and yearns for economic populism. Whoever challenges Donald Trump in 2020 should pay close attention to these numbers. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

       " ['US Feigns Human Rights Concerns in Philippines | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Column: Politics Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is heading a controversial campaign against crime, embodied in his “war on drugs” which has led to violence spanning the nation’s troubled urban centers. President Duterte’s comments have ranged from reasonable, to utterly indifferent regarding fears of extrajudicial executions, vigilantism, and very real human rights abuses – opening a door of opportunity for his political opponents both at home and abroad. President Duterte’s inability to clearly condemn extrajudicial executions and vigilante violence, along with his inflammatory, provocative, even dangerously demagogic statements both invites further abuses, as well as both legitimate and opportunistic criticism of him, his administration, and his policies. While legitimate criticism is both necessary and justified, it is undermined by disingenuous political opportunism, wielded by hypocrites who only stand to compound the Philippines’ current crisis, not solve it. America the Humane? Among President Duterte’s more opportunistic political opponents is the United States. While the United States would otherwise be justified and morally grounded in its criticism of President Duterte’s administration, there are some current and past complications that reveal such criticism as stark hypocrisy, crass opportunism, and even the cynical political exploitation of abuse, rather than any genuine attempt to constructively address or stop it. The most recent manifestation of America’s feigned concern regarding the Philippines’ ongoing campaign against accused illicit narcotic dealers was the blocking of a shipment of US-made rifles destined for Philippine police units. Some 26,000 rifles were on order before being blocked by the US Senate based on “concerns about human rights violations.” These concerns, however, have not prevented the US from selling billions of dollars worth of weapons, including warplanes, munitions, tanks, and helicopters to Saudi Arabia, who is using this vast US-made arsenal to oppress its own people and execute a war of aggression against neighboring Yemen. Saudi Arabia is also admittedly involved in arming and funding terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq, including with US-made weapons – particularly anti-tank TOW missiles. This hypocrisy exposes US “concerns” as merely politically motivated, designed to put pressure on Manila in an effort to reassert US influence over the Southeast Asian state. Not only has the US previously enjoyed greater influence over the Philippines since the end of World War II, but before the war, and for half a century, the United States literally controlled the Philippines as a US territory. It seized the Philippines in a bloody 1899-1902 war that claimed the lives of over a quarter of a million people ( some sources estimate over half a million ), and initiated an occupation marked by brutality, oppression, and torture, including the introduction of water boarding (then called “water curing”) conducted by the US as a means of attitude adjustment for local Philippine leaders. It is ironic and telling that both water boarding and attempts by the US to maintain influence over the Philippines both persist to this day. Attempts by the US to predicate its desire to control Manila on “concerns about human rights violations” not only is bitterly ironic, it undermines those genuinely attempting to expose and stop real abuses taking place amid the Philippines’ current crisis. President Duterte has been able to insulate himself from criticism precisely because of US hypocrisy and meddling. Had independent, local activists and media platforms – networked with regional and international organizations – attempted to expose and rein in President Duterte’s anti-crime campaign, it would have been immeasurably more difficult to dismiss the facts and continue with impunity. The US has in essence discredited genuine human rights concerns by hijacking them for self-serving political objectives. Extrajudicial executions, vigilante violence, and President Duterte’s indifference, even defense of both, needs to be opposed – but by the people of the Philippines – not disingenuous, exploitative, and self-serving foreign interests who are not only notorious human rights abusers today – worldwide – but who have carried out campaigns of extermination, torture, and human rights abuses in the Philippines itself, as a foreign conqueror and occupier. For President Duterte, it is more than possible for him to lead a more dignified and just campaign against criminals operating across the Philippines. Nations like Singapore have used stern, popular, but legitimate judicial measures to rein in the drug trade and organized crime, so can the Philippines. Doing so would close this door of opportunity President Duterte himself opened to the Americans, and leaves open with his current policies.

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nMOSCOW, November 8. /TASS/. Witness in the case of Russian oppositionist Boris Nemtsov’s murder, former worker of a Moscow auto dealership Artyom Trapezin has identified one of the suspects and confirmed selling them a car used by the suspected killers to spy on the politician. \\nThe witness has made this statement at the Moscow District Military Court, which is holding a hearing on the Nemtsov murder case. \\nAccording to the witness, suspect Dadayev was going to buy a car with a copy of a passport allegedly for his brother who had had a car accident. \\n“I earlier saw and talked to Zaur Dadayev. We agreed with him on the price of the car and he drove off for getting money, after which he returned and bought a ZAZ Chance car for 90,000 rubles [$1,400],” Trapezin said. \\nHowever, Dadayev rejected this testimony. \\n“I saw him only in the investigator’s room for the first time. We don’t know each other,” he said. \\nNemtsov, former deputy prime minister under then-President Boris Yeltsin, co-chairman of the Parnas party and lawmaker of the Yaroslavl regional legislature, was gunned down in downtown Moscow on February 27, 2015. Five persons were arrested on March 8 last year on suspicion of murdering the politician: Zaur Dadayev, Anzor and Shadid Gubashev, Tamerlan Eskerkhanov and Khamzat Bakhayev. \\nDepending on their role and the degree of their involvement, they are pressed with charges under part 2, article 105 (“Contract Murder Committed by an Organized Group”) and part 3, article 222 of Russia’s Criminal Code (“Illegal Acquisition, Transfer, Storage, Transportation and Possession of Firearms and Ammunition by an Organized Group”). Article 105 carries a punishment of up to life imprisonment. \\nThe accused persons are denying their complicity in Nemtsov’s murder. The term of their arrest has been extended until December 30. \\nAccording to investigators, the men received at least 15 million rubles ($238,000 at the current exchange rate) for the politician’s murder. They started preparing for the killing back in September 2014. The suspected organizer of the murder is Ruslan Mukhudinov, a former officer of the Chechen “Sever” battalion. Mukhudinov has been charged in absentia. He has been on the international wanted list since November 2015. A criminal case against him and other unidentified persons is investigated separately. \\nIn late June, Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office sent the criminal case to the Moscow District Military Court to review its merits. The defendants have insisted that the murder case should be considered by the board of jurors. \\nThe case is heard by the Moscow District Military Court rather than the Moscow City Court as Zaur Dadayev, one of the suspected perpetrators, was a serviceman of the “Sever” battalion in the North Caucasus republic of Chechnya at the moment when the murder was committed. \\n{{item.group_date}} '],\n",

       " ['Trump and the Power of Money | The Vineyard of the Saker',\n",
       "  '1597 Views October 28, 2016 8 Comments Guest Posts The Saker \\nby Peter Koenig \\nImagine, Donald Trump would accede to the US Presidency, an unlikely event with the presstitute media relentlessly slamming, slashing and demonizing him, not unlike they do with President Putin – while cheering no-end for the warmonger Killary, no matter what atrocities she has on her hands and body, no matter that blood is dripping out of her mouth every time she opens it – like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan, Sudan – and more, much more. They, the elite, the military-security complex, the financial mafia, want more blood, more than is already covering the entire current Obama Administration’s structure of psychopaths. Blood is weapons, blood is money, blood is more profit, blood is good for business – so said the Washington Post, just slightly translated from ‘war is good for business’. The warmongering MSM (mainstream media) also propagate for more weapons to enrich the military-security complex that pays them. But just for a moment, let’s assume, Trump would get elected with such a large margin that voter fraud would be difficult to manage. \\nTrump is sending a different narrative from that of eternal war. Trump seems to be looking into a different direction. He essentially says – stop the conflict with Russia, make Russia a partner, stop outsourcing jobs, bring them back, give labor back to Americans, slash the unemployment rate – which is, of course, everybody knows, way above the silly fabricated 5%. The reality is that unreported but real unemployment in the US is hovering between 22% and 25%, a real hammer for the economy, increasing anger and unhappiness and crime. Trump also says in the same vein as bringing back jobs – STOP globalization, restrain NATO, rein in the banks – yes, Wall Street, the Goldman Sachs-es and Co. of this world of fake pyramid money, dominated by the Rothschild-Rockefeller-Morgan clan. Trump says, let’s have a financial system that works for the people. \\nDoes he mean it? – I don’t know. Could be true. Most of what he says makes sense for America, for Americans – and by extension for much of the rest of the world, especially Europe, the genuine Europe, not the puppet-commandeered Europe. He also says a lot of outright discriminatory and xenophobic rubbish – like building a wall separating Mexico from the US of A, emulating Israel; and propagates a crackdown on Moslems. Does he mean it? Or does he want to please potential voters? – Such statements are indeed dangerous rubbish, but they are secondary to all the other things that are PRIORITARY, as they would help restore American society, workforce, dignity – most important: DIGNITY. Dignity is important for Americans to wake up to realize that they are living in a country that wastes their money, the peoples’ resources – on countless criminal wars around the world, feverishly racing towards Full Spectrum Dominance to benefit a few. The secondary stuff is important too, but can be dealt with in parallel by Americans that have come to senses. \\nTrump is in many ways like France’s Marine LePen, representing the extreme right, and therefore, no matter what sensible things she says and has on her agenda to do – and I don’t doubt one minute that she means what she says – like EUREXIT and send NATO to hell – she is still framed by the ‘left intellectuals’ – if such a thing still exists in our neoliberal universe – as a discriminatory xenophobe who would expel all ‘colored’ and ‘veiled’ foreigners. Of course, that’s bad. But let her first initiating France exiting from the EU, the Euro and NATO – the likely salvation of Europe, then tackle the other issues. First comes first. A true intellectual left would have to understand that – and not bend to the presstitute promoted clichés. \\nTrump has enough money power. He doesn’t have to bend to the military security complex, to the banks, to the Obamacare pharma-fiefdom. He doesn’t really have to bend to anybody. That worries the elite. He is independent. Let’s give him the benefit of the doubt. In no case could he be worse than Hillary – the killer – so much can be read from every word she says. Her pattern of pathology – “We came, we saw, we won” , when she saw the bloodstained image of the NATO-slaughtered Ghaddafi – indicates that she would not stop from pressing this infamous Red Button of Death and total world annihilation – perhaps even repeating that same smirk, , “We came, we saw, we won” . \\nNow let’s go to the next hypothesis, assuming Trump would be elected and ‘they’ – the elusive high-powered small elite that pulls the strings on Washington and the White House’s overseas puppets, and let’s assume ‘they’ would let him live, at least for a while, Trump might be doing ‘irrational’ things in the eye of the Beltway slaves. Recognizing the perils for his own country and those for his neighbor, Canada, Mr. Trump might call on the western stooges, in Europe particularly, who for the sake of brown-nosing the naked king in Washington, are prepared to sell-out 500-plus million European and their future generations to the most nefarious trade deals the world has ever known – CETA, TTIP and TiSA (let alone the TPP, where 12 Pacific countries are about to kiss ass in Washington) – telling them to come to senses, think democracy and stop the deals that 80% or more of Europeans despise and reject. \\nAs a parenthesis and philosophically speaking, one could say that given the hundreds of years of colonization around the globe, of shameless exploitation, of raping and killing millions of people throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, that these trade ‘deals’ are Europe’s historically deserved heritage.—– The Saker wrote a great essay on the aberration of this upcoming election and what might follow after the election, “The US Is About To Face The Worst Crisis in Their History” – http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article45729.htm . One of the article’s commenters pinned it down to the point: “ If Trump does become Commander in Chief, his first job will be securing his life. Those who really run the show in the US will stop at nothing to safeguard their empire. Truly the US is at a cross roads and by extension the world. Times are really scary .” \\nWhat Trump says he would do during his first 100 days in office, he presented in a groundbreaking speech at Gettysburg, Pa. this past weekend, is for the most part truly astounding http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/24/donald-trump-delivers-a-powerful-policy-speech-on-his-first-100-days-in-office/ . It is not less than revolutionary, because no US politician, let alone a Presidential candidate or President has said something for the most part so sensible as did Presidential candidate Trump. Summarizing, he promises bringing back overseas jobs, would prevent the continued outsourcing of the American production processes, bring order to the crime-ridden communities, he would seek friendly partnership with Russia, defusing the WWIII threat – and he would tackle, restrain and control the corrupt banking system, including the endless money-making machine, the privately owned, Rothschild dominated FED. – That is a challenge other Presidents have failed to master, including Lincoln and JFK. We know how they ended. \\nTrump has already hinted that to revive the American economy the zero-interest policy may have to be changed, so that banks become more responsible. The owners off the system would hardly allow Trump’s interference in their obscene profit-making scheme. They’d rather at their calling let the bomb loose. A sudden change of this policy would hit many over-stretched banks like a bombshell – reminiscent of 2008 Lehman Brothers, just magnified by a factor of 10. There are currently at least three, possibly five Wall Street giants that are on the edge. They get by, because of the FED’s zero interest policy- and they make sure that this doesn’t change, as several if not all of them are part of the private FED system. Would Trump dare touching this system? – It’s a deadly challenge. He knows it. \\nThis time there may be more at stake then just another banking collapse, a planned emulation of the 2007 / 2008 crisis, where Wall Street was copiously rewarded for its excesses by tax-money bail-outs. Be aware, this time it would not be tax-payer’s money that would rescue the Too-Big-To Fail (TBTF) banks, but it would be YOUR money, your deposits, your savings, your pension funds, possibly even your shares if you have any in the bank being ‘collapsed’ – and the process would be called ‘bail-ins’. \\nThe (western) world is under the hegemon of a privately-owned money system, the US-dollar – and most people don’t even know it. The accent is on the western world , because the east, comprising Russia, China, the SCO countries (Shanghai Cooperation Organization – comprising China and Russia and most of the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, plus Iran and Pakistan – and others are waiting in the wings), the EEU (Eurasian Economic Union), as well as most of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), are forming their own eastern economic and monetary block. – I have said this before, but will repeat it for readers to realize – this ‘economic block’ – is largely, if not entirely, delinked from the dollar scheme. It consists of about half the world’s population and one third of the world’s GDP, a solid GDP that is. In contrast to the western, especially the US GDP; in the eastern block much of the GDP is based on real labor output and manufacturing. \\nIn reality, this eastern economic power block which is also displaying the world’s largest economic development potential, since history remembers, the New Silk Road – or the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) economic development scheme, stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon (if Europe chooses to participate), does not need the west anymore. The OBOR project has already begun. It represents a view into the future, with job opportunities and the outlook for a truly better life for hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people during coming generations – a dynamic vision for the future. The east is where the future lays.——- \\nDonald Trump as President notwithstanding, a new western well-planned banking collapse may start in the US, the ramifications and impact would be felt around the globe – sinking millions, hundreds of millions of people into poverty, misery, the like we haven’t seen in recent history. The banks ‘depositors’ money might not be enough. The reptiles are hungry. They might privatize public properties, infrastructures, roads, ports railways, health care, education, pensions, natural resources – anything that is still in the hands of the people. If Greece is a reminder, then think of Greece blown up by a factor of 1000 – all around the globe, touching in extremis the vulnerable people of the vulnerable countries – billions of people. While the money flows again from the poor to the rich, to an ever-shrinking pool of super-rich; widening the rich-poor gap to a disgusting yawn. Leaving the 99.99 % – by now the 99. % ever more powerless, having to fend for sheer survival – seeking refuge in ‘better lands’ – It’s a war by money. Canons, bombs and guns could rest – for a while. \\nFor years, I have felt the Empire will have to be brought down from inside – from the people who can’t take it anymore, from an internal revolt that eventually would break the worldwide extended monster’s back. Rome and most subsequent empires have fallen this way. It may still happen. But now I side more with The Saker’s theory, namely that the defeat may come from a combination of inside revolt and outside forces, not so much military forces, but economic forces. In theory, it could happen tomorrow. Just imagine, the one third of world-GDP-countries would drop all their dollar reserves, all the dollar denominated international contracts, all dollar issued trade agreements – and in particular, abandon at once the unwritten rule of hydrocarbons to be traded only in US-dollars. It would most likely wipe out the western economy. \\nThis will not happen, of course. Simply, because the One Third GDP holders do not want to destroy the economy of the rest of the world, especially the so-called developing and emerging countries, many – or most of them – eventually to become allies of this eastern block that promises peaceful co-existence rather than the current western pattern of ever multiplying wars and conflicts – a sheer dollar-fed killing spree, with destruction and weapons manufacturing no end. \\nThe Power of Money. Would Donald Trump, as President, himself a moneyed powerhouse, survive such a calamity? In fact, would he be able and strong enough to veer the ship around, guiding the world away from such destructive scenarios and towards peace and cooperation between East and West? – Or is the train already too far out of the station? – No telling at this time. The signals are certainly not good. But, let’s put in a grain of optimism and ‘bank’ on a positive strand of dynamics fueled by an increasing human consciousness – one that would not allow Hillary to push the Death Button. \\nPeter Koenig is an economist and geopolitical analyst.

Former Officer Brandon Matthew Sontag faces up to 18 months in jail and a $2,000 fine for both the petty theft and vandalism charges if he is found guilty. \\nPappas also noted the fight continues to have thousands in stolen cash and items returned to the rightful owners, as does his pursuance of a second lawsuit for an unspecified monetary amount in damages in the Orange County Superior Court. \\nAlthough the meager settlement is somewhat a victory for the victims — one of whom was a neighboring physician whose office had power and water cut during the incident — video evidences an armed and violent raid undertaken by cruel cops who appear as if they’ve discovered an enjoyable new sport. \\nIndeed if justice were truly to be served, all of the officers involved would be locked behind bars for performing a violent raid on a store providing a service to consenting customers on a voluntary basis.

       "  'Meet All The Pundits Pandering For A Trump Adminstration Job By: Aaron Bandler November 22, 2016 \\nWith Donald Trump set to take office in a couple of months, a number of his lackeys have reportedly been in talks about possibly serving in the administration. As of this writing, there are three pro-Trump pundits that might be in the Trump administration. \\nEric Bolling. Politico reported that Bolling was seen at Trump Tower and was reportedly discussed for a position in the Department of Commerce. What exactly that position that will be is not clear. Bolling told Politico that he \"can\\'t confirm anything.\" \\nGeraldo Rivera flat-out asked Bolling on The Five if he had been offered a job, and Bolling gave a non-answer . \\nBolling has been with Fox News since 2008, where he is the co-host of The Five and hosts the weekend show Cashin\\' In . Before then, he had been an analyst on CNBC and a New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) trader. Bolling has been an ardent supporter of Trump from the get-go, to the point where he resorted to some loony ideas . \\nLaura Ingraham. According to CNN Money , Ingraham is being heavily considered for President Trump\\'s press secretary. Here is what Ingraham has said on the matter: \\n\"I am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs. So we\\'ll see what happens,\" Ingraham said on Fox News. \\nShe cautioned: \"I think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative.\" But she strongly suggested that some sort of Trump administration post is in the works. \\n\"It\\'s a big decision, but I\\'m at the point where, if my country needs me, and if I can do something to actually, you know, advance the Trump agenda, which is stuff I have written about now for 15 years, with trade, immigration and just renewing America, then I obviously have to seriously consider that,\" she told Fox\\'s Tucker Carlson. \\nLike Bolling, Ingraham, who has been a nationally syndicated radio host since 2001 , has also been an early supporter of Trump, going as far as saying that #NeverTrump conservatives support partial birth abortion, and her website, LifeZette, attacked conservatives like Ben Shapiro for opposing the Alt-Right. (As usual, Shapiro punched back hard .) \\nJeanine Pirro. Pirro, accompanied by Rudy Giuliani, was seen headed inside Trump Tower, which has led to speculation that she is being considered for a job in the Trump administration, according to Page Six . What that job would be is not known. \\nPirro also has been an early Trump supporter, and she has claimed to have known him for 30 years . Pirro\\'s ex-husband, Al Pirro, has been described as \"a man Donald Trump keeps on retainer\" as a real-estate lawyer, and Trump once donated $20,000 to Pirro when she ran for New York state attorney general. \\nPirro has been with Fox News since 2006 and hosts Justice with Judge Jeanine on Saturdays. She also has an extensive legal career as a prosecutor in the state of New York and initially challenged Hillary Clinton when she ran for re-election in the Senate before dropping out to run for state attorney general.

       "  'BREAKING : Watchdog Group Says Virginia is Prepping to For Mass Voter Fraud BREAKING : Watchdog Group Says Virginia is Prepping to For Mass Voter Fraud Breaking News By Amy Moreno November 2, 2016 \\nThe Democrats will not give up without a fight. \\nAnd the only way they fight is “DIRTY.” \\nVirginia has printed 1 million provisional ballots, an unprecedented number that could allow a large number of previously disqualified felons to cast ballots for president in the potentially crucial swing state. \\nFrom Lifezette: \\nGeorge, a conservative election watchdog, charged on Monday that the Virginia Department of Elections is overpreparing for worst-case scenarios and increasing the likelihood of illegal votes being cast. In reply to Republican complaints earlier this month, Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortés acknowledged officials are preparing for all contingencies, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. \\nBut George said the provisional ballot printing doesn’t make sense even for contingencies. And it doesn’t compare to demand in 2012. \\n“The claim that it is for contingency planning is bogus,” George said in an email. “In 2012, Stafford County used less [sic] than 500 provisional ballots — in 2016 they received 30,000. In 2012, Loudoun County used 700 provisional ballots. In 2016, they received 84,000. In 2012, Fairfax used 2,500 provisional ballots; in 2016, they received over 265,000. This is ridiculous.” \\nBut spokeswoman Dena Potter of the Virginia Department of Elections said the state is trying to accommodate a court order. \\n“As part of its emergency preparedness efforts and in response to the [December] 2015 consent decree related to mitigating long lines at the polls, the Department issued guidance to local registrars on August 29, 2016, that included having enough provisional ballot envelopes to equal at least 20 percent of the number of active voters as of September 1,” Potter said in an email. “As of September 30, there were 5.5 million voters registered in Virginia. As with any contingency planning, we hope that we don’t have to use these but they will be available in case we do.” \\nThe decision to print so many provisional ballots comes after an April announcement by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and a key ally of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. McAuliffe said he would allow more than 200,000 released felons to vote on Nov. 8. \\nThe decision immediately brought a legal challenge from the Republicans, who won their suit in July. Virginia law says the governor must individually clear such cases, and cannot widely add so many released felons back to the voter rolls. \\nGeorge believes the court loss is part of the thinking behind the surge in provisional ballots. The thousands of felons who signed up to vote after McAuliffe’s order were initially welcomed to the voter rolls. George said left-wing voter groups were ready for the order, and signed up thousands of felons within hours. \\nIf those felons now walk into a polling place and demand a ballot, they will be accommodated, George charged. George also said he is concerned other ineligible voters will be handed such provisional ballots simply if they demand them. \\nProvisional ballots are only counted by city and county election boards after Nov. 8, and Republicans should be prepared for things to go against them, George said. Each board has a Republican and a Democrat, and a McAuliffe appointee. \\n“Guess which way the vote is going to go,” said George. \\nVirginia leaders have been dealing with election headaches for months. On Oct. 13, Virginia legislators questioned Cortés at a hearing. One Republican leader, citing election problems, called for Cortés to resign, according to the Times-Dispatch. \\n“I think it’s incumbent upon the governor to replace you quickly with competent and nonpartisan leadership,” said Delegate Timothy Hugo (R-Fairfax).

       " [\"5 Things You Need to Know About 'Sanctuary Cities' | Daily Wire\",\n",
       "  '5 Things You Need to Know About \\'Sanctuary Cities\\' By: Aaron Bandler November 16, 2016 \\nWith Donald Trump elected to the presidency, one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities, cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens. The issue became front-and-center during the early portion of the Republican primary when Trump decried the murder of Kate Steinle by an illegal alien in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. \\nIn response to the election of Trump, leftist city leaders are digging in, officials in Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal government\\'s deportation efforts. Here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities. \\n1. Sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law. Some on the left have tried to claim that they\\'re perfectly legal, but this is clearly false. As James Walsh , former associate general counsel of Immigration and Naturalization Services, explains, 8 USC section 1324 \"deals with those persons who knowingly conceal, harbor, or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states.\" \\nThe fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means they\\'re supporting a form of nullification, an irony not missed by Victor Davis Hanson : \\nMuch of the rural West opposes the Endangered Species Act. Can Wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders, when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways? Many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales. Could Oklahoma City declare hand-gun purchases within its city-limits free of federal firearms statutes? Perhaps Little Rock could ignore a Supreme Court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction. On what rationale would liberals in California object to such nullifications -- that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials? \\nTrump and the GOP can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law. \\n2. Sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement. Not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals, sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job. Some police officers in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) expressed their frustration with the city\\'s sanctuary city policy to Heather Mac Donald in 2004: \\n“We can’t even talk about it,” says a frustrated LAPD captain. “People are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics.” Another LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic, gang-infested district sighs: “I would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about [enforcing the immigration law against illegals].” \\nIn that 2004 piece, Mac Donald documents how members of the LAPD were able to recognize known gang members, but couldn\\'t do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime – despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country. This is the case with other sanctuary cities as well. \\n3. Sanctuary cities are \"akin to roulette.\" \"The odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ICE for deportation,\" writes Hanson. \"On the chance that some of their 10,000 released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of Juan Lopez-Sanchez, officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down, or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens.\" \\nBut the odds don\\'t suggest this. Hanson notes that according to Mac Donald, \"Two-thirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of Los Angeles involved illegal aliens -- as well as 95% of outstanding murder warrants.\" \\nAdditionally, Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies found that in a nine-month timeframe in 2014, sanctuary cities shielded 9,265 illegals from deportation, 62 percent of which \"had significant prior criminal histories\" and 2,320 of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes, according to Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review. \\n\"There is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught,\" writes Horowitz. \"This is just a nine-month snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies. As of last year, 69% of them were still at large. So much for not being a flight risk.\" \\nAccording to Vaughn , from January 2014 to September 30, 2015, sanctuary cities rebuked over 17,000 detainers, 68 percent of which involved \"individuals with a prior criminal history.\" \\nBased on these statistics, it would seem that the odds are against the cities\\' residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens, which makes it no surprise that... \\n4. Crime has surged in sanctuary cities. The Daily Wire \\'s Hank Berrien reported on the following from Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry: \\nAccording to Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, crime has risen in \"sanctuary cities\" across the nation. \\nLandry told the House Judiciary Committee\\'s Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, that sanctuary city policies \"allow illegals to commit crimes, then roam free in our communities.\" Landry’s appearance was prompted by the changed status of New Orleans, where city police are now banned from asking an individual\\'s immigration status. \\nUsing recent statistics from Los Angeles, another sanctuary city, Landry asserted, “Los Angeles saw all crime rise in 2015: violent crime up 19.9 percent, homicides up 10.2 percent, shooting victims up 12.6 percent, rapes up 8.6 percent, robberies up 12.3 percent, and aggravated assault up 27.5 percent … (sanctuary cities) encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base.\" \\nThis would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime . \\n5. There are an estimated 300 sanctuary cities, counties, and states, according to Vaughn. The full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here . Do you live in a sanctuary city? '],\n",

       "  \"Videos Protesters Disrupt “Affirmative Action Bake Sale” At UT-Austin The bake sale hosted by the Young Conservatives of Texas — in which prices varied depending on the buyer's race and gender — was meant to protest the consideration of race in admissions. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! The Young Conservatives of Texas at UT Austin held a bake sale at the West Mall to discuss affirmative action policies on Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016. The Young Conservatives were met with criticism, which resulted in a protest and several intense conversations among students. (Photo: Shelby Knowles/Texas Tribune/cc) \\nA controversial bake sale meant to protest race-based admissions at the University of Texas at Austin drew its own opponents on Wednesday. \\nThe campus branch of the Young Conservatives of Texas hosted the bake sale — in which prices varied depending on the buyer’s race and gender — to draw attention to affirmative action, which the event’s organizers said “demeans minorities on our campus by placing labels of race and gender on their accomplishments.” A cookie cost $1.50 for Asian males, 75 cents for white females and 25 cents for Hispanic females. \\nMore than 100 of their classmates showed up to host a counter-protest, calling the bake sale an offensive and inappropriate stunt. \\n“The labeling of races and the different prices of each is unacceptable…” said Jarvis Dillard, a UT freshman and one of the students protesting the bake sale. “White males have privilege above all the other races.” \\nIn a statement Wednesday, Greg Vincent, the university’s vice president for diversity and community engagement, called the event “inflammatory and demeaning.” \\n“Focusing our attention on the provocative nature of the YCT’s actions ignores a much more important issue: They create an environment of exclusion and disrespect among our students, faculty and staff,” the statement says. \\nThe young conservatives group held a similar bake sale in 2013 and was similarly chastised by Vincent, who called that event “deplorable.” \\nUT-Austin’s affirmative action policies have put the university in the spotlight over the past few years. In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the university’s affirmative action system in a 4-3 vote after it was challenged by a white woman, Abigail Fisher, who was denied admission. Fisher argued she was passed over by UT while less qualified minority students were not. \\nThe university considered the Supreme Court decision — which gives a small boost in admission to black and Hispanic students — a win. As of 2015, however, black students only made up 3.9 percent of the student population. During the protest, UT student body president Kevin Helgren said the campus has a long way to go in terms of inclusivity and diversity. \\n“Institutionalized racism exists and affirmative action helps to combat that,” Helgren said during the protest. “The act of putting financial values on groups of people based on their gender or on their race, in my opinion, is a really prominent way to engage in racism in 2016.” \\nOn the young conservatives’ Facebook event page, the group wrote: “YCT is a truly colorblind organization and believes that all government institutions are constitutionally prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race in all circumstances, including affirmative action.” \\nChristopher Shafik, a 19-year-old member of the young conservatives group, said “people assume that because we are in a position against affirmative action that we’re racist.” He said the opposite is true, and that the organization must work to change its image on campus.

       " ['Nuclear Weapons in South Korea under Discussion | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: South Korea In October 2016, the Presidential Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification of Korea suggested to the President of the Republic of Korea returning US tactical nuclear weapons to the country. The report entitled “The policy of promotion of the second plan on Korean reunification” states that the search for opportunities to place US tactical nuclear weapons in the Republic of Korea and the permanent basing of American strategic forces may serve as a pressure tool both on the DPRK, and on China to toughen sanctions in respect of Pyongyang. The placement of US tactical nuclear weapons in the Republic of Korea is justified in the report by the following example – SS-series ballistic missiles were placed in the territory of the former USSR that were targeted on Europe, in response to this, the USA placed Pershing II – the American medium-range ballistic missiles of mobile basing – in Europe. Earlier, on September 12, 2016, 31 representatives of the Saenuri governing party signed a statement, which proposed that the Parliament discuss launching an independent South Korean nuclear program. The same former leader of the parliamentary group Won Yoo-chul, who is one of the major proponents of the idea to publicly discuss the issue of nuclear weapons in the South, has announced that the Republic of Korea should consider any protection measures from the provocative acts of the North, including nuclear weapons for the purposes of self-defense. Won Yoo-chul believes that American strategic nuclear weapons should be placed in the South in the short-term in order to achieve nuclear balance with the North. However, in the long-term, the South should create its own nuclear potential exceeding that of North Korea at least two times. According to Chung Mong-joon, member of South Korea’s Parliament, as the Rubicon in terms of the peninsula denuclearization has been crossed, the Republic of Korea needs the nuclear weapons. The statement also emphasizes the fact that this is not an opinion of just a few members of Parliament. The day before, on September 11, the leader of the Saenuri governing party Lee Jung-hyun announced to journalists that the adoption of strict measures was required. He said that “in the current situation this is the topic of discussion to focus on; yet it is the issue that has been always avoided.” It goes without saying that the opposition called such a proposal unrealistic and potentially leading to increased conflict. The speaker of the Democratic Party of Korea Yoon Kwang-suk has called the proposal unspeakable. The Republic of Korea government also opposes the placement of the nuclear weapons in the country as it contradicts the denuclearization principle on the Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, one of the three leading conservative publications, surveyed 16 experts on security and international relations. They are divided into three groups: nine of them support denuclearization, four of them approve of the idea of obtaining the nuclear weapons for the purposes of self-defense or the placement of US tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea, and the remaining three experts propose using nuclear weapons against the North. Moreover, this division clearly correlates with their liberal or conservative outlook. Academics have noted that the South Korean bomb will go against the non-proliferation system, which may lead to a split in the international community. The Republic of Korea will have to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which will result in international sanctions and the termination of the Cooperation Agreement with the USA on nuclear power engineering. Thus, Seoul will lose access to enriched uranium, which will lead to disruption in the energy sector. In addition, it will send the wrong signal to the DPRK that nuclear weapons might be accepted by the international community. The nuclear armament of Seoul will mean a recognition of Pyongyang’s nuclear status and it will completely bury the prospects for the peninsula’s denuclearization. That is why some experts have proposed relying on the US nuclear “umbrella”, stating that Washington is unlikely to allow Seoul to obtain its own nuclear weapons, and any countermeasures may affect the country’s economic situation. Another position suggests using the nuclear program as part of a bargaining strategy in order to reach the “zero option” and to eliminate nuclear weapons in both the North and the South. Those who support the proposal of the Saenuri Deputies consider the independent nuclear program to be a well-minded response. The USA withdrew tactical nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula in 1991, and the majority of its nuclear torpedoes and mines were destroyed. It will be difficult to place American tactical nuclear weapons again. Moreover, “we should not entrust the destiny of our nation in foreign hands.” Is there any guarantee that the USA will join the nuclear war for our sake in the changing international environment? What is the public opinion on this issue? An opinion poll conducted by the Gallup Korea agency among 1,010 people showed that 58% of the respondents supported the idea of South Korea obtaining its own nuclear weapons. 34% of the respondents spoke out against it: most of them young people. The remaining 7% refused to answer or said they could not give a definite answer. Relying on the containment model that currently exists between India and Pakistan, supporters of the Seoul bomb suppose that the current technological level will mean a bomb can be made in 8-12 months . However, according to a statement made by an official of the US National Security Council Jon Wolfsthal on September 21, 2016, neither the independent program nor the placement of the US tactical nuclear weapons would boost the security of the Republic of Korea . The USA is able to attack its enemies from any part of the world, and all its potential opponents are aware of this. Therefore, he does not believe that these actions will play an additional role in dissuading the DPRK from turning to a military solution. Neither the USA nor the Republic of Korea is interested in the South Korean nuclear program. In the author’s opinion, the entire fact of bringing this issue for the public discussion is indicative, as South Korean nuclear weapons would truly cause great harm to the non-proliferation system.

       " ['Biden Blames “Lazy American Women” For The Economy: “They Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work” | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'Email Print Democratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. “If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,” he said. “That’s trillions of dollars over the next decade.” Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. “The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,” he argued. “We’re still battling recession, I don’t care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we’re not doing anything about it.” He added that it was “lazy American women” who brought about the downfall of the economy, because “they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.” “I’m not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we’re here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,” he said. “Mark my words and mark them well,” he addressed the crowd. “Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she’s a woman herself and not just any woman; she’s a self-made woman. So you better believe what she’s saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.” “Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She’s been all that and she’s learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,” Biden continued. “Today’s women are pampered and aren’t used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,” the vice president said. “They’re too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they’ve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.” “Now, that’s all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it’s the economy that’s missing out on valuable workforce. And that’s why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,” Biden concluded. Join us on Facebook to Stop The Takeover. Click on the button to subscribe. '],\n",

       "  ' Russophobia: War Party Propaganda\\nThe world\\x92s most reactionary regime, the head-chopping, terror-sponsoring Saudi Arabian kleptocracy, was awarded the chair of the UN Human Rights Council, while Russia has been kicked out. The travesty was engineered by the Superpower of Lies to punish Moscow for resisting the U.S.-led war of sectarian massacre and regime change in Syria. The War Party is on the march, to the cheers of corporate media \\x96 and Hillary hasn\\x92t even been elected yet.\\nBy Margaret Kimberley \\x93All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people.\\x94\\nNovember 06, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" BAR \" - Did Russia invade Iraq and kill one million people? Does Russia have a greater percentage of its population behind bars than any other country in the world? Did Russia occupy Haiti after kidnapping its president? Are Russian police allowed to shoot children to death without fear of repercussion? Is Russia entering its 20th year of a terror war against the people of Somalia? All of these crimes take place in or at the direction of the United States. Yet the full force of propaganda and influence on world opinion is directed against Russia, which whatever its shortcomings cannot hold a candle to America in violating human rights.\\nThe dangers presented by a Hillary Clinton presidency cannot be overstated. She and the war party have been steadily working towards a goal that defies logic and risks all life on earth. Regime change is once again their modus operandi and they hope to make it a reality against Russia.\\nNearly every claim of Russian evil doing is a lie, a ruse meant to put Americans in a fighting mood and lose their fear of nuclear conflagration. It isn\\x92t clear if Clinton and the rest of the would-be warriors actually realize they are risking mushroom clouds. Perhaps they believe that Vladimir Putin will be easily pushed around when all evidence points to the contrary.\\nThe unproven allegations of interference in the presidential election and casting blame on Russia as the sole cause of suffering in Syria are meant to desensitize the public. It is an age old ploy which makes war not just acceptable but deemed a necessity. The usual suspects are helping out eagerly. The corporate media, led by newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post , are front and center in pushing tales of Russian villainy. Human Rights Watch and other organizations who care nothing about abuses committed by the United States and its allies are also playing their usual role of choosing the next regime change victim.\\nRussia lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council in part because of American pressure and public relations assistance from the human rights industrial complex. The UNHRC is now chaired by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy that funds the jihadist terrorist groups who caused 500,000 Syrian deaths. The Saudis are causing dislocation, death and starvation in Yemen, too, but they are American allies, so there is little opposition to their misdeeds.\\nThe openly bigoted Donald Trump has been the perfect foil for Hillary Clinton. That is why she and the rest of the Democratic Party leadership preferred him as their rival. He made the case for the discredited lesser evilism argument and his sensible statements about avoiding enmity with Russia made him even more useful.\\nThe United States and its allies are the cause of Syria\\x92s destruction. Their effort to overthrow president Assad created a humanitarian disaster complete with ISIS and al Nusra fighters who love to chop off heads for entertainment. Far from being the cause of the catastrophe Russia left its ally to fight alone for four years. They even made overtures to negotiate Assad\\x92s fate with the United States. All attempts to stop the fighting were rejected by the U.S. and NATO and sealed the fate of the Syrian people. The people of east Aleppo are being shelled by American allies but one wouldn\\x92t know that by reading what passes for journalism in newspapers and on television. The American role in the slaughter is barely mentioned or is excused as an effort to protect the civilian population. The bloodshed was made in the U.S. and could end if this government wanted it to.\\nThe anti-Russian propaganda effort has worked to perfection. NATO is massing troops on Russia\\x92s borders in a clear provocation yet Putin is labeled the bad guy. He is said to be menacing the countries that join in threatening his nation. The United States makes phony claims of Russian war crimes despite having blood on its hands. The latest Human Rights Watch canards about prosecuting Assad come straight from the White House and State Department and have nothing to do with concern for Syrians living in their fifth year of hell.\\nThere is no lesser evil between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. She is fully supported by the war party in her desire for a more \\x93muscular\\x94 foreign policy. That bizarre term means death and starvation for millions more people if Clinton wins in a landslide. She must be denied a victory of that magnitude and any opportunity to claim a mandate. Peace loving people must give their votes to the Green Party ticket of Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. They are alone in rejecting the premise of an imperialist country and its endless wars.\\nThe United States is the most dangerous country in the world. If it has a reckless and war loving president the threat becomes existential. That is the prospect we face with a Hillary Clinton presidency.

       " ['Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency… Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  'Email Print Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. It’s also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. Ford’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. “Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.” The move comes at a delicate time for Ford. The United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. The union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn’t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It’s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. “We’re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven’t decided what will go there,” said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he’s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. “How does that help us?” Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. “Mexico is becoming the new China.” \\nIf you haven’t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so.

Done. Buried. Exposed. Over. Out. And using a slow-acting poison called hubris, it was death by suicide. So smug. So sure of themselves. So sanctimonious. So snark-filled. So utterly incapable of anything close to self-reflection. \\nThe self-induced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps. \\nHere they are. \\n1. Pimping for ObamaCare \\nThe national political media didn’t just cheerlead for ObamaCare, they LIED to us. Willfully and with malicious intent, they all lied to us. The outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill, right there in black and white. But the media didn\\'t care. They wanted to give their Precious Obama a win and in order to do that, they jumped on board the \"You Can Keep Your Insurance\" propaganda express. Worse, those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists, not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken fact-checkers. \\nThen Utopia met reality. \\nThen the lies were exposed. \\nAnd the result is that up to and including last night, at both the local and national level, ObamaCare has decimated the Democrat Party. But nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class. \\nThe media\\'s role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority. From here on, they could only get more sweaty, desperate, and dangerous. \\n2. Casting off Every Journalistic Ethic to Destroy Trump \\nOpenly, proudly, and belligerently, in order to hijack a presidential election, we were treated to the Pompous Announcement that Trump was such a threat to humanity, it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism, starting with objectivity. \\nEven former good guys like CNN\\'s Jake Tapper morphed into an unrecognizable LyingSnarkVirtueSignalingMachines -- another rotting cog in the Narrative Wheel, a mindless member of a self-deluded, government-worshiping cult that wouldn’t piss on Middle America if we were on fire. \\nProfessional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag, baby! And who could miss the historic opportunity to self-righteously point-and-laugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a Brave New World. \\n3. Grind Donald Trump To Dust \\nWhile there is no question Trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way, never in my 50 years have I seen such a coordinated, desperate, dishonest, and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity. \\n4. Embracing Confirmation Bias \\nThe longer the general election rolled on, the smaller the bubble of self-delusion became. \\nInconvenient polls were sneered at and Voxsplained away. \\nExit polls could only means ONE thing, even though it was pretty clear they might mean another. \\nMy personal favorite was the late editorials where, based on no counted votes whatsoever, we were trolled with the news that it was Hillary, not Trump, who would emerge victorious with the \"hidden vote!\" Oh, the delicious irony of that. Oh, how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes\\' faces on Election Night. \\nBy the time the votes were actually being counted, I was about 60% sure Hillary would win. The New York Times, however, was 92% sure. ABCNBCCBSAPBSNPRCNNWashingtonPostPolitico were 100% sure. \\nBut even I understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever, that Hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper Midwest, that the best pollster in the country had Trump up +2, that Trump never lost his fervent base, that the right track/wrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade, that there was still a larger-than-usual number of undecideds, that this thing that was Real might not be enough to win, but it was still Real. \\nNo, no, we were told, it\\'s all smoke and mirrors, all gold-leafed Trump Steaks. Look at Obama\\'s approval ratings! Look at the Hispanic vote! Look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there. Sit down, son, don’t you understand that I\\'m a data machine? It\\'s science, rube. Don\\'t you Vox, racist? \\nAnd then the worst thing imaginable happened…. \\n5. The Media Lost the Election \\nThe hate, the lies, the removal of the mask of objectivity, the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table -- that can actually work … IF YOU WIN. \\nBut the media didn’t win. \\nIn the most spectacular fashion, with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see, they lost. \\nAnd with that loss went EVERYTHING. \\nAnd now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a Swaggering Potemkin Bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion, even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man, and do so with much of the Republican Party on their side. \\nNot only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch, worse than all that, they are exposed as WEAK, a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again. \\nWithout that sheen of fear, without that threat of intimidation, like a vanquished bully, so goes all their power. \\nF*** you, mainstream media. \\n-- \\nThe delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious Barack Obama correct about one thing… \\nThe moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice. \\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC Tags '],\n",

       "  'Alternative News Thousands of Wild Bison Appear At Standing Rock Out Of Nowhere! A Sign From Mother Earth? \\nFor those of you who may not know, the largest Native American protest in HISTORY is happening right now . Over 500 Native American tribes from all over North, Central, and South America as well as Canada, all uniting under one cause: Protection of our water from greedy corporate interests. \\nIt certainly hasn’t been easy. Just this week alone hundreds of innocent people have been assaulted and arrested just for occupying the land the corporation behind the Dakota Access Pipeline stole using imminent domain. \\nIts been a major struggle for our water protectors. Not just because of the rampant violence they’ve had to face from police hired by the pipeline builders, but also because they are literally living in a camp set up in a field right now. Do you have any idea how cold it’s already getting there and it’s not even winter yet? TOO COLD. \\nThey’ve certainly been needing a pick-me-up.. And they just got one! (Video at the bottom of this article) \\nAccording to White Wolf Pack , a Native American website: \\n“The great bison or buffalo of North America is a very powerful symbol to American Indians. Though best suited to cooler climates, bison roamed virtually in entire continent. \\nThe smaller woodlands bison and its bigger cousin, the plains bison were revered and honored in ceremony and everyday life. To the plains Indian, our Bison Brother meant sacred life and the abundance of the Creator’s blessing on Mother Earth. \\nThe bison is powerful medicine that is a symbol of sacrifice and service to the community. The bison people agreed to give their lives so the American Indian could have food, shelter and clothing. \\nThe bison is also a symbol of gratitude and honor as it is happy to accept its meager existence as it stands proud against the winds of adversity. \\nThe bison represents abundance of the Creator’s bounty and respect for all creation knowing that all things are sacred.” The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe criticized law enforcement’s “militarized” response to the camp and called for demonstrations to remain peaceful, but stressed that activists would not give up their cause. \\n“Militarized law enforcement agencies moved in on water protectors with tanks and riot gear today. We continue to pray for peace,” Dave Archambault II said in a statement Thursday evening. \\n“We won’t step down from this fight,” he added. “As peoples of this earth, we all need water.

       " ['Under the Big Top – America’s Three Rings of Evil Clowns | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World As an American, someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail, I am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country’s government. The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama’s presidency we’ve witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama’s mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I’ll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack’s tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the “click” extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. “P.J.” Crowley made his “deal with the devil” from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; “Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?” Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley’s credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He’s now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he’s been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. “Fuck the EU”, along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton’s Secretary of State should he reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the “WOW” persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don’t take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the click that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November’s presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed her, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as “hash tag diplimacy.” Her “hot mic” comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being “ridiculous”, they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he’d “fix” the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he’s what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I’m a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby’s contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department’s stance on Russia’s hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won’t End Without Grounding Aircraft – this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington’s plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the “Kirbys” of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby’s “Russians in body bags” threat has pushed the Kremlin’s panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline “U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy”, it did not originate with them. Our new “probably” dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rotschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation’s capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie “The Turman Show” these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since me or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation, Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message – Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause – perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It’s really as simple as all that. Today’s Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone’s time. Once the “Man” has you, he’s got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn’t got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it’s easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary’s Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, naïve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The “Man” has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people’s fear they’ll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell’s 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn’t that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts. I don’t know how you feel about it, but I feel utterly betrayed.

Fox News Just Exposed Hillary ’s ILLEGAL VOTING Scheme To The Entire Country! \\nHillary Clinton has taken her illegal actions to a new level with a new move that involves enlisting the help of illegal immigrants to help her beat Donald Trump in November. \\nOnce again, Hillary is in violation of 8 U.S. Code § 1324, which makes it a felony to ‘conceal’ or ‘harbor’ any ‘alien’ ‘including any means of transportation.’ The penalty is five years in prison (ten years if it was done for “commercial advantage or private financial gain,” could be made for that). Hillary and the DNC also violated this law a few weeks back at the Democratic National Convention when they paraded two illegal immigrants across the stage to give an anti- Trump speech. \\nHillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented “Dreamers” into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump ’s immigration plans could result in their deportation – though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote. \\nClinton’s national voter registration program, called “Mi Sueño, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,” was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. \\nThe 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting.

       "  ' Truth Is The Enemy Of The State By Bob Livingston\\nNovember 10, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" Personal Liberty \" - There is a saw that comes from Shakespeare\\x92s \\x93The Merchant of Venice\\x94 that \\x93the truth will out.\\x94 But not if government has its way.\\nThat\\x92s because truth is the enemy of the state. The state, meaning the apparatus of government, is \\x93the system\\x94 that controls the American people.\\nMost people believe they control the political system through elections. Little do they know that the government and the corporate state own and control the state and the people. In other words, the system is rigged, as Donald Trump says . The system must keep this information invisible and it does so through constant conditioning of the public mind.\\nNow consider what has happened and is happening to Julian Assange. Consider Edward Snowden.\\nAssange created WikiLeaks in 2006, exposing, among other things, malfeasance in the conduct of Bush the Lesser\\x92s \\x93War on Terror.\\x94 Progressive Democrats loved Assange then.\\nBut by 2010, with George W. Bush out of power and Barack Obama continuing old wars and starting new ones, the truths that were being outed by WikiLeaks were hitting too close to home. WikiLeaks got its hands on a treasure trove of State Department and Pentagon emails and documents being dispatched across the globe.\\nI wrote at the time in \\x93 A war on the truth ,\\x94 that what WikiLeaks was revealing was:\\nthe result of a secretive, unaccountable and over-powerful government; a perfidious empire that seeks to rule the world by guile, cunning or force, if necessary. And the response by the United States government and by authorities in some of the U.S.\\x92s puppet states \\x97 like Great Britain, which arrested Assange, and Sweden, which brought spurious charges of rape against him \\x97 demonstrate the length the ruling elites will go to suppress the truth.\\nTruth is the enemy of a totalitarian regime. Fooling, lying, spying: That is the way of the totalitarian regime. Fooling, lying to and spying on friends and enemies, and even worse, its own citizens.\\nJust before I wrote that, we now know, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was contemplating various ways to shut WikiLeaks down. During a November meeting, sources say, Clinton suddenly blurted out, \\x93Can\\x92t we just drone this guy?\\x94\\nAccording to sources present at the meeting:\\nThe statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner, sources said. Clinton said Assange, after all, was a relatively soft target, \\x93walking around\\x94 freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States. Clinton was upset about Assange\\x92s previous 2010 records releases, divulging secret U.S. documents about the war in Afghanistan in July and the war in Iraq just a month earlier in October, sources said. At that time in 2010, Assange was relatively free and not living cloistered in in the embassy of Ecuador in London. Prior to 2010, Assange focused Wikileaks\\x92 efforts on countries outside the United States but now under Clinton and Obama, Assange was hammering America with an unparalleled third sweeping Wikileaks document dump in five months. Clinton was fuming, sources said, as each State Department cable dispatched during the Obama administration was signed by her.\\nClinton and other top administration officials knew the compromising materials warehoused in the CableGate stash would provide critics and foreign enemies with a treasure trove of counterintelligence. Bureaucratic fears about the CableGate release ultimately proved to be well founded by Clinton, her inner circle and her boss in the White House.\\nEfforts to shut down WikiLeaks included an American intelligence-initiated operation to entrap Assange in a phony rape charge. The U.S. government also pressured PayPal, VISA and MasterCard to shut down donations to WikiLeaks.

       " ['(video) Chris Wallace Drops BOMBSHELL On Hillary Campaign She Can’t Be President Because… – USA SUPREME',\n",
       "  '\\nAs USA Supreme first reported U.S. Code is clear Hillary is disqualified to be president! This news was just confirmed by Chris Wallace for Hillary there is no going back.The news that FBI Director James Comey has unilaterally decided to reopen the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server is unwelcome news in the Clinton camp. Not only does it give her opponent an incredibly potent talking point, it presents some legal problems for Clinton regardless of the election’s outcome. (you can view the full article below) Whatever emerges from the new emails could cross the line of “intent” that Comey said didn’t exist in July. And as Fox News’ Chris Wallace said to Brit Hume on On the Record on Friday, “We could end up with a president-elect who could, conceivably, be indicted after she becomes president.” Hillary Clinton has stated on many occasions that her candidacy is “historic.” While she’s only talking about her gender, it may be historic for more nefarious reasons. Never before has a candidate from a major political party run for the presidency while under criminal investigation. This is a fact that will go down in the history books alongside the fact that Clinton is the first woman to capture a major party’s nomination for President of the United States. \\nWallace just confirmed USA Supreme news that under U.S. Code Hillary is disqualified from running for president You can view the full article here http://www.usasupreme.com/confirmed-u-s-code-title-18-part-1-chapter-2071-hillary-officially-disqualified-run-president/ \\nPosted by USA Supreme on Sunday, October 30, 2016 Comey’s reopening of the investigation is based on information gleaned from the Anthony Weiner pedophilia investigation. Clinton uber-aide Huma Abedin is married to Weiner (not for long) and their shared computer likely led to the trove of 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton insisted she deleted. It should be noted here that Clinton deleted these emails after the entirety of her emails were requested under a subpoena. In fact, the only people who vetted the information in those 33,000 missing emails were Clinton’s personal lawyers, including Cheryl Mills. Mills received immunity from the FBI with assurances her computer would be permanently destroyed. Should Clinton be indicted, and should she be found guilty of the crime of mishandling classified information – among the other criminal acts she committed as Secretary of State along with her abuse of the Clinton Foundation – we would have a constitutional crisis. US law – 18 US Code § 2071 – states that a violator of this statute: “Shall Forfeit His Office And Be Disqualified From Holding Any Office Under The United States…Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.” This would necessarily mean that Clinton, if elected, would have to be impeached in the US House of Representatives, convicted in the US Senate, and then removed from office. That would add another first to Mrs. Clinton’s list of firsts. She would go down in history as one part of the married duo who were both impeached from the presidency. As Wallace said, “Just when you think it couldn’t get any more shocking, any more twisted…” Will Hillary break the law again and keep her security clearance we have to wait and see, but if there is any law in our country she would be disqualified to run for president!

       " ['BREAKING: Attempted Assassination of Donald Trump (VIDEO)',\n",
       "  'November 6, 2016 210 The attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a rally in Nevada has some eerie similarities to the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968. Share on Facebook \\n1968 was a grim year in American history. The Tet Offensive in Vietnam made many people who were never part of the anti-war movement, question why America had entered a deadly war of attrition. In April of that same year, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was shot dead. \\nInto this fray stepped Robert Kennedy, a man whose intelligence, charm, charisma and modern policies came close to putting ice over the fire that was late 1960s America. He consciously stood as an anti-war Democratic in a primary which pitted him against the party’s pro-war establishment led by Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson’s vice president. Although the lesser known Eugene McCarthy also stood as an anti-war candidate, it was Kennedy whose personal fame and personal draw, turned heads and inspired voters more than any other. \\nBut it was not to be. In an America drowning in blood both at home and in the jungles of Vietnam, Robert Kennedy was the victim of an assassination. In the summer of 1968, Kennedy had just won the crucial California primary and was addressing his supporters at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Just after he walked away from the podium, he was shot dead by the Palestinian gunman Sirhan Sirhan. \\nThe images of Robert Kennedy slouched dead on the floor become an iconic reminder that the 1960s for all of its counter-cultural optimism, was politically speaking, a very dark time for America. \\nHours ago, Donald Trump, a man who like Kennedy, challenged the pro-war establishment of his party and of Washington itself, was seemingly the victim of an attempted assassination plot. Although certain facts have yet to be revealed, what we do know is that a man making threatening gestures who is said to have had a gun was tackled by Trump’s supporters. Seconds later, security hurried Trump off state and arrested the would-be assassin. \\nIn spite of poor reporting from the ground, there are actually more facts at hand than there are mysteries. \\nDonald Trump has been vilified and dehumanized by the western mainstream media. His supporters are described as pigs, as the great unwashed, as the talentless, heartless and the stupid. He himself is described as much worse. Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters ‘deplorable’. In a country more ill at ease with itself than at any time since the Vietnam era, these words are very dangerous indeed. \\nMany sociologists postulate that the reason large sectors of the German population remained aloof and indifferent to the crimes of the fascist regime of the 1930s and 1940s, was because the victims of Hitlerism were purposefully constructed to be less than human by the state. Therefore a dead Russian, dead German Jew or dead Pole was somehow less of an issue than the death of a Hitler loving Teutonic man. \\nThe techniques applied to dehumanising Trump and his supporters are eerily similar. That is why, should any physical harm come to Donald Trump, the mainstream media have blood on their hands as much as any would be assassin. \\nTwo other things became clear. Donald Trump’s supporters warned him to leave for his own safety, they restrained the criminal, putting themselves in danger. It is fair to say, many of the brave men and women at the rally in Nevada were willing to give their lives for the man they support. This demonstrates that Trump’s supporters are not the savages that the mainstream media class them as. They are decent people who are angry at the path their country has taken and they feel a loyalty and fraternal bond with a man who speaks to them rather than at them, above them or around them. \\nHillary Clinton and her supporters in the media have put Donald Trump’s life in danger and the look on Trump’s face as he was hurried away by security, showed me a man who loves life, a man who deplores violence and a man who would not want to leave his family behind. I was tragically reminded of the scenes of Gaddafi’s assassination when he begged his executioners, ‘what have I done to you’. \\nThis is not a man who wants war, this is a man who wants to live in a world of peace, with all its joys, its profundities, its frivolities and its rough edges. \\nI am reminded of the words spoken by Marc Antony at the end of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar: \\n“This was the noblest Roman of them all: All the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great Caesar; He only, in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them. His life was gentle, and the elements So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world ‘This was a man!” \\nOne could say the same of Trump. \\nUpdate : The authorities have still not said whether the man in question had a gun or not, but the fact he has been released demonstrates either incompetence in terms of the investigation or that he was a hooligan rather than a would be murderer. Photos of the man emerged and as initial witnesses reported, he clearly looked deranged. \\nThe media has turned this election into a potentially deeply violent affair. All ready they are making the hooligan look like the victim rather than the assailant. This may well not end after the 8th of November. '],\n",

       " ['Sentencing for Murderer of Rare Book Dealer',\n",
       "  'This past week, on Monday, Oct. 24, 2016, a judge with the Oxford Crown Court in the United Kingdom sentenced Michael Danaher to life in prison for murdering rare book dealer, Adrian Greenwood. The purpose of the crime was to steal a rare first edition of the book, “The Wind in the Willows.” Danaher argued he killed Greenwood in self-defense, yet it only took two hours to render a unanimous guilty charge. Adrian Greenwood, 42, was found dead after being stabbed 30 times at his Oxford home in April.\\nProsecuting Attorney Oliver Saxby told the court that this was a “brutal” murder that included stab wounds to the “chest and neck and a deep wound to his back.” There was also evidence of torture and blunt wounds indicating Greenwood had been “stamped on.” The sentence Danaher received for murdering the rare book dealer was life in prison or no less than 34 years. Saxby explained to the court that Danaher stabbed Greenwood until the knife broke, after which he began beating him. Saxby went on to say that Danaher, “cool as you like, he helped himself to that first edition of ‘The Wind in the Willows,’ and Adrian Greenwood’s phone, and his laptop and his wallet.”\\nThe book is valued at £50,000 but Danaher listed it on eBay for only £2,000 after returning home from murdering Greenwood. Danaher learned that Greenwood was in possession of the book after he tried selling a copy on eBay in August of 2015. Danaher had been planning the crime for some time. He also had a list in an Excel file on his laptop titled “Enterprises” of other wealthy persons who were targets. It included their addresses, the method to be used like “stun gun” and the “expected take” from each target. Next to Greenwood’s name on the list Danaher wrote “Modus: Any!! Expected take: rare books.”\\nSaxby, the prosecutor, told the jury the wealthy targets on Danaher’s list “exudes a sense of resentment. It is almost as if these people who, because of their wealth . . . deserve to be subjected to what he has planned.” The jury was comprised of four women and eight men. The names on the list included Simon Cowel, Kate Moss, Jeffery Archer and others. About two weeks before Danaher’s attack on Greenwood, he tried to break into wealthy businessman Adrian Beecroft’s house pretending to be a delivery man, but Beecroft’s wife believed the man to be suspicious and “raised the alarm,” which caused Danaher to flee. He later drafted a letter on his laptop to Mrs. Beecroft demanding 200 bitcoin or about £96,000 for leaving them alone. The letter was never sent.\\nThe sentencing handed down by the Oxford Crown Court for murdering book dealer Greenwood over “Wind in the Willows” is perhaps a relief to those who were on his list. The author of the book is Kenneth Grahame and it was published in 1908. “Wind in the Willows” is a children’s book known for its “mixture of mysticism, adventure, morality and camaraderie.” Its text is available online for free as part of Project Gutenberg.\\nBy Joel Wickwire\\nSources:\\nBBC News – Man Guilty of Murdering Adrian Greenwood Over “The Wind in the Willow” Book\\nThe Guardian – Alleged Killer of Antiques Deal Had List of Famous Targets, Jury Told\\nThe Las Angeles Times – British Book Dealer Slain for His First Edition of “The Wind in the Willows”\\nTop and Feature Image Courtesy of Ken Wilcox’s Flicker Page – Creative Commons License\\nIn-Line Image Courtesy of Karen Cox’s Flickr Page – Creative Commons License\\n book'],\n",

       "  'Posted 11/15/2016 9:23 am by PatriotRising with 0 comments \\nAmericans have been to the polls. Everything is over but the shouting — by the loser, that is honest Hil. I predicted that the best Trump could have hoped for was winning the popular vote but losing the Electoral College but I got it wrong: the Donald has triumphed. An underfunded campaign — he spent barely half of what she did — with a skeletal crew and without the party’s full backing won out because not all of America agrees with the values of Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Springsteen, Hollywood in general and gay marriage in particular. \\n\\nTrump appealed to those who have been snubbed, the great ignored. They are mainly blue-collar whites who had long been belittled and overlooked by the media until suddenly their knight in a shiny gold Cadillac appeared. In a rare moment of openness, Hillary described these people as ‘deplorable’. Basically, Trump’s message was that to embrace extremism was to acknowledge the danger in absolute terms: no more Muslims coming in, no more Nafta, a wall to stop Mexicans, and so on. Even more profoundly, even nice, unsophisticated Americans wondered why Hillary or Obama had been so squeamish about calling a spade a spade, i.e., radical Islamic terrorism. As a Trump follower wrote, ‘Moderation in the pursuit of evil is no virtue. \\n\\nImperfect as Trump was a candidate, his enemies are the very same people who are shocked (in the manner of Captain Renault) by the ignorance of hoi polloi, and who decided long ago that these people are not to be trusted. You know the kind: Beltway insiders, media pundits, academics, policy professionals, Hollywood types, fashion elites, TV celebrities, professional race hustlers, gay activists; you name what’s in the news nowadays, they were against the Donald. They are part of the arrangement. Their European counterparts are in the EU, and among the Remainers. \\n\\nIf one had to slice it down even further, this election was basically the politically correct versus the politically incorrect. Although blue collars may not sound too sophisticated to snotty-nosed Beltway insiders, the blues know that this is no longer a war between nation states but a fight between civilizations: Islam and the West. An American president with an IQ lower than his younger daughter’s age invaded the Middle East, claiming that the region would welcome having American values imposed upon it. Hillary voted for that disastrous action; Trump was against it from the start. Americans see Europe and cringe. They see ‘Frenchmen’ cheering as their white countrymen are murdered in cold blood by Muslims and realize that this is a war fought by immigration. They put two and two together and calculate that in 100 years there will be more Muslims in Europe than white European Christians and that Sharia law will be imposed from above. And they also see a Dutch MP on trial for speaking against unlimited immigration, an MP, incidentally, who was refused entry to the UK for being right-wing, whatever that means. \\n\\nOne political philosopher at Oxford asked, ‘What gives a country the right to control its borders?’ Well, I’m asking who gave his mother the right to give birth to such a moron, but then not everyone is as rude as yours truly. And then, of course, the R-word comes into it. That’s what the election was and will be all about in the near future. Race is to America what immigration is to Europe: the large pachyderm crowding everyone out of the chic drawing-room in Chelsea. \\nWhites choose to live, as do blacks, among their own — if they have the choice. Churches self-segregate and whites flee to the suburbs once blacks move in next door. The elites, however, call this racism, although they would not dream of living next to a black family unless they were the Obamas, and then some. And as more and more Africans move to the States, there are more and more natives who feel a kind of cultural dispossession and a belief that Uncle Sam cannot thrive as an increasingly multiracial nation. Those who feel this way have been X-rated by the elites, and are called racists, homophobes, sexists, xenophobes and morally deformed. These people found a champion in Trump. \\n\\nAnd now a word about the fourth estate: I knew the fix was in long ago — never have the media been as incapable of separating fact from fiction and truth be damned — but when Vogue came out slamming Trump, I almost pissed in my St Laurent silk underwear. Never before have so many news outlets abandoned all pretence of fairness in reporting an election. Never before have newspapers — with the exception of the New York Times , which always mixes reporting news with editorialising — allowed reporters to express their opinions in so-called news stories. And the TV reportage was just as bad. You know the kind of thing: the pursed lips and air of healthy scepticism when it came to anything resembling a pro-Trump comment; the head tilt of doubt in response to any Trump announcement; the look of outraged authority when anyone defended Trump. The ones I found amusing were the lightweights of Vogue , those narcissistic onanists who somehow viewed Trump as an American version of Brexit. His hair and make-up was an affront to their preening self-importance. They minced their way to Hillary. \\n\\nBut the Donald has won and, best of all, the New York Times , the Washington Post , the New Yorker and the three main networks have once and for all disgraced themselves by proving they have no idea what this country is about. Yippee! \\n'],\n",

       "  'BREAKING : Hillary Clinton Had her MAID Print CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BREAKING : Hillary Clinton Had her MAID Print CLASSIFIED INFORMATION Breaking News By Amy Moreno November 6, 2016 \\nThe ineptitude and dangerous, reckless behavior of this nincompoop Hillary Clinton grows stronger every day. \\nJust when you think her stupidity and carelessness can’t get any worse, it does. \\nWe’re now learning that Hillary Clinton HAD HER MAID PRINT OUT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. \\nThat’s right – one more time….. \\nHillary Clinton had her MAID print out CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. \\nShe should be disqualified immediately. \\nFrom the NY Post: \\nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton routinely asked her maid to print out sensitive government e-mails and documents — including ones containing classified information — from her house in Washington, DC, e-mails and FBI memos show. But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material. \\nIn fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive e-mails that she may hold the secrets to E-mailgate — if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used. \\nClinton entrusted far more than the care of her DC residence, known as Whitehaven, to Santos. She expected the Filipino immigrant to handle state secrets, further opening the Democratic presidential nominee to criticism that she played fast and loose with national security. \\nClinton would first receive highly sensitive e-mails from top aides at the State Department and then request that they, in turn, forward the messages and any attached documents to Santos to print out for her at the home. \\nAmong other things, Clinton requested Santos print out drafts of her speeches, confidential memos and “call sheets” — background information and talking points prepared for the secretary of state in advance of a phone call with a foreign head of state. \\n“Pls ask Marina to print for me in am,” Clinton e-mailed top aide Huma Abedin regarding a redacted 2011 message marked sensitive but unclassified. \\nIn a classified 2012 e-mail dealing with the new president of Malawi, another Clinton aide, Monica Hanley, advised Clinton, “We can ask Marina to print this.” \\n“Revisions to the Iran points” was the subject line of a classified April 2012 e-mail to Clinton from Hanley. In it, the text reads, “Marina is trying to print for you.” \\nBoth classified e-mails were marked “confidential,” the tier below “secret” or “top secret.” \\nSantos also had access to a highly secure room called an SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility) that diplomatic security agents set up at Whitehaven, according to FBI notes from an interview with Abedin. \\nFrom within the SCIF, Santos — who had no clearance — “collected documents from the secure facsimile machine for Clinton,” the FBI notes revealed. \\nJust how sensitive were the papers Santos presumably handled? The FBI noted Clinton periodically received the Presidential Daily Brief — a top-secret document prepared by the CIA and other US intelligence agencies — via the secure fax. \\nA 2012 “sensitive” but unclassified e-mail from Hanley to Clinton refers to a fax the staff wanted Clinton “to see before your Netanyahu mtg. Marina will grab for you.” \\nYet it appears Clinton was never asked by the FBI in its yearlong investigation to turn over the iMac Santos used to receive the e-mails, or the printer she used to print out the documents, or the printouts themselves \\nAs The Post first reported, copies of Clinton’s 33,000 allegedly destroyed e-mails still exist in other locations and could be recovered if investigators were turned loose to seize them. Higher-ups at the Justice Department reportedly have blocked them from obtaining search warrants to obtain the evidence. \\nIt also appears the FBI did not formally interview Santos as a key witness in its investigation. \\nThis is a major oversight: Santos may know the whereabouts of a missing Apple MacBook laptop and USB flash drive that contain all of Clinton’s e-mails archived over her four years in office. \\nIn 2013, Hanley downloaded Clinton’s e-mails from her private server to the MacBook and flash drive. \\n“The two copies of the Clinton e-mail archive (one on the archive laptop and one on the thumb drive) were intended to be stored in Clinton’s Chappaqua and Whitehaven residences,” the FBI said in its case summary. \\nBut Hanley says the devices were “lost,” and the FBI says it “does not have either item in its possession.” \\nIn addition to Abedin, Santos worked closely with Hanley at Whitehaven and could shed light on the mystery — if only she were asked about it. \\nMy god. \\nAt this point, WHO hasn’t seen our classified information? \\nPerhaps that would be a shorter, more manageable list.

       " ['BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio',\n",
       "  'BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio 3 Shares Comments \\nFord’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. \\nThat’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work. \\nIt’s also good publicity for Ford ( F ), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there. \\nFord’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \\nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday. \\n“Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.” \\nThe move comes at a delicate time for Ford. \\nThe United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors ( GM ) and Fiat Chrysler ( FCAM ) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union. \\nThe union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn’t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It’s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs. \\n“We’re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven’t decided what will go there,” said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski. \\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he’s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States. \\n“How does that help us?” Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. “Mexico is becoming the new China.” '],\n",
       " [\"There Might Be Consequences for the GOP Presidential Candidates Who Won't Endorse Donald Trump\",\n",
       "  'Getty - Chip Somodevilla \\nEach Republican presidential candidate had to pledge their support for the eventual GOP nominee when they filed their initial statement of intent to run and be placed on the ballot in the South Carolina primary, no matter what. But it remains unclear of what will happen for candidates who break that rule. \\nWhen a candidate files to be on the ballot in South Carolina, they must write down their name and address before a signing below a paragraph that in part reads: \\n“I hereby affirm that I generally believe in and intend to support the nominees and platform of the Republican Party in the November 8, 2016 general election...” \\nBut a handful of Republicans have opted out of that promise to endorse Donald Trump, including Ohio Governor John Kasich, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former New York Governor George Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham. In addition, businesswoman Carly Fiorina withdrew her previous endorsement of Trump. \\nAnd if those candidates want to run again, they might face considerable hurdles in the Palmetto state, according to top Republican officials. \\nSouth Carolina Republican Party chairman Matt Moore told Independent Journal Review that there are “no definitive punishments related to South Carolina’s pledge” but that any candidate who refuses to back the nominee “does so at their own political peril,” adding: \\n“The political consequences would be in the minds of the voters. I expect that anyone who runs in 2020 without supporting the nominee in 2016 will find themselves in difficult situation in South Carolina.” \\nHowever, the party could impose restrictions on candidates who violate the pledge, if they want. Moore said that while the South Carolina GOP\\'s executive committee certainly has the authority to impose penalties, they have yet to meet on the subject. \\nMore stern on the prospect of penalizing candidates who do not get on board with Trump was Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said last month that the GOP is going to take a second look at how their members can launch presidential bids. \\n“And if they’re thinking they’re going to run again someday, I think that we’re going to evaluate the process,” Priebus said. \"And I don’t think it’s going to be that easy for them.” \\nAs to whether or not the GOP can bar individuals from running on their primary ballots, University of South Carolina associate professor Ben Means told Independent Journal Review that “political parties have a fair amount of discretion to control rights of participation,” so it would not matter all that much that candidates breached the contract. \\nThe South Carolina GOP could alter their rules to block the candidates from running again or they could absolve the disloyal candidates in the event of a catastrophic Trump loss. Either way, an evaluation of ballot access is in store for the Republican Party come November 9th. '],\n",

       "  'Shapiro Eviscerates Raucous Protesters At University Of Wisconsin By: Hank Berrien November 16, 2016 \\nDaily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro spoke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Wednesday night, and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him, found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium. \\nAfter the ovation he received on entering, Shapiro quipped, “Hey look at this. A campus that doesn’t actually try to arrest me when I come.” He continued, “Before I begin, I did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room. I hear you’ve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how you’re not one of these awful, terrible Trump people, that you’re sensitive, and that you want to signal your virtue, so I’ve brought along these safety pins, (holding up safety pins) and I also brought you something to wear them with – this diaper.\" \\nShapiro then held up a diaper, prompting huge laughs from the audience. \\nWhen a protester yelled at Shapiro that he should be “wearing a swastika,” Shapiro held out his yarmulke, then fired back, “In case you hadn’t noticed, the folks with the swastikas aren’t too nice to my type.” \\nShapiro continued, “Stop being self-indulgent children; stop pretending that everybody who voted for Trump is a vicious racist; it’s your right to protest, of course, but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a duly-held election … Donald Trump doesn’t care about your protest. Donald Trump is sitting somewhere in Trump Tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty, salty tears.” \\nReferring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who weren’t university students from attending Shapiro’s lecture, Shapiro opined: “I hear that a lot of folks at this publicly-funded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants. I do have a quick question: if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, why are so many people trying to ban American citizens from this community from coming to this lecture? And by the way, I’m aware of this private Facebook page titled ‘F(***) White Supremacy: Interrupting Ben Shapiro.\\' With all due respect, ‘F’ you right back, gang.” \\nAfter the applause subsided and Shapiro joked about how both Black Lives Mater and the KKK target him, the real fun began. Protesters stood up, chanting, “Shame” over and over again. \\nShapiro quipped, “Wow, it’s like Game of Thrones . Should I get undressed and walk down the aisle?” \\nThe bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters. Shapiro addressed the protesters, saying, “I’m happy to talk with you,” but they responded by screaming “safety” over and over. Shapiro joked, “Did somebody fart?” The crowd responded to the protesters by chanting, “USA.” \\nShapiro replied, “I tell you try not to be children; the first thing you do is start screaming like my two-year-old.” He added, “You see, this is how conservatives actually treat people; you stand up and you interrupt and you shout ‘Safety,” and you’re perfectly safe. Look at that. It’s amazing.” That provoked sustained applause. \\nWhen the protesters started screaming “Shame” again, Shapiro eviscerated them, pointing out, “If you’re going to pick a chant like ‘Shame,’ watch Game of Thrones first. The bad guys shout ‘Shame.’” The audience loved that line. On a roll, Shapiro continued, “You’re not changing anybody’s mind, All you’re showing everybody is that your collective IQ, if it were channeled into electricity, night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly.” \\nHe continued, “Okay, can we talk now, or are you going to keep shouting? Now’s your chance to get it out. Let’s hear your feelings. C’mon. Just go for it. Or is it going to be like every thirty seconds; like an annoying microwave timer?” \\nWhen the protesters resumed chanting, Shapiro responded, “If you guys want to talk, we can talk, If you want to shout, get the hell out.” More applause. \\nShapiro fired, “For God\\'s sake, at least wait until I say something that offends you before getting offended.\" \\nShapiro returned to deconstructing the term “social justice.” When the protesters started again, a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up, and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day, and that they should “shut freaking up and listen to the man speak.” That prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and Shapiro. too. He added, “See, that’s what a decent, hard-working person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime, presumably.” \\nShapiro returned to his speech: “Racial diversity doesn’t mean anything; decency means everything … Diversity isn’t our strength; decency is our strength.” He turned to the protesters: Remember that? Decency.” \\nThe protesters screamed back, “Shame!” Shapiro fired back, “Decency!” The protesters chanted “Shame” but the crowd soon joined Shapiro in chanting “Decency,” shutting the protesters up. \\nAs Shapiro spoke of the falsity of “white privilege,” the protesters formed a line in front of Shapiro, prompting him to quip, “If you guys are all going to come up here, can we all just have circle time or something?” \\nThe protesters chanted “Safety” for a minute and a half, but then the crowd started yelling back, “Free speech matters.” Shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters, “MORONS” That again prompted cheering. \\nOne member of the audience yelled to the protesters, “At least tell us what you want, or otherwise, just get out!” That brought a sustained ovation. \\nAfter one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue, the protesters started shouting “Safety” again, then filed out, yelling “F*** white supremacy” while flipping off Shapiro and the entire audience. That prompted the crowd to sing, “Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, good-bye.” It also promoted this from Shapiro: \\nEven after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door. \\nAfter Shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested, as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage, or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event, he continued, “All I can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event.” \\nEven after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door, prompting Shapiro to quip, “Doesn’t this school give homework? Does anybody have a job around here? I guess when you’re majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands.” \\nShapiro noted that he had engaged in a back-and-forth with one of the protesters, who accused him of being a white supremacist. When he asked her why she thought so, she replied that she got that impression from his image. He fired back, “Really? Was it the yarmulke that did it for you?” \\nHe took another shot at the protesters during the speech, noting that people were born unequal, and adding, “Some people us are born rich; some of us are born poor; some of us are born smart; some of us are born protesters.” \\nThe rest of the speech was vintage Shapiro, as was the Q&A afterward. Even the chalk was impressive: \\nWent back to the lecture hall and grabbed the EXACT piece of chalk @benshapiro used to write MORONS! #FactsNotFeelings #onlyatYAF pic.twitter.com/W0Ch06SaGR — Japheth Patterson (@japhood) November 17, 2016 \\n\\nVideo of entire event below: \\n'],\n",

       "  '1861 Views October 29, 2016 10 Comments Guest Posts The Saker \\nMoscow-Beijing Express, on The Saker \\nBy Jeff J. Brown, www.chinarising.puntopress.com \\nCrosslinked at: http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/10/29/putin-and-xi-in-western-propaganda-why-does-xjp-get-off-so-lightly-moscow-beijing-express-on-the-saker-161029/ \\nPodcast is available on SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/44-days/putin-and-xi-in-western-propaganda-why-does-xjp-get-off-so-lightly-161029 \\nBetter watch out, Vlad. When Western propaganda throws an “-ism” at you, the gloves have come off. Think Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, communism, socialism, extremism and “Islamic” terrorism, for starters. After all, behind the Great Western Firewall, they are all the same thing, right? \\nA recent cover and main article in the Economist, pictured above, reminded me of just how hyperbolic and ideological is the West’s propaganda against Russian President Vladimir Putin. While maybe good polemical fodder as a cartoon on the editorial page, the fact that this demonic caricature merits front cover status, indicates just how programmed and institutionalized Western mainstream media is. Westerners love to insult the Anti-West press for being “party organs” and “government mouthpieces”. But, why travel so far? They only need to stay home with their national New York Times , Radio France and BBC , to really appreciate Bernaysian psyops being passed off as serious journalism (as in Edward Bernays). I don’t call it living behind the Great Western Firewall for nothing. \\nI have a friend whose email signature is “Blame it on Putin”. For a while, he changed it to “Blame it on China”. But that didn’t last long and he recently changed it back. As we have seen with the most depressing predictability, President Putin, specifically, and Russia in general are the voodoo pin dolls of Western racism and demonization of another people (Slavs) and other religions (Orthodox Christianity, as well as widespread Islam and Buddhism in Siberia). http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2015/10/01/slavs-and-the-yellow-peril-are-niggers-brutes-and-beasts-in-the-eyes-of-western-empire-the-saker-44-days-radio-sinoland-2015-10-1/ \\nWhat is so remarkable is how unhinged and psychopathic the West’s racist propaganda is against Putin & Co., compared to the attacks on China’s President Xi Jinping (XJP) and the Chinese people. It transgresses irrational fear, to the point of being sick, black humor. Yet, about the most polemical front cover against XJP was Time magazine in April, 2016, seen below. But, making China’s leader look like a Mao Zedong- Blade Runner replicant is tame and almost quaint, compared to the Orwellian “Emmanuel Goldstein” tsunami being launched nonstop against Putin. \\nPretty tame stuff, this, compared to the racist feeding frenzy that Western propaganda is ginning up against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Slavic countrymen. \\nTrue, Russia has the longest border with the European Union, and there is tremendous historical Western precedence to keep Germany from forming any kind of economic or geopolitical alliance with Russia. As well, the West’s Ukrainian color revolution turned out to be a total genocidal failure, with Russia reintegrating Crimea and Donbass, biding its time for a hopeful remarriage in the years to come. Needless to say, the revenge factor, and if there is anything that Western tyranny loves more, it’s to avenge its long list of failed chaos and extermination around the world. \\nBut, Russia is officially a capitalist country. Its current constitution was largely written by American fifth columnists. The Russian Central Bank is widely presumed to be under the thumb of the West’s oil banking families. In spite of widespread ignorance around the world, on these two counts, China can definitely list itself in the opposing column. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/10/18/so-called-communist-china-an-exclusive-article-for-the-all-china-review-16-10-17/ . Given America’s post-1917, deranged, hysterical fear of, and untold billions spent to crush any communist expression around the world, you would think that red China and Xi would be Public Enemy Number One. But no, it’s Putin and the Russians. \\nOne factor might be Western perceptions of Russia’s and China’s military strength. Russians have shown off their powerful, well-run army, navy and air force in Syria and the Black Sea. The West is probably in a bit of an historic rut, when looking at China’s rapidly modernizing People’s Liberation Army (PLA), like back to the Korean War, when the just liberated New China had no air force, no navy and no nuclear missiles, yet still kicked the pants off Uncle Sam, using mostly World War I vintage arms. But then again, nobody in the West will ever admit that they lost the Korean War, in the first place. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/09/04/from-may-9th-in-moscow-to-september-3rd-in-beijing-the-anti-west-order-comes-full-circle-reprint/ . I can tell you that here in China, just like 1950-1953, XJP and the PLA do not fear American military power, not one iota. Respect it, yes. Fear it, never. President Xi has put the PLA on combat ready war footing and he means it. http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/966932.shtml \\nBut there is a new gadfly in America’s imperial ointment, one who may push President Xi and the Chinese people up the racist hate-o-meter, to Slavic levels, and that menace is the Philippines’ new president, Rodrigo Duterte. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/09/17/puppet-japan-saves-uncle-sams-face-in-south-china-sea-after-philippines-principled-stand-vs-imperialism-jeff-j-brown-on-press-tv/ . This plainspoken, no bullshit world leader is Uncle Sam’s worst nightmare. He is calling American empire what it is: genocidal, dictatorial and rapacious. Not once, but day after day, meeting after meeting, press conference after press conference. \\nAt September 8-9, 2016’s ASEAN summit in Laos, Duterte showed a colonial era photo and talked about the genocide that the US committed, as it brutally conquered the Philippines, 1899-1913, killing an estimated 1.25 million people, about 25% of the nation’s population. Western media censored it like the plague and even semi-friendly outlets like the South China Morning Post were aghast that he actually associated the West with genocide. Heaven forbid! This, in spite of the fact the easily 80-90% of the history’s genocides and exterminations were and are being perpetrated by Eurangloland, including of course Israel. Behind the Great Western Firewall, genocide is exclusively reserved for powerless, dark skinned people and unrepentant socialists, like Serbia’s framed and destroyed Slobodan Milosevic. \\nSpeaking truth to imperial power, Duterte gives a blunt lesson on Western genocide, during the recent ASEAN summit in Laos. How dare you tell it like it is! (Image by Baidu.com) \\nDuterte is a semi-official socialist-populist. His cabinet is inclusive and consultative, with former imprisoned and exiled political opposition leaders, including communists and Muslims. He clearly can’t stand America’s grotesque, imperial arrogance and tyranny, in a country that has been a pliant doormat for US mayhem and exploitation in Asia, going back to the turn of the 19 th -20 th century. When Duterte’s hometown of Davao was hit with a very suspicious, false flag smelling public market bombing, on September 2, 2016, he suggested that the automatic-to-blame Abu Sayyef Group, a Muslim independence outfit on his island of Mindanao, is controlled by US Special Forces based there, which is of course true. But, world leaders aren’t supposed to speak truth to power, especially “little brown brothers”, as Filipino Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay has described America’s attitude to his long suffering and abused nation. http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/09/17/1624575/dfa-chief-philippines-no-little-brown-brother-us \\nAfter signing with XJP more than three times as many development deals ($15 billion), as the US has totally invested to date in the Philippines ($4.7 billion), Duterte declared to the world that the “US has lost” and that his country was realigning with Baba Beijing. His official government/trade delegation had an unprecedented 300 members and another 150 business people paid their own way to join the Asian lovefest. The two sides set up bilateral committees to discuss and negotiate their South China Sea claims, which is anathema to Uncle Sam, who always insists on being the rabid Rottweiler in the middle. Next stop was US prostitute Japan, where he further declared that the Philippines would be free of all foreign military (meaning US marines and special forces), something that has not happened since 1521, when Spain began colonizing and raping the archipelago. \\nThis is all very powerful, history changing geopolitics. Almost every other world leader who has talked and acted like this, has either been overthrown and/or murdered by the West, sooner than later. Clearly, from the perspective of the West, Duterte’s visionary, regional reset is closely tied to President Xi and China. It is for this reason that XJP may be getting the Slavic-Putin treatment on an accelerated schedule, in a desperate attempt to trash China’s deep, historical leadership and trust role in Asia. \\nThe old story about people being able to see that the emperor is not wearing any clothes, is very apropos to Duterte. He is shouting out to the world that Western empire is a colossal failure and humiliation for his impoverished, exploited citizens, and by extension, equally so for every other member of humanity outside Eurangloland. http://chinarising.puntopress.com/2016/07/16/communist-china-vs-capitalist-philippines-vs-imperial-france-china-rising-radio-sinoland-160716/ . Once one person pierces the veil, it emboldens others to finally have the courage to pile on. \\nFor Uncle Sam, it’s already happening. Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak is visiting XJP and Co. in Beijing, October 31-November 6, 2016, an unusually long state visit by a world leader. Najib has declared that Malaysia is committed to strengthening friendship with China and pushing ties to “new highs”. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-china-idUSKCN12R0ZU . As more and more countries embrace China’s history founding One Belt One Road plan, in which the whole world is and will benefit into the 22 nd century, including Eurangloland, expect ever more desperate, racist demonization and dehumanization of Xi Jinping and the Chinese people, along the lines of Putin and the Russians. Maybe the CIA-MI6 can dig up that old 19 th century chestnut, “The Yellow Peril”, and give it a modern day makeover. Stay tuned to the New York Times, Radio France and the BBC , as the propaganda psyops campaign takes shape. \\nAs more and more world leaders are emboldened to speak out against Western tyranny, thanks to Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte’s courage to make a public stand, President Xi Jinping can expect his face to morph into Putin’s, who is demonically pictured above on a January, 2014 Newsweek cover. \\nCheck out Jeff’s newest book, the top selling China Rising – Capitalist Roads, Socialist Destinations : '],\n",

On November 18, 2015, the New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding.\\nOn October 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department, overturned the lower court’s decision. In its ruling, the Appellate Court stated that the BZA does not have the authority to impose the durational limit on the restaurant’s parking lot because the Town Code does not confer any such power to limit the life of the approval.\\nZoning boards routinely impose durational limits on various types of approvals given for commercial uses. Businesses often object to these time restrictions as being unfair and unnecessary burdens on their property rights because, by limiting the life of a zoning approval, zoning boards force businesses to regularly seek renewed permission for their ongoing operations.\\n“We are pleased with the Court’s decision,” Mr. Browne said. “We believe it strikes the proper balance between the rights of a commercial property owner and the need for the Town to protect the interest of the surrounding neighborhood.”\\nNicholas J.

The footage reveals Abedin’s extensive personal ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and that her mother is a member of the group’s counterpart organization for women. When she began interning for Clinton at the age of 20, Abedin was also working for a Jihadist legal publication which endorsed Sharia law. In addition, Abedin’s family has links to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Anonymous also released a video detailing Clinton’s own criminal past. \\nIf you haven’t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment... '],\n",

Looks like the SJWs are very excited to hear @benshapiro tonight! pic.twitter.com/hkd3YgIwMn — Caleb Ecarma (@calebecarma) November 1, 2016 \\nThere has been no explanation as to who decorated the chalkboard, nor whether the culprit wanted to issue a more eloquent denunciation of Shapiro but was hindered by the limits of his/her vocabulary, thus being restricted to words of three letters or less. \\nShapiro’s usual denunciation of political correctness is likely the reason for the gratuitous insult; in October 2015, Clemson was plagued by PC when a few students protested Clemson Dining’s \"Maximum Mexican\" night, tweeting their displeasure with such a \"#CUlturallyInsensitive\" event. Clemson senior Austin Pendergist told Campus Reform the post-event uproar was “ridiculous … This is something that Clemson Dining has done for years without any sort of backlash. People love the cultural nights in the dining halls. What\\'s next? Are they going to take away all potato based food as to not offend students from Irish decent? Remove the stir fry station so Asian-American students don\\'t feel as if they are being misrepresented? When does it end?” \\nBut the administration wound up apologizing for the event; Dr. Doug Hallenbeck, Clemson University’s Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs, said the event displayed a “flattened cultural view of Mexican culture … It is the mission of University Housing & Dining to create supportive and challenging environments that enrich and nourish lives. We failed to live out our mission yesterday, and we sincerely apologize,” adding that the university “will continue to work closely with [its] food service provider to create dining programs that align with Clemson University’s core values.” \\nThe administration also apologized on the Clemson Dining Services Facebook and Twitter pages. \\nPendergist said the event had only featured “a couple balloons, sombreros, and some tacos,” adding, “For as long as I\\'ve been here, and probably for much longer, Clemson dining has put on certain culinary theme nights, where they decorate the dining halls and serve whatever kind of food.

       " ['Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield is Shielding What? | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Syria Turkey, in a bid to legitimize its uninvited, illegal incursion into northern Syria, has created several media platforms specifically reporting on what it calls “Operation Euphrates Shield.” Operation Euphrates Shield, according to official Turkish government statements, aims at “securing” a buffer zone in northern Syria spanning from the Euphrates river in the east and extending all the way to Azaz in the west. This is also coincidentally the exact same buffer zone US policy think tanks have called for since at least 2012 – specifically seeking Turkey to implement it. The Brookings Institution – a corporate-funded policy think-tank whose policymakers have helped craft upper-level strategy for the Iraqi, Afghan, Libyan, and now Syrian conflicts as well as plans laid for future confrontations with Iran and beyond – has been explicit regarding the true nature of these “buffer zones.” In a 2015 paper titled, “ Deconstructing Syria: A new strategy for America’s most hopeless war ,” it states: …the idea would be to help moderate elements establish reliable safe zones within Syria once they were able. American, as well as Saudi and Turkish and British and Jordanian and other Arab forces would act in support, not only from the air but eventually on the ground via special forces. The paper goes on by explaining (emphasis added) : The end-game for these zones would not have to be determined in advance. The interim goal might be a confederal Syria, with several highly autonomous zones and a modest (eventual) national government. The confederation would likely require support from an international peacekeeping force, if this arrangement could ever be formalized by accord. But in the short term, the ambitions would be lower—to make these zones defensible and governable, to help provide relief for populations within them, and to train and equip more recruits so that the zones could be stabilized and then gradually expanded. Despite claims that Turkey’s actions are necessary to “stop” the self-proclaimed “Islamic State” (ISIS) and help end the deadly conflict raging in Syria, it is clear that instead, Turkey is carving out territory specifically to shelter militants fighting the Syrian government in an attempt to perpetuate, even expand the violence for as long and as extensively as possible. Joint operations between Washington and Ankara in Manbji, a well-known waypoint for Islamic State fighters, weapons and equipment coming from Turkey bound for Raqqa, would effectively open “a second front” in the ongoing fight to drive the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from Syria’s borders, [Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu] said. It was Turkey’s own foreign minister who was quoted by the Washington Times in an article written just before Turkey embarked on its invasion titled, “ Turkey offers joint ops with U.S. forces in Syria, wants Kurds cut out ,” admitting that ISIS was being supplied and reinforced specifically from within Turkish territory. The article stated (emphasis added): It is thus abundantly clear that ISIS sprung into being and has since sustained itself through extensive state sponsorship – sponsorship that has flowed freely over Syria’s borders with Turkey and Jordan. Any genuine attempt to cripple the source of ISIS’ fighting capacity would require securing the Turkish and Jordanian borders with Syria, not invading Syria itself. As ISIS Disappears, Militants Magically Multiply Operation Euphrates Shield can be followed on popular social media platforms, including Twitter. Turkish officials regularly post self-incriminating updates regarding their activities within Syrian territory. On October 21, the operation’s official Twitter account claimed : \\nTurkish Army-backed FSA has tripled number of its soldiers thanks to its achievements against terrorist organizations. However, this claim is highly problematic. The process of crossing a battlefield successfully alone does not “increase” the number of soldiers fighting in one’s army unless militants an army is engaged against are recruited into the advancing force. “Liberated” civilians would not be able to simply “join” Turkish-backed militant groups. A responsible military commander knows that incorporating untrained civilians into a military force without at least 1-3 months of basic training creates more disadvantages and dangers than any benefits gained from “tripling” the size of one’s force. Additionally, men of fighting age found on the battlefield in areas Turkish-backed troops are advancing through must be vetted to ensure they have no ties to terrorist organizations including ISIS – yet Turkey’s government has not given any details on how these “new fighters” are being either vetted or trained. In other words, it simply seems as if Turkey is attempting to explain why – within the buffer zone it is creating – numbers of militants are swelling without admitting that the entire purpose of the buffer zone in the first place is and always was to provide a sanctuary for Al Qaeda, ISIS, and other extremist forces inside Syria just as Turkey has provided them sanctuary in Turkey for the last 5 years. Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield is indeed a shield wielded by Turkey and its US partners. But it is a shield lifted up not in defense of the Syrian people or the Turkish state itself, but instead brought to face those forces decisively defeating Al Qaeda and ISIS deeper within Syria and poised to push remaining militants out of Syria, permanently. With the establishment of a Turkish occupied buffer zone – as imagined by US policy makers who crafted this operation for Turkey long ago – it will now be exceedingly difficult to eradicate remaining militants at the edge of Syrian territory after they are defeated and driven out of the nation’s interior. Indeed Turkey is shielding a region west of the Euphrates, not from terrorists, but to protect them.

In the words of Donald Trump, our country is a disaster.” Once again echoing the pronouncements of president-elect Trump, Leidecker noted that we sadly won’t be able to rely on Washington to change anything, as our political system is largely run by self-serving, power-hungry factionalists who don’t have the best interests of common Americans at heart.

       " ['Will Trump Dump The Wahabbi Autocrats? | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Saudi Arabia US leaders almost always justify their foreign policy with words about “democracy” and “human rights.” Especially when talking about the Middle East, the insincerity of such words are blatantly obvious. While US leaders criticize Iran and Syria for alleged human rights violations, the entire world can see that the US allies in the region are serial human rights violators. Israel has been widely condemned for its treatment of Palestinians. Saudi Arabia is a country where even the basic notion of human rights does not exist. The Kingdom is an absolute monarchy where people can still be executed by beheading or crucifixion in the 21st century. Crimes punishable by death under the Saudi regime include “sorcery” and “insulting the King.” Under Saudi law, the people are not citizens with rights, but rather “subjects” who are essentially the King’s property. Qatar is yet another repressive regime. Like Saudi Arabia, it is an absolute monarchy, where a King serves as the unelected autocrat. Bahrain is known not only for its lack of democratic structures, but for its repression of the Shia Muslim majority who frequently take to the streets, demanding their rights. The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, and almost every other US-aligned regime in the Arab world has a primitive political system, centered on an autocratic monarchy. These regimes are known to torture, behead, flog, repress free speech, oppress religious minorities, and do all kinds of things US leaders claim to oppose. This does not prevent the United States from selling weapons to these regimes, or from purchasing their oil. This also does not prevent the USA from establishing military bases on their soil, and otherwise coddling them. In fact, the Financial Times describes how the United Arab Emirates is becoming a beloved “tax haven” for the rich and powerful in the western world. While western leaders love to talk about human rights, they have no problem with autocratic emirates handling their money . The Roots of Wahabbi Terrorism More shockingly, the involvement of these regimes in terrorism has not deterred US support. It took 15 years for the classified 28 pages of the 9/11 Commission report to be released. The pages revealed that Saudi government officials had collaborated with the 9/11 hijackers. It furthermore revealed that Saudi Arabia had been uncooperative and offered minimal support to US officials with their investigations during the aftermath of the attacks. The Saudi Royal family owes its reign to the British Empire. During the 1800s the British discovered that the House of Saud were useful allies against the Ottoman Empire, and were more than willing to sell their oil at a reasonable price. The Saudi monarchy professes a particularly conservative brand of Islam known as “Wahabbism.” While not every Wahabbi has been involved in terrorism, Al-Queda, ISIS, Al-Nusra, Osama Bin Laden, Omar Mateen, and nearly every Middle-Eastern or Central-Asian terrorist who has menaced the world in recent years has been an adherent of Wahabbism. Wahabbism is particularly anti-Western and anti-American. Opponents of the Saudi ideology it often call it “Takfirism,” a term that refers to Wahabbi’s willingness to kill other Muslims with whom they disagree. The relationship between Wahabbi fanatics and Britain’s wealthy has not ended. A recent article in the Financial Times describes how British Houses of Finance now specialize in “Islamic Banking.” While many Islamic scholars describe the very concept as fraudulent, many financial institutions are accommodating sultans, emirates, and princes who adhere to strict Wahabbi laws. Islam forbids lending money for interest, so many financial institutions have invented loopholes with hidden fees, investment returns, and other mechanisms that can accommodate strict adherents . During the 1980s, the CIA worked with the heir of a wealthy Saudi construction dynasty to build a Wahabbi army. Osama bin Laden was sent to Afghanistan to build an army of “Mujihadeen” to topple the People’s Democratic Party. The USA worked closely with the fanatical Wahabbi terrorists to battle the Marxist government of Afghanistan and their Soviet allies. Currently, the United States works with Saudi Arabia to fund a Wahabbi insurgency against the secular Syrian Arab Republic. ISIS and Al-Nusra are known to be terrorists inspired by the Saudi ideology. The Saudis have been caught directly helping them out. Among the US backed “moderate rebels,” many Wahabbis can also be found. Most of the various US-aligned autocracies in the Middle East can be linked to Wahabbi forces in Syria. Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and other regimes have made the goal of “regime change” in Syria a priority, and many ISIS fighters have emerged from their respective populations. Is The Tide Turning? While the past three presidencies of Bush, Obama, and Clinton have involved massive coddling of the Saudi regime, Donald Trump often spoke against Saudi Arabia during his Presidential campaign. Furthermore, in a recent move, the US Congress dramatically overrode Barack Obama’s veto, and passed the controversial JASTA bill, allowing victims of terrorism to sue the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in US courts. While Trump often appealed to ignorant and Islamophobic sentiments among Americans, he also appealed to an isolationist desire to stop meddling around the world. Trump made fighting ISIS, the Wahabbi extremist group unleashed amid US-Saudi regime change efforts, a key plank of his campaign. Will Trump live up to his words? Will the USA end its alliance with Pro-Wahabbi autocratic regimes that are linked to terrorism? Though Trump spoke against the Saudis and talked of fighting ISIS, his campaign included reckless denunciations of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Trump’s speeches often seemed to lump Iran in with ISIS, ignoring the fact that Iranian Revolutionary Guards are on the battlefield each and every day, risking their lives to defeat ISIS. Iran is greatly threatened by ISIS terrorism. ISIS and most Wahabbis consider the Islamic Republic of Iran to be led by “Shia Apostates.” ISIS and other anti-government forces in Syria have recruited fighters from around the world on the basis of toppling Syrian President Bashar Assad because of his Alawi faith, which Wahabbis consider to be a variation of Shia apostasy. \\nContradictory Middle East Positions For too long, the USA has been targeting secular, nationalist governments like the Baathist regimes of Iraq and Syria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or Gaddafi’s Libya. In doing so they have been passively helping and strengthening the bloodthirsty Wahabbi fanatics who these regimes have held back, and whose ideological foundation is promoted by Saudi Arabia. If Trump is serious about stopping ISIS and the surrounding wave of Wahabbi terrorism, he will immediately end the US financial and military relationship with the Saudi regime, as well as the nearby, pro-Wahabbi autocracies. Furthermore, Trump will need to end his irresponsible demonization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and join with the Iranians, the Russians, the Syrian government, and China in the fight against ISIS terrorism. If Trump were to do this, it would be one of the most dramatic shifts ever seen in US foreign policy. During his campaign, Trump has taken two somewhat contradictory positions in relation to the Middle East. While he has denounced Saudi Arabia and talked about how US “regime change” policies have strengthened terrorism, he has also repeated the anti-Iranian talking points of Netanyahu, and spoken with great admiration for Israel. Israel has been the greatest direct beneficiary of the US policy in the Middle East. Each regime the US has targeted in the region–Syria, Iraq, and Iran–have been outspoken opponents of Israel who directly support Palestinian resistance. Meanwhile, the Wahabbi-linked autocrats denounce Israel in words, but do very little to threaten its existence or strength. Israel’s primary enemies, Iran and Syria, are also the primary target of the Wahabbi fanatics and the Saudi monarchy. Israeli and Saudi Arabia may denounce each other, but their foreign policies both center on hostility to what the Saudis call “the Shia crescent.” Regarding the Middle East, the new President will be forced to decide whether he seeks to continue aligning US and Israel foreign policies, and targeting Iran and Syria, or whether he wants to end Wahabbi terrorism, and stop cooperating with the regimes actively linked to it. Trump is often perceived as quite unpredictable. Whichever choice he makes, it is likely to surprise many people. Caleb Maupin is a political analyst and activist based in New York.

Possibly the most shocking on the list was their number one most unhealthy career in America: dentists, dental surgeons and dental assistants. \\nOther surprises on the list include flight attendant, veterinarian and podiatrist. While many of these may not seem to make sense at first, after a closer look, one begins to understand the thinking and the process behind the rankings.

Unfortunately for dentists, they hit a double-whammy on those factors plus several other aspects of the job that are viewed as unhealthy. \\nThe list also includes several of the old hits like chemical plant and systems operator, radiologist and derrick operators. However, even the order of some of these and the dangerous attributes attributed to them can be surprising. \\nPerhaps I shouldn’t admit this, but there were even some on the list that were surprising simply because of their existence.

       "  'Region: Middle East As one cold expect t he Arab countries, just like any other state in the world, were following closely the US presidential campaign. This is understandable, since the people of this war-torn regio n are kin to know what the White House is going to do in the next four years and in which way this will affect the Middle East . As for Barack Obama that is going to leave office pretty soon, it’s hardly a secret that local media sources w ere criticizing his polic ies in strong language. “ Obama’s legacy in the Middle East — is a complete disaster, as the conflict in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya continue, while being unaddressed. ” Al Jazeera would often write, quoting a speech delivered by the famous professor of international affairs at Harvard, Stephen Walt. T errorist attacks are shaking Turkey, Tunisia, Lebanon, while the situation in Palestine remains unclear , since the prospect s of a n actual settlement between Israelis and Palestinians are becoming increasingly remote. The steps that the US has taken in Libya and Yemen have led to their complete collapse as states . At the same time, all Obama ever did was to repeat his mantra that “Assad should leave”, which only aggravated the war in Syria. The only achievement that Obama can somehow put on his scoreboard — is the the Iran nuclear deal . According to the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, “ this campaign has been so scandalous , it is unlikely that the US will be able to recover from it in the near future .” “ If America was perceived as a beacon of democracy, its lights have considerably dimmed recently. ” – says the Lebanese Daily Star. The remarks of Haed Al Maena, a Saudi journalist writing for the Saudi Gazette were particularly bold. “ Th is election campaign was the most polarized one in the U S history, ”– he would note . Analyzing the course of the election campaign, the author concludes that “ the Arabs have to rely on themselves, instead of expecting anything from America .” The journalist subjected Hillary Clinton to particularly harsh criticism by claiming that “ she’s been kissing ground the Israelis walk on , going as far as promis ing to invite Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu as the first foreign visitor to the White House in case of her victory . She announced strong support for the Israeli government, which occupies other peoples’ land, murdering children and carrying on the worst form of apartheid known to men… This woman does not feel any remorse — we can just remember her insulting remarks about her husband’s rape victims . The recent revelations released by the WikiLeaks show that she believes that the destruction of Syria will be beneficial to Israel .” The Middle Eastern ruling and media elites alike resided on the assumption t hat Hillary Clinton would win. That is why Trump’s success was rather unexpected, which in turn created a massive confusion. Now all the attention is paid to the detailed study and analysis of all the statements the next president of the United States has ever made . One may remember T ru mp ‘s remarks about him being o n the same side with Russia and the Syrian regime in the fight against ISIS, instead of creating a no-fly zone that Hillary Clinton was advocating. Many Arab journalist are stressing the part of Trump’s speech at the National Convention of the Republican Party in July 2016, where he accused the Obama administration of forcing America to bow to China, Mexico, Russia and the Islamic state. However, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to Trump’s attitude towards Islam and the Muslim refugees. The Al Jazeera has already pu blished an article under the title President of Islamophobia, which stated that Trump rose to the heights of power due to his Islamophobic campaign, and now Islamophobia has b ecome the US official policy. It was noted that at first, when in one of the speeches Trump proposed a ban against Muslims entering the United States, this position received no approval. However, in March 2016, according to the survey, a significant portion of the US population fully supported this approach . One must note that Trump’s position on the Arab-Israeli conflict is also rather sensitive for the Arab world . Trump, notes the above mentioned journalist Khalid Al Maena, would bring no good for the Arab s, since he’s naive and un experienced and will only do what he believes is good for himself. And really – Al Maena concludes — “ how can one treat Arabs with sympathy, if they are at each other’s throats.” A number of Arab commentators have already noted that Trump ‘s positiv e remarks about Israel, as some of them claim that he promise d to move the US embassy to Jerusalem — the declared but not recognized c apital of the Israeli state. The Jerusalem Post would stress that t he victory of pro- Israeli right-wing Trump would be ” the end of the P alestinian state. “ Vladimir Mashin, Ph.D. in History and a political commentator, exclusively for the online magazine “New Eastern Outlook” .

       "  'Gallup: Americans More Confident In Trump Since Election By: Robert Kraychik November 16, 2016 A Gallup poll published on Wednesday indicates that 51% of Americans are more confident in Donald Trump’s ability to serve as president following last week’s presidential election. 40%, conversely, are less confident. Partisanship was strongly correlated with the poll’s respondents’ responses: 95% of Trump voters said they were more confident in presidential capacity after the election, with 75% of Clinton voters saying they were now less confident. The same question was put to Americans by Gallup following the 1992 and 2000 presidential elections. Five weeks after the 1992 election, 84% of Bill Clinton voters said they were more confident in his presidential capability as opposed to 23% of George H. Bush voters and 37% of Ross Perot voters. In 2000, 85% of George W. Bush voters were more confident in his ability to be president as opposed to 29% of Al Gore voters. H/T Kaitlyn Scallhorn at The Blaze '],\n",
       " ['Does Trump Have a Fighting Chance Against the Establishment | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World When countries are in trouble they always react the same way. If they have economic troubles their governments take ever greater control of the public finances, whether through austerity or centrally-dictated spending programmes. When there is civil strife the government calls out the army and restricts liberties to regain control of the situation. When wars are taking place elections are cancelled so the government of the day remains in power to deal with the conflict. These measures have the effect of entrenching the “Establishment”, whoever that may be at a given time, and excluding others. People can only play a part in addressing the problems of the country at the whim of the Establishment, with appointments replacing elections in many such scenarios. Only when the Establishment is secure does it allow greater freedom of debate, action and participation, which are regarded as the hallmarks of stable countries . Now Donald Trump has been elected President of the United States on an avowedly anti-Establishment platform. He tapped into those disaffected by the political system and found the issues on which he could make the most noise. That in itself was a virtue with the constituency he was trying to attract. Too many people have become disaffected with politics everywhere because someone has decreed certain views to be unacceptable, without giving a reason why, and Trump was only too happy to give voice to those who have been told that their views don’t entitle them to one. But is Trump’s election the democratic revolution he claims? Does it actually give a voice to the voiceless and power to the powerless? In order to exercise any power President Trump will have to do all the things he accuses his opponents in the Establishment of, but worse. For a while he might get away with it, but he will never have the resources to win in the longer term. All we will have is the methods, with no returns: Establishment oppression on a scale beyond the worst nightmares of the enforced nobodies who now think they are somebody, but are in fact Donald Trump. Who do you think you are? As it turned out, Hillary Clinton failed to get past a problem she would not have had as a Republican. If you are on the conservative end of the political spectrum you are expected to act like you belong in power when you have it. People in more progressive parties claim to represent the interests of the broad mass of people who will never be rich and powerful. If they stay in power for too long, they create a distance between themselves and that mass which erodes their natural support. Hillary Clinton has been a national figure in the US for a generation. Her accession to the Democratic nomination was seen as almost dynastic, a factor which harmed Senator Edward Kennedy when he ran for the Democratic nomination against Jimmy Carter in 1980. She was referred to as the “Establishment candidate” throughout the campaign, particularly by members of her own party who preferred socialist Bernie Sanders, who complained throughout the primary process that the voting was being rigged and that the media were falsely reporting that she had won the nomination before it was mathematically certain . For a Republican, all this would play well, except in extreme circumstances such as Watergate. For a Democrat it was bound to depress enthusiasm in the party’s voter base, and either drive it to another candidate or persuade it to stay at home, particularly when enough scandal attaches to Clinton as it is due to her business and government dealings. Clinton was about her nice office in Washington, not the problems of real Democrats. Keeping her there would have solved nothing. This was seen most clearly in Wisconsin, a traditional Democratic mainstay which voted for Trump despite the fact exit pollsters were showing that a large numbers of voters greatly disliked both he and Clinton . Many of those who disliked Trump still voted for him because they felt disliked themselves by politicians such as Clinton, who had let them down more than a newcomer had been able to do. He was “the-none-of-the-above” candidate from early on in the primary election period. Poacher turns gamekeeper Whether Trump would have got anywhere near the Republican nomination had there been a Republican president for the last eight years is unlikely. Only as an outsider could he gain any traction within a party which thinks of itself as the natural party of government, and would pick an insider every time to maintain its hold on power. The Republican Party will remain largely embarrassed by Trump, despite his victory. He may be the voters’ idea of a president, but he isn’t what Republican politicians see as a Republican president. As the Huffington Post published underneath every article about Trump from January until election day, “Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims – 1.6 billion members of an entire religion – from entering the US.” Ask most Republican Congressmen, who control both houses, whether this describes a Republican President and you know what the answer will be, though Trump himself revels in such depictions. Well before the end of his term Trump will have become the Establishment himself. So to achieve anything in the checks and balances system the US has he will either have to carry the party and the military-industrial establishment with him, and become more embedded than Clinton is to do it, or try and purge the very many who will oppose him. Throughout his “business career”, if repeated bankruptcy, con, robbing of contractors and tax avoidance can be dignified with such a term, Trump has relied on bluster and a stubborn refusal to face reality to prosper. Whether he can get away with that with the military and intelligence staff who have ruined America’s global reputation with impunity is another matter. Presidents who spent lifetimes working the system have not been able to control the CIA or the industrial and media barons. If Trump tries, he will have to exert extreme control to do it, and become more exclusive than the Establishment itself. Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976 as an antidote to a corrupt political establishment. Despite his long years of public service, he was discarded four years later for being exactly what he was elected to be – a good man out of his depth in murky Washington. Trump has never held any elected office. Is he going to take on those same forces and turn them into public servants? More than he can chew out \\nOne of Trump’s selling points with poorer Americans is that he pledged to stop US involvement in costly foreign wars. In particular, he said he could work with Russia and saw no need for the continual war rhetoric coming out of every Western government. Obviously this plays well with those who can’t afford to feed their families. The money will be spent on them, not bombs. But is it even possible to reduce the US military commitment, with so many bases, so many troops employed, so many weapons which will be manufactured and sold regardless? Trump may well find that the best way to stop foreign wars is to buy up all the weapons so that potential enemies don’t get them. The War on Terror would greatly diminish if the US didn’t supply arms to its favourite terrorists whilst pretending to fight them. But there is a vast industry devoted to maintaining armament and troop levels, which can only be justified by fighting wars against enemies real or imagined . So how would Trump go about achieving such a goal? Trump and his supporters are sons and daughters of the Bolsheviks. Convinced they are right, they think they can say what they like, do what they like and everyone else just has to put up with it because any opponent is part of the corrupt Establishment. It is no coincidence that Nigel Farage, former leader of UKIP and the main proponent of the UK leaving the European Union, has described Trump’s victory as a “ Supersized Brexit . Farage’s supporters behave the same way: everyone they don’t like hasn’t got the right to an opinion anymore, because they lost, and were inherently bad to begin with. Based on all we have seen so far, if someone stands in the way of Trump’s ambitions as president they will be told that they are holdovers from a corrupt system, serving masters who are now enemies of the people, and must therefore be removed. In order to get rid of them he would have to use extralegal measures in many cases, and deny them an opinion or another job. The “people” Trump would be referring to are the dispossessed whose votes he courted, who by definition don’t have levers of power of their own. It hardly gives those people more power to demonise certain individuals on presidential say-so, but that is all Trump has offered so far, or may ever be capable of offering. Trump has enjoyed spreading hatred of various minority groups. As many commentators have pointed out, he has broken all the usual rules of presidential candidate conduct and got away with it. But this simply makes anyone a potential victim, and encourages such behaviour to go on unchecked. A system which was there long before a here-today-gone-tomorrow politician has all the levers his supporters don’t to maintain itself. But if attacked, it will have no alternative but to fight fire with fire. A battle for control fought behind the scenes would empower Trump’s supporters even less, whilst not addressing the specific problems which made them see Trump as the solution. Not beating them, only joining them This presidential election campaign was the ugliest within living memory. This played into Trump’s hands: it brought those who were told they couldn’t behave like that into the mainstream, and Trump as the outsider reaped the benefit. But it also created the expectation that this will be followed through: if you start such a process, you are expected to finish it. A poll taken just before Election Day showed that if Bernie Sanders had been running against Clinton and Trump he would have won by a landslide . Sanders supporters remain angry that he was denied the nomination by what they thought was an establishment fraud. Now Clinton has lost, they will make further efforts to ensure that anyone with Clinton credentials is neutralised so that they can present a more credible candidate in 2020, and will have much moral weight and grassroots sympathy behind this effort. As Clinton supporters will fight back in the same terms, the Democratic Party is likely to spend the next four years fighting itself rather than Trump, trying to exclude its own members in the same way Trump supporters want to get rid of everyone they don’t like. The Republicans have the same problem. Trump was as offensive to his intra-party opponents as he was to Clinton. Those who think themselves “real” Republicans will be emboldened by the pro-Sanders Democrats to seek to reclaim the party and its voters from the Trump constituency in the same way. This will generate more exclusion and counter-exclusion, even through Republican Congress versus Republican President battles, with each trying to show themselves to the public as More Republican Than Thou. Both Trump and Sanders supporters will now feel that they are the new “Establishment” because they have been backed by their respective publics to overthrow the old one. Though both Trump and Sanders were the none-of-the-above candidates, they will be the above from now on. To justify their initial behaviour, and satisfy their support, they will have to be even worse Establishments than the ones they have removed, more intolerant, more exclusive …more arbitrary. If the old guard is going to come back, they will have no choice but to adopt the same tactics. The choice at the next election will be between groups of battle-hardened intolerants who are more interested in serving their friends and stuffing their enemies than in the disaffected people in their midst. Trump has not overthrown the failed political Establishment and methods which created the disaffection he has exploited, he has confirmed their validity. Trump may change the personnel, but the Establishment will be the same animal, all the more dangerous for its delusions to the contrary.

       " ['US Media Weaponizes “Economic Outlooks” | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Thailand Thailand is currently undergoing a sensitive period with the passing of the nation’s long-lived, revered head of state, King Bhumibol Adulyadej . Indeed, the mood across the country is somber, however, the actual business of the nation continues on with many Thais realizing that moving forward is the best way to honor their late king. And despite Thais continuing to work, factories continuing to produce, agricultural goods continuing to be cultivated, processed, and shipped domestically, regionally, and internationally, the Western media – driven by corporate-financier and political special interests – has attempted to upend confidence in the Thai economy by suggesting that somehow toned-down entertainment venues will overturn the entire economy. And some in the Western media have attempted to claim the one year of official mourning in Thailand could even affect the rest of Asia. But back in reality, sound economic fundamentals and actual political stability determine a nation’s positive economic outlook – and Thailand possesses both. The Financial Times in an article titled, “Can Thailand’s economy handle a year of mourning?,” claims that: Many Thais are putting off weddings, vacations and other “joyful events” as the country begins a one-year period of mourning. This is in addition to a 30-day ban on “entertainment” that has forced infamous bar districts, like Bangkok’s Soi Cowboy, to pull down their shutters out of respect for the late king. Although some bars have resumed operations with workers dressed all in black, the nighttime landscape of the capital remains dramatically quiet. Even after the entertainment ban is lifted, it is hard to say how quickly the nation’s mood will bounce back. While Thailand is noted for its tourist and entertainment venues, they contribute a relatively small percentage (9-16% of GDP) to Thailand’s overall economic activity. Most tourist destinations in Thailand continue to operate as normal. And while the nation’s more infamous entertainment industry is indeed expected to see a downturn, the total number of people employed by it represents at most, only 0.5% of the nation’s total workforce. Attempts to claim that the year of mourning may lead to political instability are also questionable. The king’s heir and his decision to postpone ascending to the throne until the end of the mourning period next year is in fact a sign of confidence that the nation can safely mourn, without rushing the succession process. If political stability in Thailand is compromised, it will be because of external forces. The nation’s political opposition are a spent force, and US attempts to stir up division and chaos by intensifying violence in the nation’s deep south have so far been unsuccessful. Both the opposition and prospects of violence in the south expanding depend entirely on the US’ ability to support them both – and both Thais and foreign observers alike have become increasingly adept at exposing this foreign support. Weaponizing Economic Outlooks The Financial Times is not the only Western media source attempting to portray Thailand as looking into an economic abyss. The entirety of the Western media has also attempted to perpetuate this narrative, not because careful analysis has helped them arrive at this conclusion, but because of a concerted effort to use Thailand’s moment of perceived sociopolitical weakness to undermine the current political order and help return to power Western-backed political parties – more specifically – those allied to ousted ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The “weaponizing” of economic outlooks has long been employed by the Western media. Portraying a nation’s economy as faltering helps spread panic across fickle investors, encouraging them to invest elsewhere and drawing away much needed capital to sustain economic growth. However, despite this, Asia finds itself in a position where the majority of its economic activity is done regionally. What Western papers and news channels say is increasingly irrelevant to the plans and ambitions of these regional players. As for Thailand’s economy in particular, the current government is on track, repairing the agricultural industry after gross mismanagement by Shinawatra’s administration, including a devastated rice industry. It is also investing in the increased use of technology and innovation across all sectors of the economy. Beyond that, Thailand still serves as an attractive nation for companies to build and operate factories, and Thailand itself sees its own domestic industry maturing and increasingly exporting goods of their own abroad. Agriculture, industry, energy, education, and service industries – which employ the vast majority of Thais – have basic fundamentals that will remain unaffected by the nation’s year of mourning. The superficial examples the Western media cites are cited specifically to prey on the ignorance and misconceptions their ill-informed audiences have regarding Thailand and its economy.

       "  'You Are Here: Home » Latest Posts » Anxiety and Worry Increase Risk of Heart Disease Anxiety and Worry Increase Risk of Heart Disease Prev post Next post \\nby Ana Sandoiu – MNT \\nAnxiety is a serious health concern affecting a large part of the American population. Now, new research indicates that health anxiety might increase the risk of heart disease. \\nHealth anxiety might increase the risk of heart disease, research finds. In the United States, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness, affecting 40 million adults, or 18 percent of the population. \\nAnxiety is a known risk factor for heart disease . Previous research indicates a connection between depression and anxiety and the risk of coronary heart disease . \\nA meta-analysis found that anxious people have a 48 percent higher risk of dying from a heart problem. \\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death among Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), killing 365,000 people in 2014. New research suggests that the consequences of health anxiety are also serious and the condition should be treated properly. \\nHealth anxiety describes a patient’s excessive worrying over having a serious illness, and seeking medical advice in the absence of a physical disease. \\nPatients with health anxiety misread physical symptoms as serious illnesses, and they often seek repeated medical help for the same issues. In its most intense form, health anxiety becomes hypochondria . Health anxiety and heart disease \\nResearchers led by Line Iden Berge, from the Helse Bergen hospital in Bergen, Norway, examined the link between health anxiety and heart disease. The results were published in the online journal BMJ Open . \\nBerge and team worked with participants in the Norwegian Hordaland Health Study (HUSK). This long-term study followed participants over a period of 12 years, and it was a collaboration between the National Health Screening Service, the University of Bergen, and local health services. \\nThe 7,052 participants were born between 1953-1957. For the study, they had to answer questions about their health, lifestyle, and educational achievement. \\nBetween 1997-1999, they underwent blood tests, weight, height, and blood pressure measurements. Participants were also asked to report their anxiety levels using the Whiteley Index. Scores above 90 percent were considered to be anxiety cases. \\nOver the entire study period, 234 participants, or 3.2 percent of the entire cohort, had an ischemic incident – either a heart attack or acute angina . Health anxiety raised heart disease risk by 73 percent \\nDuring follow-up, twice as many participants with health anxiety developed heart disease, compared with those who did not report any anxiety. Around 6.1 percent of health anxiety cases developed ischemic heart disease (IHD), compared with 3 percent of non-cases. \\nBecause participants had been enrolled in a nationwide research project monitoring heart disease, their heart health was monitored extensively. The national program, entitled “Cardiovascular diseases in Norway,” was carried out between 1994-2009, so the study could track participants using national hospital data and death certificates up to 2009. \\nAfter adjustments for established cardiovascular risk factors, researchers found a 73 percent increased risk of developing IHD among cases with health anxiety. \\nEven considering established risk factors for IHD, such as smoking, high cholesterol , and education, health anxiety was a high risk factor for IHD. The risk of IHD also increased proportionally with the level of reported anxiety; the stronger the symptoms of health anxiety, the higher the risk of IHD. \\nRegarding gender, a very slight increase in IHD risk was noticed in women with health anxiety over their male counterparts. Trust your heart \\nCaveats to the results of the study include the fact that this is an observational study, telling us little about the cause-and-effect relation between anxiety and IHD. \\nAlso, health anxiety is often associated with other mental health issues, such as general anxiety and depression, so the different types of anxiety and ways in which they increase the risk of heart disease can be difficult to differentiate. “[Our study] further indicates that characteristic behavior among persons with health anxiety, such as monitoring and frequent check-ups of symptoms, does not reduce the risk of [coronary heart disease] events,” the researchers write. \\nOn the contrary, keeping the body in a constant state of alert might further increase the risk of heart-related incidents. \\nThis puts both patients with anxiety and doctors in a difficult position. Telling an anxious patient that their anxiety is not a symptom of heart disease might help, but on the other hand, informing them that health anxiety might induce heart disease over time could cause them even more anxiety. 5 Herbs That Relieve Anxiety \\nNervousness, difficulty in sleeping, depression and fearfulness can be symptoms of an anxiety disorder.

       "  'Tweet \\nINDIANAPOLIS, IN – An infectious diseases clinic is thinking outside the box in an effort to promote safe sex practices by passing out free chastity belts to their clinic patients and anyone who strolls into their clinic and simply asks for one. Their slogan is “Chas-T-D, yes… S-T-D, no!” \\n“If there’s one barrier more sturdy than a condom or a diaphragm , it has to be this,” said infectious diseases physician Mark Rappaport. He pulls back his white coat to demonstrate his iron chastity belt, which he’s wearing over his work pants. He knocks his knuckles against it a few times, causing a hard metallic clank to resonate. “Good luck trying to get me infected, STDs.” \\n“Remember that scene in Robin Hood’s Men in Tights where Robin Hood clanks his junk against Princess Marian’s chastity belt?” asked one of Rappaport’s patients Ariana Manning. “Sure, that scene is funny when you watch it, but it really makes you think. So I thought about it and I can’t wait to put this thing on. Safety first, right?” \\nRappaport’s clinic teamed up with local welders to create thousands of sturdy chastity belts. Not only will the clinic offer these chastity belts and STD counseling for free, they will help any patients put their belt on and happily throw away the key to ensure lifelong abstinence. \\n“Urinating and defecating is a bit messy, but you get used to it,” admits Rappaport, blushing a bit. “That’s why I always have some Handi Wipes on me. For the leakage. There’s always some leakage.” He added later: “On the other hand, you never have to worry about any cheap shots to the nuts .” \\nDepending on the success of their program, Rappaport’s clinic may start customizing chastity belts for more widespread dissemination. “People like options, colors,” explained Manning. “If you were to tell me I could get a personalized chastity belt in rose gold so that it matches my iPhone and has my name on it, I’d be in heaven.” 146 Shares '],\n",

       " ['Major Russian Geopolitical Moves Going Unnoticed in Wake of US Election | The Vineyard of the Saker',\n",
       "  '424 Views November 17, 2016 No Comments Guest Posts The Saker \\nby Oleg Maslov \\nIt’s official, Russia has decided to grab the bull by the horns. Just one week after the shocking vote in the US presidential election resulted in a Trump victory, Russia has decided to pull all the stops and take care of some long lingering business while Obama’s administration is working overtime to manage a transition that no one expected would happen and Obama himself is out of the office, making what might be his very last visit to Europe, calming the closest of American allies in a time of serious questions about the future of the American relationship with NATO. \\nObama has just two months before Trump will be sworn in and much of the time and energy of his staff will be consumed by briefing Trump and his cabinet, which is not yet fully formed, on their duties and on the situation in the world in general. Perhaps Obama’s own transition team will try to convince the Teflon Don and his staff to pursue a similar policy on many issues, not the least of which include Obamacare and the Paris agreement on climate change. Trump himself has already received a call from Putin shortly after the election, one of Trump’s most publicized calls with world leaders after news of his victory broke, putting even more pressure on Obama’s transition team to get their points across quickly. \\nIn the meantime, Obama is making his last expected tour of Europe before Trump’s inauguration. It is not certain exactly why Obama chose to visit Greece first, but it is certainly significant that he was greeted with tens of thousands of protesters, in the least because it shows the current zeitgeist. Obama has to perform his duties of Salesman in Chief as he goes around to NATO allies and reassures them of budget commitments to American forces stationed abroad. I can only imagine the brain-tingling questions that Obama will have to field from the German and French defense ministers. \\nThe main source of all the sweating European bureaucrats is Trump’s apparent friendliness with Russia and criticism of NATO, which could mean that Brussels will have to have some existential discussions on many long standing policies, including the sanctions against Russia. In fact, if Trump were to recognize Crimea as a legal part of Russia, as he has suggested that he is willing to do, Europe may either have to follow suit and bring down the house of cards commonly referred to as the Ukrainian Crisis or declare an open break with Washington’s foreign policy, a veritable checkmate. \\nIf the current batch of Eurocrats were to keep their jobs (which is looking questionable), they would most probably try to avoid an open break with Washington or, ironically, risk losing their jobs. An open break with Washington would set the European Union into open waters of foreign policy sovereignty, a move that would meet with great resistance from many sources. Either way, an incredible shake-up is coming to Ukraine soon as they are about to have much less friends in the ‘international community’. \\nHowever, all of these major theatrical dramas and loud, painful snowflake whines are actually working wonderfully to divert attention from the real news. This last Monday night, Russia did several noteworthy things on a globally relevant geopolitical level that will surely resonate with the global movers and shakers. Russia launched an all-out air assault onto ‘Syrian rebels’ operating in the Homs, Idlib, and Latakia provinces of Syria. Monday night’s military campaign coincided with the biggest corruption bust in the history of modern Russia – the Russian Economy Minister Ulyukaev was taken into custody by the FSB after being caught demanding and accepting a $2 million bribe. Lastly, and perhaps less significantly but just as suddenly and symbolically, Russia has announced that it will no longer participate in the International Criminal Court. \\nHowever, in the humble opinion of this author, the most important fact to note connecting these three events is that they represent huge milestones in the modern history of Russia. One event is on the domestic political and economic level, connecting staff thought to be within the inner circle of the Kremlin specifically with financial corruption. The second is purely military in nature and works to show off the power projection capabilities of the modern Russian military. Thirdly, Russia’s decision to leave the ICC is a huge signal to Russia’s positions in the context of international bodies, up to and including the UN. \\nI would like to highlight this point just one more time to make sure that the meaning doesn’t slide by anyone. The government of Russia has just performed the biggest government shake up since the fall of the Soviet Union, with the FSB arresting the ‘untouchable’ Economy Minister from his post and placing him on a very public trial for extorting a very large bribe. Russia have also launched the biggest attack on an enemy military at least since the Second Chechen conflict, which was the major event of the first few years of Putin’s presidency over 17 years ago, and, at most, since Soviet forces left Afghanistan in 1989, 27 years ago. And lastly, Russia has made a very major and unexpected decision to abandon the jurisdictions of the ICC, long known for its adherence to justice and fair verdicts (sarcasm). AT NEARLY EXACTLY THE SAME TIME! \\nIs it just me, or does it seem like the planets are aligning here? \\nLet’s analyze the first event. Alexei Ulyukaev was accused of extorting a bribe from state-owned oil company Rosneft to tune of $2 million, cold hard cash, and was arrested by investigators (mostly three letter agencies) at night. To top it all off, one official said under condition of anonymity that Ulyukaev’s arrest was the final act in a yearlong investigation by the FSB. Ulyukaev, a member of the Russian government since the break-up of the Soviet Union, has been considered as member of Russia’s liberal, Western-leaning politicians. Of particular interest is Ulyukaev’s CV. \\nUlyukaev has held some critical positions in the modern Russian government, including serving under Gaidar and managing the shock privatizations of Soviet assets (as well as the shock hyperinflation) from 1991-1994. He was a deputy to Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin from 2000-2004 before taking a job as the first vice-chairman of the Russian Central Bank, a position that he held from April 2004 to June 2013. When he was arrested, again, in the middle of the night, he was the acting Economy Minister. \\nUlyukaev was certainly high on the list of those considered to be untouchable. \\nAlong with Ulyukaev, the vice-governor of Saint Petersburg and some high-ranking officials in the regional government of the Kemerovo region have also been arrested for corruption after investigations by the FSB. \\nVarious commentary has already surfaced claiming that Putin has turned to the age old Russian tradition of the Purge. Opinion leaders in the community are writing that no ‘chinovnik’ or oligarch could feel that ‘untouchable’ anymore after Ulyukaev’s arrest and that corrupt officials better behave or face the ax. Still others are claiming that Putin is consolidating his power and is preparing to become a dictator in the classic sense. No matter which explanation you prefer, the fact remains that the Russian government is powerfully expressing its political and economic sovereignty and is publicly making a loud statement against corruption. \\nThe second incident was a comprehensive and simultaneous assault on rebel targets all over Syria in a very short time frame. Targets were struck with a bevy of missiles launched both from sea and by land. One of the most surprising features of this massive campaign is the sheer size and diversity of it. The Bastion system, highlighted as a defensive surface-to-surface missile system, showed off its potent attack power, engaging targets up to 300 miles away. \\nIHS Janes reports on the news that Russia is “not known to have previously claimed” that the Bastion, which is originally an anti-ship missile, “has a land attack capability”. It turns out that missile ‘defense’ systems designed to engage land targets, such as the United States Missile Defense systems in Poland and Romania, can easily be used to engage in attacks on land targets. Surprise, surprise. \\nHowever, the brunt of the missile strikes done by Kalibr missiles launched from the Mediterranean Sea, most notably from Russia’s new and improved frigate, the Admiral Grigorovich. In fact, the Russian naval group, led by the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, made ‘waves’ in Europe as the group was headed to their final destination, the Syrian coast, from which they launched volley after volley of high precision cruise missiles at targets from what is most likely a confusing medley of rebel groups. It is highly likely that, among the rebel groups which met the explosive end of a Russian cruise missile, some were directly funded by American allies, and less likely that the Russians even targeted groups directly trained or supplied by the CIA. \\nThis major military move actually kills two birds with one stone. First, it provides Russia’s allies and ‘partners’ in the area with a bit of information about how far and in what quantity the Russian military can project its power. Further, it reveals that the Russians are most likely purposefully understating the power and capabilities of many of their newest technologies (although this should come as a surprise to no one). Also to this point, the Russian government did not ask permission of any international body when it passed through international waters and made its way to Syria, despite the ‘uncomfort’ felt in London. The second stone is that Russia has engaged in one of the most effective and convincing advertising campaigns for their newest export model military products. With loud fanfare, the Russians showed the world that Russian arms still give great bang for the buck. \\nThe last major move, but, in the view of this author, not nearly as significant as the other two, is Russia’s decision to withdraw its signature from the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court. This move was sudden and symbolic, coming after the ICC ruled Russia’s ‘annexation’ Crimea illegal and called the current situation an ‘occupation’, but will lead to no noticeable change in real terms, since Russia never actually ratified the Rome Statute, meaning that it never submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the ICC to begin with. \\nOne can write more on the nature and meaning of the withdrawal of Russia from the ICC, but the readers are welcome to find their own facts and form their own opinions. I will also stop short of giving my opinion on this strange set of geopolitical ‘coincidences’, and finish only with a invitation for speculation on what these facts could mean for the future of Russia, Russia’s relationship with Europe and the world, and the global security structure as a whole.

       " ['Monsieur Malbrough est Mort | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Europe A recently published article titled with the words of a popular French song “ Marlbrough s’en va-t-en Guerre ” has attracted much attention around the background of Francois Hollande’s “achievements” Now that Donald Trump has been elected as the next President of the United States, a string of European politicians have started voicing their discontent, including the current French President. He has failed to hide such discontent with the decision Americans have made. However, he described Trump’s victory as a “lesson learnt,” the importance of which “goes far beyond the borders of the United States.” Little did he know, French politicians have interpreted this passage in their own reserved way. On November 10, the lower house of the Assemblée nationale has passed the vote to impeach Hollande, passing the bill with 152 votes out of the total of 199, resulting in the president of the Assemblée Nationale, Claude Bartolone, officially submitting a draft resolution for Hollande’s impeachment. The impeachment procedure has only been introduced in 2014 in accordance with Article 68 of the French Constitution. According to the laws of the Fifth Republic, a president can only be impeached if he blatantly ignored his duties. To start this procedure, one would have to obtain 58 votes in the Assemblée Nationale, where the Republicans are now holding a total of 193 seats. The demand for Hollande to leave was signed by a total 152 deputies, including the Republican Spokesperson in the Assembly, Christian Jacob and the former Prime-Minister Fran ç ois Fillon. The Right are convinced that Hollande should be held liable for disclosing state secrets in his book with the telling title “ A President Shouldn’t Say This “ (U n pr é sident ne devrait pas dire ç a …). They are convinced that a president should know better than putting down all the details of French secret service operations aimed at assassinating terrorist leaders abroad. If the draft is to be found valid, it will be handed over to a special judicial committee of the the lower house of the the Assemblée Nationale. Finally, when everything is said and done, the two houses will form the Republican High Court that will decide the fate of the sitting president. But regardless of how the impeachment procedure turns out in the end, this whole affairs has literally ended Hollande’s political career, since he has no chance to get reelected. Therefore, one could use the words of the above mentioned song : « Monsieur Malbrough est mort » ( Malbrough is now dead ). However, this wasn’t much of a surprise for anyone who has been following French politics, since, according to Le Figaro , Hollande’s approval rating has hit an all time low of 11%. No President in French history enjoyed less support from the population, with even the Socialist party reluctant to back up Hollande’s policies, with only 34% supporting him. However, it seems unlikely that Hollande will be the only European leader that will have to face the consequences of his mindless support of US President Obama’s warmongering policies that have, at the end of the day, inflicted serious damage to EU interests.

       " ['Donald Trump and the Equilibrium to Come | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World The news these last few days has been all about the radical left being up in arms over Donald Trump’s ascendency to the US Presidency. The massive upset victory of this charismatic non-politician is crystallizing into a very divisive situation in the United States and in Europe, as EU leaders and NATO nations paint a geo-political picture of gloom and doom for us. However negative the picture may seem though, the shiny side of this leadership coin shows a glowing promise. Here’s my take on what is about to happen when Donald Trump is inaugurated. Donald Trump did not win this election on any of the bases which Clinton’s supporters profess. This is crucial to accept if we are to understand what is about to happen. Trump is not a bigot, a racist, nor is he some misogynistic woman hater. Trump is a product of both American progress and to an extend hyper-capitalism. His “locker room” talk resonates no more resoundingly than his anti-establishment diatribe against the Washington elites. For those who have watched him over the years, it is so clear the man just says what he thinks at the moment. He said he would “drain the swamp” of politically corrupt in Washington, and I think he is about to. He also said , if he was elected, he would install a special prosecutor to investigate and indict Hillary Clinton for her part in illegal activities. Those out there demonstrating do not fully understand “who” it is there are demonstrating on behalf of, nor do they understand the breadth of criminality and malfeasance Mr. Trump has suggested. WikiLeaks opened the investigation to the court of public opinion, and this is why Donald Trump is the President-elect now. I could enumerate the multiple statutes Mrs. Clinton breached while she was Secretary of State, but her alleged crimes and misdemeanors against the United States are not the reason the Democrats lost. I could list the multitude of lies the Podesta emails proved, and how Hillary Clinton told Congress, the media, the FBI, and the atmosphere of crooked dealings she and the Democrats created, but the American people did not shun her for lying to them either. Politicians lie like water flows with gravity. The American people voted for Donald Trump because the system in place the last 25 years failed them. There’s no need for a history lesson in order for me to prove my contention here. When George Herbert Walker Bush met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev just after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the people of the world drew in a deep breath of possibility and potential. The promise was further illuminated in 1991, but the fall of the Soviet Union that was supposed to set free all the peoples of all the nations, it was never the plan. Almost simultaneously with his handshake with Gorbachev, Bush and his backers were steeled for the first invasion of Iraq. Bush’s part in lighting the fuse on today’s destabilization bomb was not his greatest betrayal of the American people though. Not many political analysts these days talk about George H.W. Bush’s role in NAFTA, but step toward globalism ruined a hundred million lives and the dreams attached to them within a few short years. NAFTA, later set in place by Bill Clinton, destroyed the United States as a manufacturing power. Not only did millions lose their jobs, the globalization strategies keyed to NAFTA would later cause the global economic and military conflicts we see right now. An easy way of seeing this is by watching the march of NATO across Eastern Europe toward the doorstep of Russia. I can show you how Bill Clinton’s administration got Yugoslavia out of the US hegemony’s way. Clinton left office as one of only two US Presidents to have been through impeachment proceedings, and after having paved the way to the coming Iraq invasion. Showing the collusion in between Clinton’s successor George W. Bush, Britain’s Tony Blair, and Europe’s leadership in what became known as the “Bush Doctrine”, which amounted to “Democratic regime change”. The Afghanistan War, the war and occupation of Iraq, the later Georgian War, Barack Obama’s part in Ukraine, then Arab Spring, Gaddafi, Assad and Syria, the spread of this quasi-democratic movement is well documented by the trail of blood and misery left in its path. Whether the reader wishes to see the march of these successive administrations as complicit or circumstantial participants in this is irrelevant. In the long view the United States’ domestic and global policies have failed billions of people. Furthermore, on some individual level, each and every one of us has felt these failures. This is true of the protesters from Austin to Washington today. These Hillary supporters are by and large, just the pawns of the globalists who pay for play via the US Treasury, and who now fund the very upheaval against President-elect Trump. The Hillary Clinton “upset” is a far bigger paradigm than anyone is telling us. At this point some readers are already asking; “So where is that glowing promise?” Donald Trump is in the process of emptying not only the “Washington swamp”, but the European one as well. Before you object, please consider what it means for a powerful outsider to enter this game of crisis-détente. Look at how EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expressing the panic of European leadership in this comment this week: “We will need to teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works.” News that NATO is losing it over the Trump presidency is brought into context if we look at how NATO is trying to establish Moscow as the bitter foe again. I recall something Mr. Putin said to the Valdai Conference in Sochi in 2014, when announced; “Playtime is over”. The Russian president was talking about backroom deals and underhanded dealings geo-policy makers had been engaging in for decades, and how he was not engaging in them any longer. This is vital for understanding Mr. Trump’s position with regard to positivity toward Russia and China. The globalists who have run this show for decades are now faced with powerful opponents to their plans. All of this is irrefutable, and only the minute details remain to be seen. The worst nightmare of the billionaires who have benefited from world chaos is now elected. Imagine now what will come out in a Hillary Clinton investigation without the Obama Department of Justice to block! Donald Trump has at his fingertips every underhanded shift, every bit of NSA intelligence, every USAID or CIA penny shoveled to ISIL, or to some unscrupulous EU official. Hillary and Bill Clinton, the Bushs, Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Tony Blair, Cameron, billionaires like George Soros and his NGOs, the whole grimy and messy swamp of leadership corruption is now in the hands of a guy who builds skyscrapers and golf courses. Somebody outside the “club” is in the White House and nobody knows what he is going to do. No Rockefeller millions put him there. No Soros funding promoted him, and no corporate media voiced a kind word about him. The opposition to Donald Trump did every dirty, stinking, rotten deed they could to ensure he lost, but fed up America said “no”. The world’s geo-political reptiles are losing their collective minds today. Soros and MoveOn.org, the neo-socialists marching in Berlin are organizing a popular uprising, but the Trump power base is more firm. The same frustrated American that lost his manufacturing job and pension to NAFTA, he is the neighbor of that redneck veteran Obama sent to lose in Afghanistan. The shining hope I speak of is in the pragmatic realism of Trump, Putin, and any leader compelled to actually serve a people. Here is how I see it playing out. As I looked at Vladimir Putin’s Instagram account today, I could not help but notice he and former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi walking side-by-side in the woods. The reason I mention this is because the media in the west has already jumped on a fear, and a meme, in comparing Berlusconi to Trump. One of Mr. Putin’s friends, Berlusconi is a fascinating and powerful ally in Italy, a nation increasingly reticent on Germany’s and America’s control of Europe. The neo-fascist liberals who were so “all in” to get Clinton elected, now they are in chaotic disarray now over politicians like Matteo Renzi, whom Berlusconi backs. To cut short here, the Trump-Putin cohesion the far-left tried to use against the billionaire property mogul, is the same bright potential that can rescue the planet. Europe is only an extension of Washington, London, Berlin, and Paris these days, and the EU that never was has scores of nations restless for change. Trump is the catalyst for this change whether he choose to try Hillary Clinton or not. You see Trump is a businessman first, and philosopher poet last. The bottom line here is, peace with Russia and carry on business, or stand trial for betraying a billion people. These protests, the NATO and EU “warnings” to Trump, these indications tell me just how corrupt this system was.

       " ['American Dream, Revisited',\n",
       "  'Pepe ESCOBAR | 30.10.2016 | OPINION American Dream, Revisited Will Trump pull a Brexit times ten? What would it take, beyond WikiLeaks, to bring the Clinton (cash) machine down? Will Hillary win and then declare WWIII against her Russia / Iran / Syria «axis of evil»? Will the Middle East totally explode? Will the pivot to Asia totally implode? Will China be ruling the world by 2025? Amidst so many frenetic fragments of geopolitical reality precariously shored against our ruins, the temptation is irresistible to hark back to the late, great, deconstructionist master Jean Baudrillard. During the post-mod 1980s it was hip to be Baudrillardian to the core; his America, originally published in France in 1986, should still be read today as the definitive metaphysical/geological/cultural Instagram of Exceptionalistan. By the late 1990s, at the end of the millennium, two years before 9/11 – that seminal «before and after» event - Baudrillard was already stressing how we live in a black market maze. Now, it’s a black market paroxysm. Global multitudes are subjected to a black market of work – as in the deregulation of the official market; a black market of unemployment; a black market of financial speculation; a black market of misery and poverty; a black market of sex (as in prostitution); a black market of information (as in espionage and shadow wars); a black market of weapons; and even a black market of thinking. Way beyond the late 20 th century, in the 2010s what the West praises as «liberal democracy» – actually a neoliberal diktat - has virtually absorbed every ideological divergence, while leaving behind a heap of differences floating in some sort of trompe l’oeil effect. What’s left is a widespread, noxious condition; the pre-emptive prohibition of any critical thought, which has no way to express itself other than becoming clandestine (or finding the right internet niche). Baudrillard already knew that the concept of «alter» - killed by conviviality - does not exist in the official market. So an «alter» black market also sprung up, co-opted by traffickers; that’s, for instance, the realm of racism, nativism and other forms of exclusion. Baudrillard already identified how a «contraband alter», expressed by sects and every form of nationalism (nowadays, think about the spectrum between jihadism and extreme-right wing political parties) was bound to become more virulent in a society that is desperately intolerant, obsessed with regimentation, and totally homogenized. There could be so much exhilaration inbuilt in life lived in a bewildering chimera cocktail of cultures, signs, differences and «values»; but then came the coupling of thinking with its exact IT replica – artificial intelligence, playing with the line of demarcation between human and non-human in the domain of thought. The result, previewed by Baudrillard, was the secretion of a parapolitical society - with a sort of mafia controlling this secret form of generalized corruption (think the financial Masters of the Universe). Power is unable to fight this mafia - and that would be, on top of it, hypocritical, because the mafia itself emanates from power. The end result is that what really matters today, anywhere, mostly tends to happen outside all official circuits; like in a social black market. Is there any information «truth»? Baudrillard showed how political economy is a massive machine, producing value, producing signs of wealth, but not wealth itself. The whole media / information system – still ruled by America - is a massive machine producing events as signs; exchangeable value in the universal market of ideology, the star system and catastrophism. This abstraction of information works as in the economy – disgorging a coded material, deciphered in advance, and negotiable in terms of models, as much as the economy disgorges products negotiable in terms of price and value. Since all merchandise, thanks to this abstraction of value, is exchangeable, then every event (or non-event) is also exchangeable, all replacing one another in the cultural market of information. And that takes us to where we live now; Trans-History, and Trans-Politics – where events have really not happened, as they get lost in the vacuum of information (as much as the economy gets lost in the vacuum of speculation). Thus this quintessential Baudrillard insight; if we consider History as a movie – and that’s what it is now – then the «truth» of information is no more than post-production synch, dubbing and subtitles. Still, as we all keep an intense desire for devouring events, there is immense disappointment as well, because the content of information is desperately inferior to the means of broadcasting them. Call it a pathetic, universal contagion; people don’t know what to do about their sadness or enthusiasm – in parallel to our societies becoming theaters of the absurd where nothing has consequences. No acts, deeds, crimes (the 2008 financial crisis), political events (the WikiLeaks emails showing virtually no distinction between the «nonprofit» Clinton cash machine, what’s private and what’s public, the obsessive pursuit of personal wealth, and the affairs of the state) seem to have real consequences. Immunity, impunity, corruption, speculation - we veer towards a state of zero responsibility (think Goldman Sachs). So, automatically, we yearn for an event of maximum consequence, a «fatal» event to repair that scandalous non-equivalence. Like a symbolic re-equilibrium of the scales of destiny. So we dream of an amazing event – Trump winning the election? Hillary declaring WWIII? - that would free us from the tyranny of meaning and the constraint of always searching for the equivalence between effects and causes. Shadowing the world Just like Baudrillard, I got to see «deep» America in the 1980s and 1990s by driving across America. So sooner or later one develops a metaphysical relationship with that ubiquitous warning, «Objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear». But what if they may also be further than they appear? The contemporary instant event/celebrity culture deluge of images upon us; does it get us closer to a so-called «real» world that is in fact very far away from us? Or does it in fact keep the world at a distance – creating an artificial depth of field that protects us from the imminence of objects and the virtual danger they represent? In parallel, we keep slouching towards a single future language – the language of algorithms, as designed across the Wall Street / Silicon Valley axis – that would represent a real anthropological catastrophe, just like the globalist/New World Order dream of One Thought and One Culture. Languages are multiple and singular – by definition. If there were a single language, words would become univocal, regulating themselves in an autopilot of meaning. There would be no interplay – as in artificial languages there’s no interplay. Language would be just the meek appendix of a unified reality – the negative destiny of a languidly unified human species. That’s where the American «dream» seems to be heading. It’s time to take the next exit ramp. '],\n",

Officer Justin Martin and Sargent Tony Beminio were found shot and killed 20 minutes apart, Wednesday morning. Per authorities, Greene ambushed both Martin and Beminio while in their police cruisers, at two separate locations. Ambush-style shootings on police officers have been a common story on local and national news outlets.\\nOn July 17, Gaven Long took the lives of three Baton Rouge police officers. His motives were uncertain but his anger toward white police officials was clear. Recordings of Long ranting and raving about racial injustice surfaced on social media websites days prior to the shootings. Also, Long wore a self-made body camera and visited Dallas, where five officers were killed less than two weeks before his own rampage. There is no physical connection between Long and the Dallas shooter, their mental states were similar.\\nMicah Xavier Johnson, who fatally shot five Dallas officers, believed racial injustice was out of control. Despite his feelings toward police and the black community, Johnson’s stepmother was white and he was not known to “pick particular sides with race.” Johnson was killed by police officers who used a bomb-wearing robot, following the shootings. This left his motivation for the shootings a mystery. Not all police ambushes are incited by racial discrimination.\\nOn Sept. 12, 2014, Eric Frein opened fire on the Blooming Grove state police barracks, in Pennsylvania. One officer died and another was severely wounded. U.S. Marshals would later find Frein, 50 days later, in an airport hangar. He was discovered 23 miles from the barracks. Frein had expressed anger toward law enforcement but the reason for his anger has not been understood.

       " ['The Eurasian Economic Union – a New Power in the Asia-Pacific Region | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Asian-Pacific region The Free Trade Zone Agreement between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) came into effect on October 5, 2016. It was signed by the heads of the governments of the SRV and all the EAEU Member States – Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Russia in May 2015, but it could only come into effect after its ratification by the Parliaments of the countries listed above. The EAEU has been trading actively with Vietnam for many years. Over the period from 2010 to 2014, the trade volume increased by more than 60%, exceeding $4 billion. The establishment of the free trade zone is a logical step in this cooperation. According to the Eurasian Commission’s forecasts, it may lead to more than a twofold growth in trade turnover by 2020, and Russia will enjoy no less than 80% thereof. The total population of the EAEU is 183 million people and the total GDP exceeds $2 trillion. Privileged access to such an extensive market is surely a boon to Vietnam’s economy. The EAEU also stands to make gains: SRV’s population exceeds 95 million people and its GDP amounts to $192 billion. According to data gathered in recent years, the country’s economy is rapidly developing. Thus, the Free Trade Zone Agreement is advantageous for both parties. According to the document, most goods from both the SRV and the EAEU are subject to complete or partial exemption from import duty for the next ten years. This should lead to a reduction in their cost and rapid trade development. In addition, the Agreement also focuses on intellectual property protection, cooperation in e-commerce and in public procurement. It also covers competition protection. Alongside imports and exports, the Free Trade Zone Agreement will facilitate mutual investment. Vietnam’s leadership sees a lot of potential in the trade partnership with both the EAEU and Russia in particular. According to data as of 2016, Russian-Vietnamese trade turnover amounted to $3.7 billion. Owing to the establishment of Free Trade Zone, it is expected to exceed $10 billion by 2020. Alongside the provisions that are common to all the Members States, the Free Trade Zone Agreement primarily included sections related only to the SRV and Russia. They specify additional terms and conditions, which facilitate trade, investment, and the movement of individuals between the two countries. After the Agreement was signed, the Russian-Vietnamese “Intergovernmental Protocol on supporting motor vehicle production in the territory of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam” came into effect. This document was signed in March 2016 by Vietnam’s Minister of Industry and Trade Vũ Huy Hoàng during a visit to Russia. D. Manturov, the Russian Minister of Industry and Trade, signed the Protocol on behalf of Russia. According to the document, joint ventures will be established in the SRV between Vietnamese firms and Russian companies such as the GAZ Group, KamAZ, Sollers, which will produce various types of automotive vehicles. Concluding the Free Trade Zone Agreement with Vietnam is beneficial to the EAEU and Russia in particular. However, its significance is greater than simply gaining a good trade partner. It may be posited that the Russian economy has reached a new level: Russia has not had such agreements with countries outside the former Soviet Union before. Furthermore, this is the beginning of the large-scale promotion of the EAEU and Russia in the Asia-Pacific Region. Since the EAEU’s inception in 2015, it has been trying to establish trade relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific Region. It is well-known that Vietnam is an important member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which unites a number of states in the Asia-Pacific Region. It is quite probable that the free trade zone with Vietnam is a step towards establishing free trade zone will all other Member States of the ASEAN. Many ASEAN Members are favourably disposed towards this idea. Negotiations are being held with Indonesia, the Kingdom of Cambodia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Furthermore, the possibility of establishing free trade zones with non-ASEAN states in the Asia-Pacific Region, such as India, China, and New Zealand is under consideration. Thus, it can be said that the EAEU’s position in the Asia-Pacific Region is gradually strengthening. This was also confirmed by Mongolia’s statement in November 2016 on its desire to join the EAEU. At first glance, it may seem that the EAEU’s presence in the Asia-Pacific Region will lead to the competition with China, now one of the major players in the region amid the weakening position of the USA. In fact, the growing influence of the EAEU is more profitable for China. It is well known that the opposition between China and the USA currently dominates the Asia-Pacific Region. America’s economic and political influence in the region has weakened considerably in recent years, but it is still great. America is trying to maintain its power as much as it can and win over as many countries as possible. For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement was signed in February 2016. The TPP includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the USA, and Vietnam. All these states are united by a free trade zone and a number of common rules. It is undoubtedly difficult to compete with such a union as about 30% of global trade is undertaken by TPP Member States. Moreover, negotiations are under way regarding the creation of the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The USA hopes to attract the European Union’s involvement. The probability that these negotiations will be successful is small: the project is too disadvantageous for Europe. However, if this happens, major and rich unions may appear on both sides of Eurasia, which will account for about 80% of the global trade. What’s more, the USA will control each of them. Therefore, the TPP and T-TIP member states may considerably reduce the trade volume with the rest of the world, including the People’s Republic of China, which is currently the largest trade partner for most of them. In addition, one of China’s major projects, which it is laying high hopes – the New Silk Road – will be exposed to risk. It should connect Europe and Asia and become a free trade zone itself in the future. This scenario is surely unacceptable for both China and many other countries in Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific Region. In order to successfully compete with the TPP and T-TIP, the EAEU states and the states of the Asia-Pacific Region should put great effort into mutual integration. This integration would allow Russia, China, India, ASEAN and Central Asia to be more confident in the face of competition. However, many states that do not wish to cooperate with the USA have fears about a powerful and expansive China. This is an obstacle to regional unification. Perhaps, the emergence of a third power, such as the EAEU, will be a solution to the situation and will help establish a successful partnership.

       "  'Share on Facebook \\nWhile visiting a Chili’s restaurant in Cedar Hills, Texas, U.S. Army Veteran Ernest Walker was approached by the manager and had his military service questioned even though he had his military ID with him. Chili’s offers free meals to Veterans on Veterans Day as a thank you for their service, but what Walker received was anything but. \\nNoticing what was happening, Walker took out his phone and began to record everything that was being said to him. At one point, even his food was stripped away from him. There’s really no other way to see this than an act of racism, and Chili’s needs to answer for it. \\nWalker wrote on Facebook : \\n“I went there to get a Veterans meal and all was good. I had my service dog with me because I am on Dialysis and he monitors my BP. I ordered the waitress was wonderful. It took about 35 mins for meal to come. So when it attived I gave her a Tip as asjed for a take out. She said sure, at that point a old white guy wearing a Trump flag shirt walked buy me on hi way to the bath room. He came back and aked me what unit did i serve in the 24th. I said no the 25th. He said he was in world war 2 in Germany and we did not see people like you over there. They would no allow blacks. I just listened he left then came back to bathroom again and pet my dog. So waitress put foid in container. Then the managers comes and says a somes guest at the restaurant say that your not a real Soldier. I reply what are you serious what guest. The manager Wesly Patrick said can I see military ID. I felt that was reasonable I most people ask for that so I shoed him my ID it checked out. At that point all he should have said was ‘Sir I am sorry Thank you for your service and I would have left. But instead ge says ‘ tbe guest also says that your service dog is not a service dog. Now that’s when igot upset and started Recording so see for yourself what happened.” \\nWatch the altercation here: \\nChili’s did respond by saying : \\n“We are aware of the situation that happened at our Chili’s Cedar Hills location yesterday. Our goal is to make every guest feel special. Unfortunately, we fell short on a day we strive to honor our Veterans and active military for their service. We have escalated this to the highest levels of our company.” \\nHopefully, all of this will be resolved properly and Walker given the respect that he deserves. \\nThe fact that some manager of a local Chili’s restaurant felt so bold to question anyone’s service to deny them a meal is just beyond comprehension. \\nWatch the story here via CBS DFW: \\nFeatured image via video screen capture '],\n",
       " ['Biden Blames “Lazy American Women” For The Economy: “They Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work”',\n",
       "  'U.S. Politics \\nDemocratic Vice President Joe Biden wants American women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy. “If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent,” he said. “That’s trillions of dollars over the next decade.” \\nBiden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. “The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word: pitiful,” he argued. “We’re still battling recession, I don’t care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And we’re not doing anything about it.” \\nHe added that it was “lazy American women” who brought about the downfall of the economy, because “they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them.” “I’m not sure how exactly we got to this point, but we’re here and we need to move. Like, yesterday,” he said. \\n“Mark my words and mark them well,” he addressed the crowd. “Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, she’s a woman herself and not just any woman; she’s a self-made woman. So you better believe what she’s saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times.” \\n“Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a free-loader when your husband is the bread-winner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. She’s been all that and she’s learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add,” Biden continued. \\n“Today’s women are pampered and aren’t used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own,” the vice president said. “They’re too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is they’ve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics: when a sought-after commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.” \\n“Now, that’s all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, it’s the economy that’s missing out on valuable workforce. And that’s why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States. We need to heal this country, folks, not run it into the ground even deeper,” Biden concluded. via: therightists.com Biden Blames “Lazy American Women” For The Economy: “They Sit Around Doing Nothing, Only Hillary Can Force Them To Work” Share this: '],\n",

       " ['Reincarnation is Fact: Documented Cases (Part One) | Humans Are Free',\n",
       "  'Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2011/02/proofs-that-reincarnation-exists-part.html Dr. Helen Wambach set about to prove how foolish the whole idea of reincarnation was by conducting a scientific investigation of her own in the 1960s. Dr. Wambach questioned 1088 white, middle class subjects from California while they were under hypnosis. The subjects were asked to regress to a former life. If this was successful, they were told to remember everything when they awoke from their hypnotic state. Not satisfied to just ask who they were or when they lived, Dr. Wambach also made them describe their status, gender, race, clothing, footwear, utensils, tools they used, their money, housing and even the food they ate! The subjects frequently reported viewing the former lives much like watching a movie. They said they could experience whatever the individual experienced in that particular time. They heard ancient languages but did not understand them. The full details of their experiences were recorded both during and after the sessions. Never before had past life inquiries been that specific or involved such a large population. The results of her 10 years of research surprised everyone. The detailed reports were thoroughly investigated to see if they corresponded with historical facts. In all but 11 cases (less than 1%), the descriptions were totally accurate. Some of the results are as follows: -50.6 % of the past lives reported were male and 49.4 % were female -- this is exactly in accordance with biological fact. -The reported class or status was exactly the same proportion as the estimates of historians of the specific period of the former life. In general, this was approximately 10% upper class, 20-35% from the middle class and the remaining 55-70% from the lower class. Although the proportion of middle class was higher around 1000 BC, the proportion later dropped and increased again after 1700 AD. -The recall by subjects of clothing, footwear, type of food and utensils used was better than that in popular history books. She found over and over again that her subjects knew better than most historians -- when she went to obscure experts her subjects were invariably correct. A subject who lived around 1000 B.C in Egypt described different types of clothing worn by the upper and lower classes. The upper classes wore either a half-length or full-length white cotton robe. The lower classes wore something like an exotic-looking type of pants that was wrapped downwards from the waist. The researchers viewed historic records of clothing worn during the respective periods and could therefore compare it to the descriptions of these subjects. The descriptions were found to be correct. -Between 60-77% of the ancient population lived at or below the poverty level. They wore home made clothes and lived in simple, even primitive, abodes. The majority were farmers who labored every day in the fields. None of the hypnotized individuals recalled being a famous historical figure. Those who recalled a high social position seemed highly dissatisfied with their lives, as if it was a burden to be alive. Those who recalled being a farmer or a member of a primitive tribe appeared to be content. -Their recollections were from different geographic areas and races during their prior life. Dr. Wambach divided them into several categories: Caucasians, Asians, Indians, Blacks and Middle Eastern descent. Around 2000 BC, only 20% of the subjects reported that they were Caucasians. They lived widely dispersed throughout what is now known as the Middle East, the Mediterranean, Europe and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, etc., called the central steppe during historical times). -Five subjects stated that they lived in Central Asia between 1000 and 2000 BC. They recalled living in tents, which was common to the migrating population of that region. Amazingly, they found themselves to have white skin color and yellow or golden hair! At first, this didn\\'t appear to be historically accurate as Asian people should have black hair and darker skin. However, recent discoveries of mummified corpses along the ancient Spice Route have shown that there were indeed light skinned and blond haired people! -Eating habits of people who lived around 500 B. C. were not that bad. Twenty percent of the subjects recalled that they ate poultry and sheep meat. However, between A.D. 25 to A.D. 1200, people\\'s eating habits were rather poor. The subjects recalled that the food was tasteless. One young man said: \"I will never bad-mouth McDonald\\'s food\". It is not surprising that those who recalled the best tasting food were those who remembered a prior life in China. -Among all the subjects, 62% died of old age and illness, 18% percent died violently during war, or some other manmade catastrophe and the remaining 20% died in accidents. Many of the prior lives ended during the two world wars, as well as civil wars in Asian countries. Thus, these people reincarnated shortly after they died. We will see more evidence for this in our next striking example. Surprisingly, Dr. Wambach found that 69% of the subjects who had died during the 1850\\'s were Caucasians, while between 1900 and 1945, only 40% were Caucasian. It seems that transmigration of the different races increased after 1945. This is still not understood. Dr. Wambach went on to publish her findings in RelivingPast Lives: The Evidence Under Hypnosis and Life Before Life (1984). Although she began her work as a skeptic, she would later write, \"...Fantasy and genetic memory could not account for the patterns that emerged in the results. With the exception of 11 subjects, all descriptions of clothing, footwear, and utensils were consistent with historical records...\" And in later interviews, she stated, \" I don\\'t believe in reincarnation - I know it! \" As we mentioned in the report, Dr. Wambach\\'s results suggest that reincarnation usually happens shortly after death. In the next example we will see an amazing case that saw a reincarnated woman who was able to be reunited with her husband and son after remembering her former life at the age of 4 years old! This famous case was thoroughly studied by both believers and skeptics of reincarnation -- including the famous religious teacher, Mahatma Ghandhi. It happened in the 1930s in India... The Story of Shanti Devi On January 18,1902, a daughter was born to a family named Chaturbhuj, residents of Mathura, India. Her name was Lugdi. When Lugdi was 10, a marriage was arranged with a man named Kedarnath Chaube, a shopkeeper in the same village. After puberty, Lugdi became pregnant for the first time but her child was stillborn following a Cesarean section. During her second pregnancy, Kedarnath took her to the government hospital at Agra, where a son was born, again through a Cesarean. There were some complications, however, and several days later, on October 4, Lugdi\\'s condition deteriorated and she died at 10 A.M. One year ten months and seven days after Lugdi\\'s death, on December 11, 1926, a beautiful daughter was born to Babu Rang Bahadur Mathur of Chirawala Mohulla, a small locality of Delhi. The girl was named Shanti Devi. Shanti was unusually quiet and hardly spoke until she was four years old. When she started talking, she surprised her family by telling them, \"This is not my real home! I have a husband and a son in Mathura! I must return to them!\" Shanti said that her husband was in Mathura where he owned a cloth shop and they had a son. She called herself Chaubine (Chaube\\'s wife). The parents considered it a child\\'s fantasy and took no notice. They got worried, however, when she talked repeatedly about it and, over time, narrated a number of incidents connected with her life in Mathura with her husband. On occasions at meals, Shanti would say, \"In my house in Mathura, I ate different kinds of sweets.\" Sometimes when her mother was dressing her she would tell what type of dresses she used to wear. Curiously, she mentioned three distinctive features about her husband: he was fair, had a big wart on his left cheek, and wore reading glasses. She also mentioned that her husband\\'s shop was located in front of Dwarkadhish temple. This strange talk continued. By this time Shanti was six-year-old, and her parents were perplexed and worried. Shanti even gave a detailed account of her death following childbirth. They consulted their family physician who was amazed how this little girl correctly described so many details of the complicated surgical procedures she claimed to have endured. As Shanti grew older, she insisted that her parents take her to Mathura. All this time, however, she never mentioned her husband\\'s name. It is customary in India that wives do not speak the name of their husbands. Even when specifically asked, Shanti would only blush and say, \"I will recognize him, if I am taken there.\" Her parents thought their daughter was mentally ill and tried everything to discourage her strange talk. But Shanti continued to talk about her \"other family\" and gave a specific address and more details about her previous home, her husband and his family. Eventually, a teacher in Ramjas High School Daryaganj in Delhi, told Shanti that if she told him her husband\\'s name, he would take her to Mathura. Convinced, she whispered his name into his ear -- \"Kedarnath Chaube.\" The teacher told her that he would arrange for the trip to Mathura after he had made some inquiries. He wrote a letter to Kedarnath Chaube, detailing all that Shanti had said, and invited him to visit Delhi. Amazingly, the teacher received a quick reply from Kedarnath, admitting that his young wife, Lugdi, had recently passed away. Even more amazing was that all the details Shanti had described about her old house and members of her previous family were all true! Shanti\\'s story spread all over India through the media. Many intellectuals became interested in it. When the famous teacher and pacifist, Mahatma Gandhi, heard about it, he personally talked to Shanti and then requested her to stay in his ashram. Gandhi instigated a committee to investigate and report on the claims the little girl was making. Soon a committee of 15 prominent people, including polticians, national leaders and members from the media was formed and they persuaded Shanti\\'s parents to allow her to accompany them Mathura. Upon arriving at Mathura by train, Shanti -- on her own -- quickly lead them straight to her previous home. She correctly described what it had looked like years earlier -- before its recent refurbishing. As a test, to mislead Shanti Devi, Kanjimal introduced Kedarnath as his elder brother. Shanti blushed and stood on one side. Someone asked why she was blushing in front of her husband\\'s elder brother. Shanty said, \"No, he is not my husband\\'s brother. He is my husband himself.\" Then she addressed her mother, \"Didn\\'t I tell you that he is fair and he has a wart on the left side cheek near his ear?\" She then asked her mother to prepare meals for the guests. When the mother asked what should she prepare, she said that he was fond of stuffed potato paranthas and pumpkin-curry. Kedarnath was speechless, as these were his favorite meals. He asked whether she could tell them anything \"unusual\" to help him accept that this was really his former wife. Shanti replied, \"Yes, there is a well in the courtyard of our house, where I used to take my bath.\" She was also able to relate extremely intimate information, such as extramarital affairs of family members that no one, outside the family, could possibly have known. But that wasn\\'t enough to convinced Kedarnath. He needed something reallyprivate, that only his dead wife would know. Apparently, Lugdi had suffered from painful arthritis, making it difficult for her to move. This presented problems when the couple tried to have sex. But Lugdi had found a way to move that enabled her to have relations with her husband. This was an extremely private matter, yet Shanti was able to describe this in intimate detail.That convinced him! '],\n",

       "  'Getty - John Shearer / Staff \\nComedian Patton Oswalt can still recall the details of that horrible day in April where he lost his beloved wife, Michelle McNamara. \\nThe night before, the 46-year-old McNamara, a true crime author, was exhausted from her day and night search for a serial murderer she had dubbed the “Golden State Killer.” She was convinced she was closing in on the man she believed killed dozens in the 1970s and \\'80s. \\nOswalt, who was concerned about her health, suggested that she “sleep until you wake up,\" a common phrase of the parents used, according to a recent interview with The New York Times: \\nSo the weary McNamara took a Xanax and quickly fell into a deep sleep. She would never wake up. \\nThat morning Oswalt took their 7-year-old daughter, Alice, to school and even picked up Michelle\\'s favorite coffee on the way home. \\nAt 9:40 a.m., when Owsalt returned, she was still sound asleep and snoring.

That’s what the paramedics there were saying while I was screaming and throwing up.” \\nThe dangers of the prescription drug Xanax, a brand of benzodiazepines, or “benzos,” cannot be understated. The medication is meant to treat anxiety, but it can easily be abused . \\nIn combination with alcohol, Xanax (and other benzos) can cause users to experience complete “blackouts” for extended periods of time. \\nIt\\'s incredibly addicting and very easy to overdose on.

Smoking Cigarettes Causes 150 Genetic Mutations and Cancer Prev post Next post \\nBreakthrough research discovered that smoking one pack of cigarettes every day can lead to 150 cell mutations in a year. These mutations can occur in different regions of the body, increasing the risk of smokers to develop cancers not just in areas that are in direct contact with inhaled chemicals. \\nA comprehensive study, the first of its kind, probed deeper into the effects of smoking on the human body through the use of a pattern recognition program. The methodology is likened to recording the noise in a roomful of people and then separating individual voices to better hear them. \\nA group of collaborating researchers studied and compared 5,000 cancerous tumors from those who are habitual smokers and those who have not smoked a single cigarette in their life. The results were staggering with 150 different kinds of mutations in different parts of the body. The Main Reasons to Quit Smoking Quit Smoking Now! \\nYou reduce your risk of getting serious disease no matter what age you give up. However, the sooner you stop, the greater the reduction in your risk. In fact, researchers have found that if you quit smoking before the age of 50 your risk of dying is virtually reduced to that of a non-smoker. \\nEven if you give up after the age of 60, your risk of dying at any given age is reduced by about 39% compared to a person who carries on smoking. If you stop smoking you: Reduce the risk of getting serious smoking-related diseases such as heart disease, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and peripheral vascular disease. Reduce the risk of getting various other conditions which, although not life-threatening, can cause unpleasant problems. For example: Erection problems (impotence). Optic neuropathy – this is a condition affecting the nerve supplying the eye. Cataracts. A breakdown of the tissue at the back of the eye (macular degeneration). A skin condition called psoriasis. Gum disease. ‘Thinning’ of the bones (osteoporosis). Raynaud’s phenomenon – in this condition, fingers turn white or blue when exposed to cold. Reduce the risk of pregnancy complications if you are pregnant. If you have smoked since being a teenager or young adult: If you quit smoking before the age of about 35, your life expectancy is only slightly less than it is for people who have never smoked. If you stop smoking before the age of 50, you decrease the risk of dying from smoking-related diseases by 50%. \\nIt is never too late to quit smoking to gain health benefits. Even if you already have COPD or heart disease, your outlook (prognosis) is much improved if you quit smoking. \\nPlanning and support can help you quit smoking for good. Before your quit day, take time to prepare for challenges. Make a plan for quitting. Know what to expect in the first days of being smokefree. Identify your reasons for quitting and plan how to ask for help if you need it. Quit Smoking!

       " ['US-Korean Relations and the New US President | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Eastern Asia While observing the reaction of the Korean society to the victory of D. Trump in the Presidential elections, a great grief can be seen – the political circles of South Korea supported Clinton owing to Trump’s desire to increase the charge for maintaining the American contingent in the Republic of Korea as the bare minimum. This contingent currently includes 28.5 thousand military personnel, F-16 destroyers, the Patriot anti-aircraft weapon system, and other types of offensive and defensive weapons. South Korea will need 16.3 billion dollars to replace them and given the economic crisis and political challenges, it will be difficult for Seoul to find that kind of money. As soon as the US elections result was announced, Park Geun-hye congratulated Trump on his victory and noted that the American nation had expressed confidence in his leadership skills and huge successful experience in various fields. The head of the Republic of Korea also highlighted that Seoul would maintain close cooperation with Washington aimed at global stability and prosperity. The very same day, on November 9, the Korean President’s Administration conducted an emergency session of the National Security Council. Park Geun-hye ordered that emergency response measures regarding the economy and security be prepared amid the new environment. On November 10, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Korea held a session to assess the results of the Presidential elections in the USA. As a result, the military officials confirmed their position regarding continued cooperation with the USA on the rotational deployment of the US strategic forces in the Republic of Korea, the THAAD ABM mobile system, and the transfer of operational control over its military forces to Seoul in time of war. In addition, it was decided to create a Working Group on Cooperation with the USA in defence policy aimed at maintaining the strong union between the Republic of Korea and the USA. The first result of this Group’s work was a report delivered on November 14, which states that the US government may demand an increase in the expenses paid by South Korea for maintaining the American military contingent as well as improving the capabilities of its own army. The former policy of Barack Obama will be replaced with more active sanction pressure that allows dialogue, however. In this context, the American party should receive explanation of what measures are taken by the Republic of Korea to ensure the comfortable presence of the US contingent and it should be specified that the armed forces of the USA are contributing to peace and stability in the region. The expenses of the Republic of Korea for the maintenance of the US contingent in terms of GDP share are higher than that in Japan and Germany. A possible reconsideration of free trade conditions has also been noted. The Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Yoo Il-ho said that Donald Trump’s victory in the elections could provide the South Korean economy with new opportunities. South Korean companies might participate in the development of infrastructure and industry in the USA. Thus, the Korean government has started preparing to work with the new American government by conducting a detailed monitoring of Trump’s economic program. Commenting on the authorities’ activities, the Korean media write that it is difficult to assess Donald Trump’s policy regarding the North. One day he called Kim Jong-un a maniac, and the other day he didn’t rule out possible dialogue with Pyongyang, regarding solution to the North Korean nuclear issue. As for the potential tense situations in relations between the Republic of Korea and the USA that require reconsideration, they concern more than Korea’s share of the expenses for the maintenance of the American military contingent. Currently, South Korea covers half of them, but Trump has expressed the opinion that the Republic of Korea should take on 100% of the expenses and the funds spent by the USA on the security of its allies should be used for its own needs. In addition, he has also spoken about the possible nuclearization of the Republic of Korea and Japan. Despite the fact that the radical conservators of the Republic of Korea are already discussing such a variant, Seoul is against it, maintaining that it would deteriorate regional stability. In addition, Donald Trump believes that the conditions of the free trade agreement between the Republic of Korea and the USA are not equal and deprive Americans of jobs. He has announced the need to reconsider the corresponding agreements. All these facts could not help but raise concerns among traditional US allies. The lack of direct communication channels with Donald Trump’s team is also generating fears. Hoping for Clinton’s success, the South Korean politicians did not establish relations with her opponent. Thus, the necessity to make preliminary preparations for cooperation with the new US government is felt as never before. However, there have been no sharp changes in policy observed so far. On November 09, 2016, during the previous briefing, White House spokesperson Joshua Earnest noted that the Administration of Donald Trump would likely stick to the policy of maintaining strong relations between Washington and Seoul. Both the Democrats and the Republicans have been working to strengthen relations between the USA and the Republic of Korea. Moreover, any stand-out problems in relations between the two countries (for example, under Park Chung-hee and Carter) arose with greater frequency under the Democrats. The next day, on November 10, during a telephone conversation with the President of the Republic of Korea Park Geun-hye, Donald Trump confirmed Washington’s commitment to the union with Seoul and provision of South Korea’s security. According to the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, over the course of the ten minute talk, Donald Trump announced that Washington would certainly continue to cooperate with Seoul on security issues. Some American experts also believe that there will be no changes. For example, the former Chairman of the United States House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Pieter Hoekstra, believes that the new government headed by Donald Trump will maintain strong relations with the Republic of Korea. Hoekstra has highlighted that Seoul and Washington currently enjoy close economic and security cooperation, and South Korea believes that this statement is aimed at defusing concerns. Of course, according to KBS World Radio, Trump’s forceful statements are a reflection of his attitude. Perhaps, it was only linked to his desire to gain the support of a large number of voters, however. South Korean experts hope that Trump’s strong statements will not be implemented in the new government’s actual policy and they will stick to more restrained and reasonable policy. The South Korean opposition is of the same opinion. The faction leader of the opposition Democratic Party Toburo Woo Sang-ho has announced that American lawmakers do not want changes in the relations between the Republic of Korea and the USA, thus, the Koreans should not worry about Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections. The leader of the opposition People’s Party Park Jie-won has also noted that Donald Trump will conduct policy from a practical point of view and the Republic of Korea may enjoy some benefits. The author is also inclined to think that radical changes in the two countries’ relations will not take place and has expressed this point of view many times . Therefore, we will only return to this topic if a serious reason for concern arises.

       " ['Hillary’s ‘Russian Hack’ Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election Season',\n",
       "  'November 1, 2016 By 21wire 4 Comments \\nPatrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire \\nThe longer this soap opera drags on, it’s becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not ‘hack’ into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta’s emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. \\nThe White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that ‘Putin is hacking the US elections.’ In response, the President is weighing his options – tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed ‘malicious cyber-activity’ tools. \\nEven VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,”We’re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.” \\nIt seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? \\nWhat was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America’s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton’s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington’s new anti-Russia movement. \\nOn July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, “The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton’s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.” \\nAnyone who was paying attention back then knew this ‘Russian hack’ talking point was purely political, but then again, who’s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. \\nYou can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party’s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump’s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump’s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, ‘comparing one dictator to another.’ \\nNever one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . “If you’ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party’s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?” said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. \\nBacked by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia – not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona – a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media’s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled, “ Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system ,” we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: \\n“Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.” \\nBut then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: \\n“The bureau described the threat as “credible” and significant, “an eight on a scale of one to 10,” Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state’s voter registration system for nearly a week.” \\nAnd then, down to almost nothing… \\n“It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County.” \\nAt no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, “Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack.” \\nAre American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: ‘bottom of the bag’) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories – in the middle a national election cycle? It’s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. \\nBehind Clinton’s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House… \\nOn October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta – giving them to Wikileaks. \\nSoon, there was a queue of ‘national security’ politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, “Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin’s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, \\xadcyber and economic response.” \\nAccording to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only ‘evidence’ that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged ‘Russian government hacks’– provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike’s word for it. \\nIMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. \\nThe Post’s Nakashima then added: \\n“The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers.” \\nAn online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are “consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,” the joint statement said. “… We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.” \\nMoscow’s press secretary’s reply: “This is some sort of nonsense,” said Dmitry Peskov. \\nDespite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN’s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really “confirmed” that Russia was behind the email hacks – and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. \\nLikewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that “Russia did it,” thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn’t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona – are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a ‘ parallel universe .’ \\nStill, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how “ 17 US intelligence agencies ” aka the “Intelligence Community”– all agreed that Russia did it. \\nThe announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \\n“We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,” said Clinton. “I find that deeply disturbing.” \\nWhat’s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton’s ’17 agencies’: \\nAir Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \\nWhat does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta’s emails? Answer: nothing. \\nThe exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. \\nIn both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington’s flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and “journalists” working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN – none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party’s decree that “Russian is hacking the US election process.” If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: “… [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow — the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.” According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are ‘hacking’ US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a “ disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. ” \\nUnder partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into “people linked to the Trump team with Russia.” Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven’t come up with anything. \\nTo be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack – because her staff read it to her from the campaign’s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government’s much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, that’s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam’s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq’s imaginary “Winnebagos of Death” aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. \\nFor those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as ‘Washington Intelligence,’ I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, “No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We’re not like that. No, this time it’s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!” \\nIn 2014, Obama claimed that Kim’s notorious “Bureau 121” hacked into Sony Pictures. \\nThis isn’t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign ‘hack’ and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington’s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called ‘ Bureau 121 .’ Just like with today’s “Russian Hack” theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House’s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the ‘Russian Hack’ claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . \\nJumping the Shark \\nAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. \\nSoon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to “destabilize and dominate the West.” Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of ‘interfering’ with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russia’s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump’s refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 \\n— Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 \\nClinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only ‘evidence’ seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as ‘proof’ that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign’s desperate claims. It was embarrassing. \\nThey could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. \\nEither way, the political strategy here is clear – to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video – their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. \\nTheir other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. \\nTo prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. “For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,” said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. “I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year’s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week’s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,” said Clinton. \\nThe party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. \\nParty Meltdown \\nWasserman Schultz’s replacement didn’t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches – showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives – straight to Hillary Clinton. \\n“ A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN’s Jake Tapper.” \\n“ A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.” (Source: Daily Caller ) \\nBrazile’s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party’s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: \\n. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Brazile’s reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her – and that’s saying a lot. \\nIn addition, it was also revealed how CNN’s head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of ‘journalists’ the Clinton campaign would “work with” to gain favorable coverage. You’d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN’s election coverage. \\nClearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN\\'s Gloria Borger refers to being in \"GOP hell\" and says she\\'ll \"reach out soon\" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5 \\n— 400-lb Hacker Owens (@NubianAwakening) October 21, 2016 \\nWorse Than Watergate \\nPerhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury – is the FBI’s investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: \\n“Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn’t unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.” \\nThere’s more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe – a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . \\nSo why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top – to the President himself. \\nWhat 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary’s unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton’s server “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.” The President’s lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: \\n“Obama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton’s private email server.” \\nSo, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails “off grid” with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server – maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. \\nSure, he’s not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club – caught out lying to the American people. \\nOn top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as “ born classified .” The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. \\nCOVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) \\nIt should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action – that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. \\nOn Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case – currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a ‘sexting’ scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: \\n“Oh yes. Recall our post from last week, “ Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary’s Benghazi Hearing ” in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton’s Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik.” \\nOh, and if that wasn’t good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta’s lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as ‘best friends.’ FOX News confirms: \\n“Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,” Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta’s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. \\nTo call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. \\nRussia – The Party Scapegoat \\nFormer Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: “Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.” Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. \\n— Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 \\nAnother veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused “the KGB” working with Republicans to “hijack the election” during his wild rant on MSNBC . \\n“I think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That’s what I think,” said Carville. \\nMaybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. \\nThese are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many exposés revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence – unlike the ‘Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks.’ \\nSuffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that ‘Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.’ They’ve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep – a perfect double entendre . \\nThe geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington’s State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown – that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed ‘rebels’ Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. \\nWith so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? \\nThe demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d’etat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it’s been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks – and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America’s own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , “We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram,” He was forced to resign shortly after that. \\nWhat’s clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although ‘ Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 ,’ and ‘ Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 ‘ certainly comes to mind. \\nThat said, it’s hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of ‘Hacking Into the US Electoral Process.’ When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington’s claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election \\nOn Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: \\n“We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It’s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security.” \\nSelf-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. \\nKnowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere – if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. \\nStill, we’re waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington – before it’s too late. \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV \\nFiled Under: Featured , Patrick Henningsen , Shout , US News Tagged With: CNN , Debbie Wasserman Schultz , Donna Brazile , Gloria Borger , Hillary Clinton , Media Cog , Russia , wikileaks WillDippel \\nHere is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: \\nSometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory.

       " ['Who will tell the people? Russian institute exposes Western media lies - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  \"This post was originally published on this site \\nsott.net/news \\n© Shannon Stapleton / Reuters \\nMoscow-based Institute of Oriental Studies under the Russian Academy of Sciences (IVRAN) presented a devastating report about the lies of the Western mainstream media about Syria. \\nBut this damning report is not getting the attention it deserves by the mainstream media in the West. However, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. There are many facts in the Institute’s report that would make sensations in the EU and the US, had they unmasked the Russian, and not the Western, media falsifications. \\nIn a similar situation, there was a whole media frenzy in the US and EU media in 2014, when a Russian television channel released an interview with a woman refugee from the rebellious Eastern Ukraine, who provided the unconfirmed report about a local boy being crucified by Ukrainian government troops. Meanwhile, in its report, IVRAN proved much cruder, intentional falsifications on the side of the Western media reports about Syria. \\nFor example, IVRAN’s report proves the falsity of a news item published in Britain’s The Daily Express on October 1, 2015, at the very start of Russian air forces’ operation against terrorists in Syria on an invitation from the Syrian government. \\nThe report said that “a Russian air strike on Thursday destroyed a mosque in the town of Jisr Al Shughour, which was taken from government forces by Islamist insurgents earlier this year.” Having studied the photos of the area, made from the planes on October 29, 2015, the researchers from Institute of Oriental Studies proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the mosque in Jisr Al Shughour remained intact in the end of the month, i.e. it had been intact during all of October, 2015. The Russian specialists on Arab studies from IVRAN say they proved that The Daily Express simply provided unverified information from the local opposition activists. \\nUnfortunately, the information on Jisr Al Shughour’s bombing was also cited by London-based The Daily Telegraph, as well as other British and global media. \\nThe Institute for oriental Studies made an important observation. Accusing Russia of not bombing the so called Islamic State (ISIL) and thus not damaging the Islamist terrorists’ infrastructure, the Western mainstream media has not been providing its readers adequate information on OTHER, non-ISIL Islamist groups in the area, some of them no less dangerous than the ISIL. For example, The Daily Telegraph reported on that same day that “Russians continued their aerial bombardment on Thursday, targets included Jisr al-Shughour and Jabal al-Zawiya, areas under the control of Jaish al-Fatah, the Army of Conquest, an alliance of Islamist groups which have won significant victories against the regime this year.” \\nSo, reporting from the same area, The Telegraph actually names the groups which Express called rather vaguely “Islamist insurgents.” These were actually very dangerous terrorist groups of pseudo-Islamic character: Jaish al-Fatakh and the Army of Conquest. They are often cited as terrorist groups by international human rights organizations, some of their members are accused of mistreating the people who work in human rights’ groups. \\nWill you report our findings? \\nWhen the director of the Institute for Oriental Studies, Vitaly Naumkin, was presenting the findings of his colleagues at the press center of Rossiya Segodnya information agency, he was asked a question by a journalist from the Syrian official agency, Sana. “Will the Western media publish what you found or will they keep reporting the same stuff about Syria…?” Naumkin, who had just been asked a question on his Institute’s report by a female correspondent of The Financial Times, readdressed Sana’s question to her. \\n“There is so much news today, and I am not yet in my office,” FT’s Kathrin Hille answered. “So, I am not sure we shall report on your findings.” \\n“I know you won’t,” professor Naumkin noted, smiling bitterly. \\nAccording to Naumkin, Russia’s policy in Syria has become a target of a deliberate disinformation attack from the Western media, especially after the presence of Russia’s air force near Damascus was unveiled in September 2015. \\n“Why is the Western media attacking us so bitterly?” Naumkin asked rhetorically during his press conference. “Because the process of national reconciliation is under way in Syria. And this process is Russia’s main purpose in that area, on the par only with the imperative of damaging or, better, destroying the so called Islamic State. So, the Western media indeed don’t want Russia to achieve its aim, misrepresenting our countries priorities as ‘support for the regime’ or ‘a proxy war against the Western interests.'” \\nMainstream media’s self-exposure \\nIn their report, the experts of Naumkin’s Institute for Oriental Studies noted that some of the Western myths about the civil war in Syria are debunked by the Western media itself – in its rare moments of truth. \\nFor example, at the beginning of the civil war in 2011, the Western media kept saying there were no terrorists among the anti-Assad opposition fighters and that the opposition force was home-grown, not including foreign mercenaries. But already, on August 8, 2013, The New York Times , Anne Barnard and Eric Schmitt, reported from the ISIL’s zone of operations that “the jihadist groups in Syria now include more than 6,000 foreigners.” \\nThe NYT also reported then that the areas controlled by the Syrian opposition and previously described as “liberated” by the Western mainstream media, “may be developing into one of the biggest terrorist threats in the world today” (in fact, they were in the final stages of becoming ISIL-controlled territories). \\nJeffrey Sachs, a prominent US economist and world-known mentor of the Russian liberal reformer Yegor Gaidar, wrote already in September 2013 on the Western governments’ pursuit of a violent overthrow of Syria’s President Assad: “Without their involvement, Assad’s regime would most likely have remained repressive; with their involvement, Syria has become a site of mass death and destruction.” \\nThe ever-changing David Ignatius, of The Washington Post , back in 2012 penned an article headlined ‘Syria’s Eerie Parallel to 1980s Afghanistan.’ In it, Ignatius wrote certain truths which The Washington Post is now trying to make its readers forget: “In Syria, as in Afghanistan, CIA officers are operating… helping Sunni insurgents improve their command and control and engaging in other activities (!). Weapons are coming from third parties (in Afghanistan, they came mostly from China and Egypt; in Syria, they are mainly brought from the black market). And finally, the major financier for both insurgencies has been Saudi Arabia.” \\nDoes one need to remind the reader how the US-backed insurgents in Afghanistan ultimately turned their weapons against the very people who procured them? \\nMr. Ignatius writes about this development in his own article in The Washington Post : “This CIA-backed victory [in Afghanistan] opened the way for decades of chaos and and jihadist extremism that are still menacing Afghanistan, its neighbors and even the United States.” \\nHaving read Ignatius, one listens with special attention to the warning of Professor Vitaly Naumkin, who concludes his presentation with the following statement: “We are in fact in the same trench with the West, facing the same global threat of terrorism. The problem is that the Western leaders are simply too slow to understand this.” \\nOne could not put it better. \\nDmitry Babich was born in Moscow, in 1970. He has worked for various media outlets for 25 years, including The Moscow News and RIA Novosti news agency. He is currently working as a political analyst at Sputnik International, and is a frequent guest on BBC, Al Jazeera, CNN commenting on international affairs and history. Related \"],\n",

He points his fingers and smiles that Apprentice smile as he makes a point. \\nOn the right side of this picture, we have Barack Obama – a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude, who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant. He sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud, the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office.

Barack Obama’s image of himself is not accurate – to Americans, Obama is a reality TV show star. He transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfie-stick, celebrity-ridden sinkhole of Hollywood glitterati, hobnobbing with Glozell and Macklemore, cracking wise about the presidency with Jimmy Kimmel before saying that a reality star like Trump could never be president. \\nThis picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost, as Obama’s former pastor might put it. \\nAnd then there’s Lincoln. \\nLincoln, who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration, mourning behind Barack Obama, who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain. \\nLincoln, who represented wisdom, mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd.

       " ['EU Red Scare: Brussels Passes New Resolution to ‘Counter Russian Media Propaganda’',\n",
       "  '\\n21st Century Wire says… \\nIf there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the EU’s super bureaucratic class, those doubts can finally be put to rest this week. It seems that Europe’s technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of ‘Euro Red Scare’ brainwashing. \\nThe new EU Resolution compares Russian media organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS (see full report below). The report also claims that Russian “ social media and internet trolls ” are somehow “ challenging democratic values .” The new anti-Russia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the ‘anti-Russia’ programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this ‘grave threat to democracy.’ A touch oxymoronic, isn’t it? \\nEU Parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot. Claiming that Europe is currently ‘at war with Russia’ is one thing, but the hysterical notion that “Russian propaganda” is somehow damaging the minds of Europeans is a whole new level of crazy. \\nNo wonder millions of Britons voted to leave the EU this past summer. \\nThe cold reality is that most of the ‘dangerous views and information’ aired on RT are by presenters, contributors and pundits — westerners , not Russians. The reason RT’s audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see RT’s reports as more accurate, and truthful than media monoliths like the BBC, CNN and other establishment outlets. By spending most of their time, effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally, the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences. The age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over. RT understood this in 2005 when their news network took shape. 11 years later, western media moguls are playing catch-up, albeit in vain.Sunset for Goebbels. Hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a Deep State star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge – obsessed with controlling real information, rather than disseminating it – that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good. They are simply unable to do authentic journalism, or speak truth to power . Incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in Brussels want to attack RT. \\nThe faceless force behind this latest xenophobic EU resolution are those in Washington, Paris and London who are still hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions in place – much to the disservice of many European businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with Russia. When Donald Trump is sworn in this January, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis could disintegrate within a year – so this latest move by Brussels could be a last-ditch effort to do some damage as Europe’s NeoMcCarthyites plot their escape out the back door. From their disastrous coup d’etat in the Ukraine , to NATO’s hubris in the Baltic and beyond, and the EU’s ‘migrant crisis’ debacle, and the tens of millions of Euros being laundered by EU member states through a pseudo NGO called the ‘ White Helmets’ in Syria – these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history – an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. \\nWe tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. See the following video and written report by RT International… \\n. RT MEPs in Strasbourg have voted on a non-legislative resolution which calls for the EU to “respond to information warfare by Russia.” RT and Sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous “tools” of “hostile propaganda.” \\nThe EU Parliament’s resolution demonstrates “ political degradation ” in regard to the “ idea of democracy ” in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. \\nPutin pointed out that while “ everyone tries to lecture ” Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions, “ which is not the best way ” to deal with any issues. \\n“ The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support one’s point of view should be presented ,” Putin said. \\nAdding that he hopes the Western move to “ counter Russian propaganda ” won’t lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. \\nIn the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution based on the report ‘ EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties ’, with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. \\nWritten by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to “ distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens .” \\nThe report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. \\nAt the same time, Russia is accused of “ information warfare ,” with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda “tools. ” \\nThe document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). \\nThe report also mentions some “ social media and internet trolls ” from Russia who are thought to “ challenge democratic values .” \\nIt called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of “ investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media .” It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO “ on strategic communication .” \\nSputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a number of international journalists’ organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU. \\n“ The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the EU’s own human rights and freedom of press norms,” reads the letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. \\nDuring the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was “ at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter ,” and that with an alleged “ aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries .” '],\n",

       "  'Aaron Bandler November 11, 2016 \\nPresident-elect Donald Trump. That is still a term that is surreal to a lot of people, as he was not expected to win on Tuesday. What were the driving factors that propelled Trump to the presidency? How was he able to pull off such a stunning upset? \\nHere are seven reasons why Trump won. \\n1. Hillary Clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her. Last night, Dems were calling the race a \"Whitelash\" -- wrong. Mitt won 59% of white vote, Trump won 58%. Minority voters didn\\'t turn out. — David French (@DavidAFrench) November 9, 2016 \\nIn fact, Trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than Mitt Romney did in 2012, as the Daily Wire has explained : \\nUnsurprisingly, Trump lost to Clinton in the Latino and black votes by margins of 88 percent to 8 percent and 65 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Surprisingly, this was better than Romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in 2012, as he lost both groups by margins of 93 percent to 7 percent and 71 percent to 27 percent, respectively \\nMichael Barone has noted that \"turnout fell in heavily black Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee. Millennial generation turnout was tepid, and Trump carried white Millennials by 5 points.\" \\nThe enthusiasm was just not there for Clinton. \\n2. Trump was able to pull in former Obama voters. According to the Washington Post , Trump was able to win over one-third of the 700 counties that went for Obama twice. Clinton was only able to win six of the 2,200 counties that didn\\'t go for Obama. Trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than Clinton was. \\nSo who are these former Obama voters who voted for Trump in 2016, and what caused them to switch? \\n3. These former Obama voters felt that Trump cared about them, and the Democrat Party did not. John Daniel Davidson explains in The Federalist that Clinton and the Democrat Party took the blue-collar, working class whites in the Rust Belt for granted–exemplified by Clinton\\'s pledge \"to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business\"–and it was to their detriment. The Rust Belt has been in economic decline for years, but it has suffered greatly from the Obama administration\\'s regulations towards coal. \\nWhile the Democrats wrote off the Rust Belt, Trump actually acknowledged their struggles, and that was all it took. \\n\"Trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them, acknowledged that they have been left behind, that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline, and promised to help out somehow,\" writes Davidson. \"When you’re used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion, as President Obama did in 2008, or denounced as \\'deplorables\\' and \\'irredeemable,\\' as Hillary Clinton did during this election, respect goes a long way—even if there are no easy solutions, from Washington or anywhere else, to the problems that plague your town.\" \\n4. The FBI re-opening its investigation into Hillary\\'s emails helped Trump. Per RedState , author Ed Klein said on the Steve Malzberg Show that Clinton was sobbing \"inconsolably\" on election night and was blaming FBI director James Comey re-opening the investigation as well as Obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost. \\nThere\\'s no question that the re-opening of the investigation did considerably help Trump, as the polls severely tightened after the announcement. Poll numbers showed that the vast majority of Americans felt that Hillary was acting in an immoral manner. The spotlight was off of Trump\\'s vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers, and instead the focus was on Clinton\\'s private email server. But Clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss... \\n5. Hillary was a terrible candidate. If Clinton had been elected president, she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous FBI investigations. She broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official State Department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the Clinton Foundation . Clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure, sleaze, and corruption. Basically, Clinton is \"an Obama Democrat without Obama\\'s charm,\" according to Jonah Goldberg . \\nShe may have been the only Democratic candidate that could lose to Trump, and the Democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning. They have no one to blame but themselves for President Trump. \\n6. The public no longer has any faith in the media–and that includes late-night comics. Will Rahn wrote at CBS News that the \"unbearable smugness\" of the Clinton-biased media was off-putting to a lot of voters, as they sneered at Trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up Clinton. Trump\\'s vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically. Poll numbers reflect this, as trust in the media has declined over the years. Rahn explains: \\nJournalists increasingly don’t even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement, and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way. We see this in the ongoing veneration of “facts,” the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously post-ideological. \\nThat the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soul-searching you’d think it would. Instead, it all just somehow leads us to more smugness, more meanness, more certainty from the reporters and pundits. Faced with defeat, we retreat further into our bubble, assumptions left unchecked. No, it’s the voters who are wrong. \\nAs a direct result, we get it wrong with greater frequency. Out on the road, we forget to ask the right questions. We can’t even imagine the right question. We go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases. The public’s estimation of the press declines even further -- fewer than one-in-three Americans trust the press, per Gallup -- which starts the cycle anew. \\nThe same applies to late-night comics. Mollie Hemingway writes in The Federalist that Jon Stewart is partly responsible for the election of Trump because of how he single-handedly destroyed CNN\\'s Crossfire, resulting in \"a new age of hyper-political, hyper-liberal late-night comedy.\" Stewart\\'s The Daily Show spawned Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Trevor Noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy left-wing political lectures talking down to conservatives. \\n\"Jon Stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day,\" writes Hemingway. \"He got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree. The results include a further erosion of civility, a decrease in Americans’ ability to understand each other and their concerns, and, of all things, President-elect Donald Trump.\" \\nWhich all culminates into the main reason why Trump was elected... \\n7. Americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites. Ben Shapiro explains : \\nTrump won because many Americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as Barack Obama and his Department of Justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country. \\nTrump won because many Americans were sick of watching other Americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance – for their religious beliefs, for their unwillingness to label women men and men women, for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates. \\nTrump won because many Americans were tired of the media’s constant harping on America’s flaws – we were supposedly sexist, racist, and homophobic. Americans said that they did not believe the media, and they were right to do so. \\nIn other words, the left has been tearing down America as a country infested with intolerant, prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives. The people finally had had enough, so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites. Tags '],\n",

       "  'Print \\nIt is rare to see or hear of anyone taking a stand against the rapid increase in legally forced Humanism in public life. Everywhere we look, we see freedom of speech and freedom of religion suppressed to appease a small group of Americans. \\nBut there is hope, as some still know what their duty entails. \\nChristian News reports : \\nAn activist that often works to separate God from the military is seeking the punishment of an Air Force commander who responded to a recent interview question that Jesus is his guide and influences his decisions. \\nOn Sept. 15, the focus was on U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Michael Kersten, who serves with the 39th Medical Support Squadron. The unit provides “preventative and clinical health and wellness services for U.S. and coalition forces.” \\n“Is there a leader from your career that influenced you the most?” he was asked during the interview. “If so, who, and how did they affect the way you lead?” \\n“There’s no ONE in particular, Kersten responded. “As a Christian, my example is to be like Christ. He is my guide and affects all of my decisions. He teaches to do all things as unto the Lord and I believe this is synonymous with integrity first and excellence in all we do.” \\nOf course, atheist troll Mikey Weinstein was very displeased to see such statements on a government website. Therefore, Weinstein wrote to the base commander to have punishment inflicted for such actions. \\nChristian News continued: \\n“He has essentially stated that Christianity (or his particular interpretation/denomination of same) is the guiding policy of HIS command,” Weinstein said. “He has VERY publicly endorsed his singular view of Christian faith supremacy and it is not unreasonable or irrational to think that this widespread endorsement in an official Air Force internet publication could and/or would lead to preferential treatment of those subordinates who share his views.” \\nHe, therefore, demanded that Kertsen be both rebuked and punished. \\n“MRFF demands that you (1) expeditiously and publicly rebuke Lt. Col. Kersten’s official statement—as contrasted with his private Christian faith belief which is not MRFF’s concern—(2) appropriately and visibly punish Lt. Col. Kersten for his unconstitutional and UCMJ-violating behavior; (3) apologize to your airmen and our Turkish allies, and; (4) reaffirm an inclusive 39th Air Base Wing command climate…” Weinstein wrote. \\nIsn’t it cute that he thinks that someone would be scared of his list? Glad to report that Col. John Walker was not. \\nChristian News reports: \\n“The Air Force places the highest value on the rights of its personnel in matters of religion by its members,” he wrote. “Our Airmen are sworn to protect our rights and liberties as Americans, including the right of all Airmen to practice their religious faith of to practice no faith at all.” \\nA second letter has been sent, but, so far, Walker has not replied. \\nIt is possible that he has just chosen to ignore Weinstein. \\nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com shares '],\n",

       " ['Thailand Between the TPP and the EAEU | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: Thailand On February 4th, 2016 the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) was signed. After ratification of the Agreement by all countries, which will take at least two years, a huge free trade zone uniting Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the USA, Vietnam will be formed in the Asia-Pacific region. According to forecasts made by the founders of the TPP, its territory eventually will incorporate up to 25% of world trade. What’s more, the major player there will be the United States and trade will be carried out under their rules. TPP is an attempt by the USA to maintain its economic dominance in the Asia-Pacific region and create a worthy competition to China. In an ideal scenario, the Americans would like to see all the countries of Southeast Asia in the Partnership but so far thing have not run as smoothly as they expected. Currently the only ASEAN members to join the TPP are Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. There is one more candidate from ASEAN: Thailand. However, if it enters into the TPP, then the terms for joining would be different from those which the United States would be like them to be. Thailand expressed its interest in the TPP as early as 2012, when there were preliminary negotiations; however, subsequently it has not taken any steps in this direction. This would not please the Americans, because Thailand is one of their major trading partners. The USA accounts for over 20% of the exports and 14% of the imports of Thailand. That’s a lot of money: the annual imports of Thailand come to about $150 billion. All of these indicators could significantly increase if the country joined the TPP. Let’s not forget about the relatively cheap labour in Thailand that attracts a great deal of foreign investors to its territory. So, it is not surprising, that the USA is very interested in Thailand’s joining the TPP. Japan is also very much interested in this. The Land of the Rising Sun is the second major player in the TPP and the main exporter of products to Thailand. The Japanese share of Thai imports amounts to over 22%. It is well known that there are more than a thousand Japanese or Thai-Japanese Joint Ventures currently operating in Thailand. It is obvious that cooperation with Japan is extremely important to the economy of the Thailand. On February 2, 2016, two days before signing the TPP agreement, Prime Minister of Thailand General Prayut Chan-o-cha met with a delegation of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce headed by its Chairman Akio Mimura. Japanese business representatives addressed the Government of Thailand with a request to join the TPP. They stated that it would significantly contribute to strengthening and developing Thai-Japanese economic cooperation. Meanwhile, the delegates added that they wanted to continue to increase the number of Japanese companies in Thailand as they are satisfied with the tax policy of the country. After the meeting, Prayut Chan-o-cha said that it was very important and it contributed to the growth of trust between the Government of Thailand and Japanese investors. However, after that meeting Thailand still did not join the TPP. Moreover, at that time the Thai Government was already in talks about joining the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), i.e. the association of developed countries of the former Soviet Union, headed by Russia, and one of the potential competitors of the TPP. Incidentally, at that time Vietnam, another important member of ASEAN, which then joined the TPP, had already decided to create a free trade zone with the EAEU. In April 2016 Prayut Chan-o-cha visited Russia. He said Thailand would like to create a free trade zone with the EAEU. In May 2016, Mr. Don Pramudvinai, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the country is ready to join the EAEU. He announced that the Thai Government had considered all the opportunities that the creation of a free trade zone with the EAEU would bring and found them very attractive. Moreover, all EAEU member states would also benefit from this. Besides, Mr. Don Pramudvinai said that Russia will help Thailand to join the EAEU, and that Thailand’s application is already in the preparation stage. It it is worth remembering that Russia is also a major trading partner of Thailand and the annual trade turnover between them is about $4.6 billion. What’s more, there are great prospects for growth; and therefore it is quite possible that Russia and the EAEU may become major partners for Thailand. In conclusion, the Head of the Thai Foreign Ministry said that his country would soon begin direct negotiations on joining the EAEU after settling some internal issues. On June 1st, 2016 the media published a statement made by the Thai Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Somkit Chatusriphithak that Thailand was still ready to join the TPP, but only after a series of public hearings to be held throughout the year. Both supporters and opponents of joining would be given the floor. It was also reported that a Committee headed by the Thai Minister of Commerce, whose aim will be to decide whether membership in the TPP is beneficial to Thailand, will be formed. Then Prayut Chan-o-cha said that it was first necessary to protect the rights of Thai citizens. It is well known that many Thai companies are opposed to joining the TPP, as trade rules imposed by the USA will seriously hurt them. Thai farmers are actively protesting. It is worth taking this into consideration as the agricultural sector employs about 60% of the country’s population. The question of Thailand joining the TPP still remains on the table. It is difficult to regard the statement by the Prime Minister that it will take place a year after the public discussion as a promise. It could be that Thailand is currently seeking to glean as many preferences as possible from the USA and Japan. All the while continuing its rapprochement with the EAEU. If Thailand joins the EAEU and makes it its major partner, the United States and Japan would be faced with big losses. Even if Thailand subsequently joins the TPP as well, the USA would no longer be able to control it completely. The Americans would have to cooperate with Thailand, taking into account its interests; otherwise it would completely turn away from them, and would fully concentrate on the EAEU. It is the same with Vietnam, which has already joined both the TPP and the EAEU. Thailand and Vietnam are among ASEAN’s most developed countries, and if they break with the TPP, the other ASEAN countries may follow. However, control over South-East Asia is necessary for the United States in order to contain China’s economic expansion. Thus, the TPP project is not going as the USA had wanted. They hoped to create a strong economic union where they would run the show. This union was supposed to be a tool for the USA to exert economic and political influence in the Asia-Pacific region, which would lead to weakening China and the EAEU thereby once again becoming the world economic leader. However, it transpired that countries such as Thailand and Vietnam are not a group of states dependent on the United States, but independent trading partners. In all likelihood, the TPP countries can earn good money through mutual trade with each other. However, it seems that the USA will not succeed in gaining global economic dominance through the TPP.

       " ['YouTube censoring videos – on censorship!',\n",
       "  'YouTube censoring videos – on censorship! share in: Education , Google , Journalism YouTube has yet again censored another educational video from Prager University. The content of the banned video? Criticism of censorship; hopefully the irony of their choice to remove it isn’t lost on YouTube’s executives. The video, titled The Dark Art of Political Intimidation, was released last week and features Kimberly Strassel. Strassel is a Wall Street Journal columnist who explains tactics commonly used by the leftists to shut down free speech from the right. This included blackmail, harassment and intimidation. Back in 2010, the IRS started to target conservative non-profit organizations intentionally. Groups were experiencing heavy delays when trying to aquire tax exempt non-profit status. This was an attempt to curb their political involvement in the 2012 election, explained Strassel. A Democratic prosecutor in Wisconsin launched a shadow campaign of financial investigation against conservatives. Their houses were raided before sunrise, with accompanying gag orders to keep them quiet about the raids. The reason for all that was revenge for supporting the Republican Governor Scott Walker. Kimberly Strassel highlights even more examples in the five-minute video showing censorship of political opponents. Youtube placed the video into restricted mode — which is a common filter used by schools, libraries and parents to shield their children from outrageously obscene and graphic content. NewsBusters reports: “Conservative radio host Dennis Prager’s idea for PragerU is to give students alternative, non-progressive takes on history, civics and other issues. there’s no cursing, no violence or any kind of indecency in any of them.” Prager University’s videos including those that have been censored are all G rated. This leaves questions about why the popular video platform is placing restrictions on them. At least 21 additional videos produced by the conservative not for profit educational organization that is Prager University have been placed into restricted mode by Youtube. There is a petition circulating to stop the censorship, which has aquired over 76,000 signatures so far. Hopefully, YouTube will get its act together about restricting videos that pose no threat to children. Better yet, they should make some key changes to their algorithms to prevent this from happening in the future. A Youtube statement given to Wall Street Journal stated, “[V]ideo restrictions are decided by an ‘algorithm’ that factors in ‘community flagging’ and ‘sensitive content.’” Basically progressives tripped the algorithm in an attempt to limit free speech and political involvement from conservatives. YouTube has lifted the restriction on The Dark Art of Political Intimidation this past weekend, thanks to the Wall Street Journal giving them a very hard time over the censorship. Sources: '],\n",

       "  'Prev post Page 1 of 3 Next \\nFor as long as many of us can remember, we have purchased antibacterial hand soap and body washes, believing that were beneficial to our overall health and cleanliness. However, recent research and an order by the FDA seems to show otherwise. It could also show that some of the ingredients in these products could be harmful with long-term use. The findings are causing many of us to rethink what we know about staying clean. \\n“Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” says the director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Dr. Janet Woodcock. “In fact, some data suggests that antibacterial ingredients may do more harm than good over the long-term.” \\nThe Food and Drug Administration recently issued a press release regarding some of the ingredients in common antibacterial hand soaps and body washes. In the statement, the FDA states that they are ordering manufacturers to remove certain ingredients that were originally believed to kill germs. \\nIn the press release, the FDA states , “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today issued a final rule establishing that over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic wash products containing certain active ingredients can no longer be marketed.” \\nThe ruling is regarding an investigation that dates back to 2013 targeting certain ingredients that may be harmful to the public. The FDA had received pressure from environmental groups and law makers regarding these ingredients and the effects they had shown in lab animals. The new ruling applies to 19 different chemical agents found in common antibacterial soaps. The most common of these were triclosan and triclocarban. \\n“Companies will no longer be able to market antibacterial washes with these ingredients because manufacturers did not demonstrate that the ingredients are both safe for long-term daily use and more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of certain infections,” states the press release from the FDA. “Some manufacturers have already started removing these ingredients from their products.” \\nSoap manufacturers will have one year to remove these chemicals and are no longer allowed to market products containing them. This is because the chemicals were found to be either harmful or to provide no additional benefits as washing with regular soap.

       "  'Miley Cyrus Crying Over Trump Victory (Video) 2 shares by Ike Mclean / November 11, 2016 / POLITICS / \\nAfter it was announced that Donald Trump would be the 45 th president of the United States, Miley Cyrus posted a video online of her crying over the results. \\nWith tears rolling down her face Cyrus says, “So, probably like most people—well, maybe not, because given the result—maybe I really am different and maybe a lot of people that I’m surrounded by think with open minds and open hearts like I do. And I do want to say that I’ve been very vocal for my support for everyone besides Donald Trump. Heavily supported Bernie. Heavily supported Hillary. And I still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president, and that’s what makes me so sad.” \\n“I just wish that she had that opportunity. Because she fought for so long and because I believe her when she says that she loves this country. This is all she’s ever done. She’s given her life to make it better. But, like Donald Trump so ironically played after his speech, it said, ‘You can’t always get what you want.’ And happy hippies, we adjust and we accept everyone for who they are. And so Donald Trump, I accept you,” she said. “And this hurts to say, but I even accept you as the President of the United States, and that’s fine…because I think now I want to be hopeful.” \\nShe then went on to thank Barack Obama for “everything he has done the past eight years,” and thanked Hillary “for inspiring us.” \\nThe video of Miley crying can be seen below: \\nSign up to get breaking news alerts from Dennis Michael Lynch.

       " ['The Fatal Expense Of American Imperialism',\n",
       "  ' The Fatal Expense Of American Imperialism\\nBy Jeffrey D. Sachs\\n Boston Globe \" - THE SINGLE MOST important issue in allocating national resources is war versus peace, or as macroeconomists put it, \\x93guns versus butter.\\x94 The United States is getting this choice profoundly wrong, squandering vast sums and undermining national security. In economic and geopolitical terms, America suffers from what Yale historian Paul Kennedy calls \\x93imperial overreach.\\x94 If our next president remains trapped in expensive Middle East wars, the budgetary costs alone could derail any hopes for solving our vast domestic problems.\\nIt may seem tendentious to call America an empire, but the term fits certain realities of US power and how it\\x92s used. An empire is a group of territories under a single power. Nineteenth-century Britain was obviously an empire when it ruled India, Egypt, and dozens of other colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The United States directly rules only a handful of conquered islands (Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands), but it stations troops and has used force to influence who governs in dozens of other sovereign countries. That grip on power beyond America\\x92s own shores is now weakening.\\nThe scale of US military operations is remarkable. The US Department of Defense has (as of a 2010 inventory) 4,999 military facilities, of which 4,249 are in the United States; 88 are in overseas US territories; and 662 are in 36 foreign countries and foreign territories, in all regions of the world. Not counted in this list are the secret facilities of the US intelligence agencies. The cost of running these military operations and the wars they support is extraordinary, around $900 billion per year, or 5 percent of US national income, when one adds the budgets of the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies, homeland security, nuclear weapons programs in the Department of Energy, and veterans benefits. The $900 billion in annual spending is roughly one-quarter of all federal government outlays.\\nThe United States has a long history of using covert and overt means to overthrow governments deemed to be unfriendly to US interests, following the classic imperial strategy of rule through locally imposed friendly regimes. In a powerful study of Latin America between 1898 and 1994, for example, historian John Coatsworth counts 41 cases of \\x93successful\\x94 US-led regime change, for an average rate of one government overthrow by the United States every 28 months for a century. And note: Coatsworth\\x92s count does not include the failed attempts, such as the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.\\nThis tradition of US-led regime change has been part and parcel of US foreign policy in other parts of the world, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Wars of regime change are costly to the United States, and often devastating to the countries involved. Two major studies have measured the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. One, by my Columbia colleague Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard scholar Linda Bilmes, arrived at the cost of $3 trillion as of 2008. A more recent study, by the Cost of War Project at Brown University, puts the price tag at $4.7 trillion through 2016. Over a 15-year period, the $4.7 trillion amounts to roughly $300 billion per year, and is more than the combined total outlays from 2001 to 2016 for the federal departments of education, energy, labor, interior, and transportation, and the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency.\\nIt is nearly a truism that US wars of regime change have rarely served America\\x92s security needs. Even when the wars succeed in overthrowing a government, as in the case of the Taliban in Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Moammar Khadafy in Libya, the result is rarely a stable government, and is more often a civil war. A \\x93successful\\x94 regime change often lights a long fuse leading to a future explosion, such as the 1953 overthrow of Iran\\x92s democratically elected government and installation of the autocratic Shah of Iran, which was followed by the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In many other cases, such as the US attempts (with Saudi Arabia and Turkey) to overthrow Syria\\x92s Bashar al-Assad, the result is a bloodbath and military standoff rather than an overthrow of the government.\\nWHAT IS THE DEEP motivation for these profligate wars and for the far-flung military bases that support them?\\nFrom 1950 to 1990, the superficial answer would have been the Cold War. Yet America\\x92s imperial behavior overseas predates the Cold War by half a century (back to the Spanish-American War, in 1898) and has outlasted it by another quarter century. America\\x92s overseas imperial adventures began after the Civil War and the final conquests of the Native American nations. At that point, US political and business leaders sought to join the European empires \\x97 especially Britain, France, Russia, and the newly emergent Germany \\x97 in overseas conquests. In short order, America grabbed the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, and Hawaii, and joined the European imperial powers in knocking on the doors of China.\\nAs of the 1890s, the United States was by far the world\\x92s largest economy, but until World War II, it took a back seat to the British Empire in global naval power, imperial reach, and geopolitical dominance. The British were the unrivaled masters of regime change \\x97 for example, in carving up the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. Yet the exhaustion from two world wars and the Great Depression ended the British and French empires after World War II and thrust the United States and Russia into the forefront as the two main global empires. The Cold War had begun.\\nThe economic underpinning of America\\x92s global reach was unprecedented. As of 1950, US output constituted a remarkable 27 percent of global output, with the Soviet Union roughly a third of that, around 10 percent. The Cold War fed two fundamental ideas that would shape American foreign policy till now. The first was that the United States was in a struggle for survival against the Soviet empire. The second was that every country, no matter how remote, was a battlefield in that global war. While the United States and the Soviet Union would avoid a direct confrontation, they flexed their muscles in hot wars around the world that served as proxies for the superpower competition.\\nOver the course of nearly a half century, Cuba, Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Iran, Namibia, Mozambique, Chile, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and even tiny Granada, among many others, were interpreted by US strategists as battlegrounds with the Soviet empire. Often, far more prosaic interests were involved. Private companies like United Fruit International and ITT convinced friends in high places (most famously the Dulles brothers, Secretary of State John Foster and CIA director Allen) that land reforms or threatened expropriations of corporate assets were dire threats to US interests, and therefore in need of US-led regime change. Oil interests in the Middle East were another repeated cause of war, as had been the case for the British Empire from the 1920s.\\nThese wars destabilized and impoverished the countries involved rather than settling the politics in America\\x92s favor. The wars of regime change were, with few exceptions, a litany of foreign policy failure. They were also extraordinarily costly for the United States itself. The Vietnam War was of course the greatest of the debacles, so expensive, so bloody, and so controversial that it crowded out Lyndon Johnson\\x92s other, far more important and promising war, the War on Poverty, in the United States.\\nThe end of the Cold War, in 1991, should have been the occasion for a fundamental reorientation of US guns-versus-butter policies. The occasion offered the United States and the world a \\x93peace dividend,\\x94 the opportunity to reorient the world and US economy from war footing to sustainable development. Indeed, the Rio Earth Summit, in 1992, established sustainable development as the centerpiece of global cooperation, or so it seemed.\\nAlas, the blinders and arrogance of American imperial thinking prevented the United States from settling down to a new era of peace. As the Cold War was ending, the United States was beginning a new era of wars, this time in the Middle East. The United States would sweep away the Soviet-backed regimes in the Middle East and establish unrivalled US political dominance. Or at least that was the plan.\\nTHE QUARTER CENTURY since 1991 has therefore been marked by a perpetual US war in the Middle East, one that has destabilized the region, massively diverted resources away from civilian needs toward the military, and helped to create mass budget deficits and the buildup of public debt. The imperial thinking has led to wars of regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Syria, across four presidencies: George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The same thinking has induced the United States to expand NATO to Russia\\x92s borders, despite the fact that NATO\\x92s supposed purpose was to defend against an adversary \\x97 the Soviet Union \\x97 that no longer exists. Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev has emphasized that eastward NATO expansion \\x93was certainly a violation of the spirit of those declarations and assurances that we were given in 1990,\\x94 regarding the future of East-West security.\\nThere is a major economic difference, however, between now and 1991, much less 1950. At the start of the Cold War, in 1950, the United States produced around 27 percent of world output. As of 1991, when the Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz dreams of US dominance were taking shape, the United States accounted for around 22 percent of world production. By now, according to IMF estimates, the US share is 16 percent, while China has surpassed the United States, at around 18 percent. By 2021, according to projections by the International Monetary Fund, the United States will produce roughly 15 percent of global output compared with China\\x92s 20 percent. The United States is incurring massive public debt and cutting back on urgent public investments at home in order to sustain a dysfunctional, militarized, and costly foreign policy.\\nThus comes a fundamental choice. The United States can vainly continue the neoconservative project of unipolar dominance, even as the recent failures in the Middle East and America\\x92s declining economic preeminence guarantee the ultimate failure of this imperial vision. If, as some neoconservatives support, the United States now engages in an arms race with China, we are bound to come up short in a decade or two, if not sooner. The costly wars in the Middle East \\x97 even if continued much less enlarged in a Hillary Clinton presidency \\x97 could easily end any realistic hopes for a new era of scaled-up federal investments in education, workforce training, infrastructure, science and technology, and the environment.\\nThe far smarter approach will be to maintain America\\x92s defensive capabilities but end its imperial pretensions. This, in practice, means cutting back on the far-flung network of military bases, ending wars of regime change, avoiding a new arms race (especially in next-generation nuclear weapons), and engaging China, India, Russia, and other regional powers in stepped-up diplomacy through the United Nations, especially through shared actions on the UN\\x92s Sustainable Development Goals, including climate change, disease control, and global education.\\nMany American conservatives will sneer at the very thought that the United States\\x92 room for maneuver should be limited in the slightest by the UN. But think how much better off the United States would be today had it heeded the UN Security Council\\x92s wise opposition to the wars of regime change in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Many conservatives will point to Vladimir Putin\\x92s actions in Crimea as proof that diplomacy with Russia is useless, without recognizing that it was NATO\\x92s expansion to the Baltics and its 2008 invitation to Ukraine to join NATO, that was a primary trigger of Putin\\x92s response.\\nIn the end, the Soviet Union bankrupted itself through costly foreign adventures such as the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and its vast over-investment in the military. Today the United States has similarly over-invested in the military, and could follow a similar path to decline if it continues the wars in the Middle East and invites an arms race with China. It\\x92s time to abandon the reveries, burdens, and self-deceptions of empire and to invest in sustainable development at home and in partnership with the rest of the world.\\nJeffrey D.

       "  'Home / News / FOR SALE: Hillary’s State Department FOR SALE: Hillary’s State Department fisher 8 mins ago News Comments Off on FOR SALE: Hillary’s State Department FOR SALE: Hillary ‘s State Department \\nAs new revelations continue to unfold regarding Hillary ’s time as Secretary of State, it has become clear that her State Department was highly influenced by donors to the Clinton Foundation. Before Hillary became Secretary of State, she had to sign an agreement with the Obama administration restricting the ability of the Clinton Foundation to accept foreign donations. In February of this year the Clinton Foundation admitted that the agreement had in fact been broken. \\nNow it has been discovered that over half of non-government officials who met with Hillary while she was Secretary of State gave money to the Clinton Foundation. What they received in return is just one of the questions Hillary has refused to answer byavoiding the press for the past eight months. In newly released emails there are details of donors being granted access to ambassadors due to their interest in the region, the Foundation putting pressure on Hillary ’s staff to hire a former employee, and the Clinton Global Initiative leader demanding a top Foundation donor be connected with the State Department. \\nThis is beyond the appearance of a conflict and Americans have seen through the facade. A majority of voters say they believe Clinton gave special treatment to Foundation donors while she was Secretary of State. As the president of Judicial Watch accurately pointed out, “There was no daylight between the two under Mrs. Clinton, and this was contrary to her promises.” \\nAfter ignoring previous ethics guidelines, the Clintons are now trying to reassure Americans by saying the Foundation will change if Hillary is elected. The last ditch effort to gloss over ethics violations and possibly cover up corruption within Hillary ’s State Department is much too little and far too late. Americans are tired of being lied to by the Clintons. Since the American people have a right to a full view of Hillary ’s record before they head to the polls, the Clinton Foundation should immediately release all of Hillary ’s State Department emails.

       "  ' America\\x92s Rocky Road to Raqqa\\nThough the U.S. has no legal right to operate inside Syria, Official Washington is boasting about its plans to liberate Raqqa from ISIS. But another problem: the battle plan makes no sense, says Daniel Lazare. By Daniel Lazare\\n \" Consortium News \" - In her final debate with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton promised that the United States and its allies would follow up the offensive against ISIS-occupied Mosul with an assault on ISIS headquarters in Raqqa in neighboring Syria. Last week, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter assured the press that an offensive was on the way.\\n\\x93It starts in the next few weeks,\\x94 Carter said . \\x93That has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both,\\x94 i.e. dual assaults on Mosul and Raqqa.\\n\\x93We think this is the right moment to begin pushing in Raqqa,\\x94 a Pentagon spokesman added on Monday. \\x93There is a plan in place to begin this.\\x94\\nExcept that the more the administration assures the public that an assault is just around the corner, the more distant it seems to become. In fact, it looks more and more like an assault on Raqqa won\\x92t occur at all. The reason is simple. The strategy is half-baked even by U.S. standards.\\nThe effort to take back Mosul is off to a dangerous enough start as it is. The problem is not the military campaign, which seems to be making good progress as Iraqi troops enter the city for the first time in two years . Rather, it is the larger political setting.\\nPowerful cross-currents are at work involving the Iraqi army, Turkey, Iranian-backed Shi\\x91ite militias known as Popular Mobilization Forces, or Al-Hashd al-Shaabi, and the Kurdish Peshmerga. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\\x92s neo-Ottoman president, has unsettled the Iraqis by claiming that Mosul lies within his country\\x92s traditional sphere of influence and by vowing to protect the city\\x92s Sunni population against revenge by Al-Hashd for anti-Shi\\x91ite atrocities committed by ISIS (also known as ISIL, Islamic State, and Daesh).\\nUnfortunately, Erdogan\\x92s fears are not unfounded since Al-Hashd has already been accused of atrocities in Tikrit and Fallujah while at least one militia leader has sworn to take vengeance in Mosul as well. [See Consortiumnews.com\\x92s \\x93 Clinton\\x92s Slog Deeper into the Big Muddy .\\x94]\\nAlthough the Iraqi government has promised that the militias will confine their activities to the city\\x92s outskirts, the Iraqi army is seen as hardly less threatening since its Shi\\x91ite flags are now ubiquitous . Mosul residents also feel threatened by the Kurds since they remember all too well when the Peshmerga took over in the wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion, sparking a wave of looting that stripped the city clean .\\nShi\\x91ite militia members similarly remember when they clashed with the Kurds in the central Iraqi town of Tuz Khurma as recently as April and are leery of coming into contact with them as well.\\nLeery \\x91Allies\\x92\\nSo everyone is leery of everyone else, which means that the more such forces converge on Mosul, the greater the risk that years of accumulated fears and hatreds will reach a critical mass and explode.\\nErdogan is meanwhile refusing to abandon a military beachhead that he maintains in the small town of Bashiqa a few miles to the northeast, while Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is threatening that Turkey will be \\x93 dismantled \\x94 if it tries to mount a full-scale invasion.\\n\\x93We do not want war with Turkey,\\x94 Abadi said, \\x93and we do not want a confrontation with Turkey. But if a confrontation happens, we are ready for it. We will consider [Turkey] an enemy and we will deal with it as an enemy.\\x94\\nTurkey\\x92s reply has been to continue massing troops, tanks, and other military hardware on the Iraqi border just 90 miles to the north. On Wednesday, it piled on yet more abuse as Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu demanded of Abadi, \\x93If you have the strength, why did you surrender Mosul to terror organizations?\\x94\\nBut as dangerous as all this is, the situation some 280 miles to the west around Raqqa in Syria is even worse. As the U.S. tries to assemble a force capable of taking on ISIS, it finds itself picking its way through a list of contenders that is little short of dizzying.\\nIn addition to Syria, Russia and Turkey, the list includes the so-called Free Syrian Army; Kurdish People\\x92s Protection Units known as the YPG; Sunni Arabs who have joined with the YPG in an umbrella federation known as the Syrian Democratic Forces or SDF; plus the same Iranian-backed Shi\\x91ite militias in Iraq that have lately begun threatening to cross the border and join in the assault on Raqqa as well.\\nAlso dizzying are the local animosities. While Turkey gets along well with Masoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish autonomous zone in northern Iraq, the story is very different in northern Syria, where the left-leaning YPG is dominant. Since the YPG\\x92s parent body, the Kurdish Democratic Union, is allied with the Kurdistan Workers\\x92 Party (PKK), which has been leading an insurgency inside Turkey since the 1980s, Erdogan sees the militia as no better than Islamic State and possibly even worse.\\nThe YPG feels the same way, describing Erdogan and ISIS as nothing less than brothers under the skin. The YPG is hostile to the Free Syrian Army since it took part in last summer\\x92s Turkish incursion into northern Syria, whose primary goal was to prevent Kurdish militia units in northeastern Syria from hooking up with fellow YPG fighters in the northwest. The FSA, meanwhile, is not only anti-YPG but anti-U.S. even though its Turkish sponsors are nominally pro.\\nThus, Free Syrian Army members erupted in anti-American chanting when a convoy of U.S. commandoes showed up in the Turkish-occupied town of Al-Rai in mid-September, forcing the Americans to flee .\\n\\x93Christians and Americans have no place among us,\\x94 one militant shouted . \\x93They want to wage a crusader war to occupy Syria.\\x94 Another called out: \\x93The collaborators of America are dogs and pigs. They wage a crusader war against Syria and Islam.\\x94\\nThis is one of the groups that Washington classifies as \\x93secular\\x94 and \\x93moderate.\\x94 Still, Washington\\x92s hope is that the various factions will put their differences aside long enough to \\x93liberate\\x94 Raqqa. The prospect seems unlikely especially since fighting between the Turkish-backed FSA and the YPG seems to be spreading.\\nTurkey Killing Kurds\\nOn Oct. 20, Turkish jets and artillery pounded YPG-SDF positions northeast of Aleppo, killing as many as 200 fighters. Since then, the two groups \\x96 Turkey and the Free Syrian Army on one side, the YPG and anti-Turkish Arabs of the SDF on the other \\x96 have been engaged in a struggle for control of ISIS-occupied Al-Bab, 20 miles or so south of the Turkish border and roughly the same distance northeast of Aleppo.\\nIf Turkish-FSA forces take Al-Bab, then Kurdish hopes of linking up their forces in northeastern and northwestern Syria will have been dashed. The FSA would then be in a position to push east to Raqqa, which would mean a clash with both the main body of the YPG and ISIS. Or, as the often perceptive Moon of Alabama website suggests , it could instead wheel about and attempt to relieve its fellow Salafists besieged in Aleppo.\\nThat would mean a head-on collision with Syrian government forces and exposure to Russian jets, a point that a Syrian government helicopter drove home last week by bombing Turkish-FSA forces engaged in combat with the YPG.\\nInternecine warfare like this can only benefit Islamic State, an undisputed expert at using its opponents\\x92 differences to its own advantage. This is why it was able to put down roots in Syria in the first place \\x96 because the U.S. was too busy trying to topple Bashar al-Assad to worry about an Al Qaeda offshoot that Obama famously dismissed as nothing more than \\x93 a JV team .\\x94\\nIt\\x92s also why Islamic State was able to establish bases and supply lines in Turkey \\x96 because Erdogan was more concerned with fighting Assad and the Kurds to concern himself with what his fellow Sunnis were up to. A northern Syrian and Iraqi landscape torn by infighting is perfect for a hyper-violent Sunni-Salafist group skilled at playing one group off against another.\\nThe White House dimly senses that it has gotten itself into a mess, which is why officials turn vague and inscrutable whenever reporters press for details concerning a reported assault on Raqqa. The problem, as the U.S. officials see it, is that Erdogan remains unalterably opposed to the YPG-SDF even though it is the only ground force capable of fighting Islamic State. Hence, it is impossible to take Raqqa without alienating a fellow member of NATO.\\n\\x93We do not need terrorist organizations like the PYD-YPG,\\x94 Erdogan says he told Obama in an Oct. 26 phone call , referring to the militia and Kurdish Democratic Union. \\x93I said, \\x91Come, let\\x92s remove [Islamic State] from Raqqa together. We will sort this out together with you.\\x92 We have the strength.\\x94\\nThe U.S. doubts that Erdogan does have that capability yet is unable to say no. The upshot is talks, negotiations, and growing delays. Jennifer Cafarella, a Syria expert at the neocon Institute for the Study of War, grouses that the administration is \\x93stalling\\x94 while, on the other side of the debate, foreign-policy \\x93realists\\x94 wonder why the administration is rushing ahead with a strategy that it knows won\\x92t work.\\nSkeptical Analysis\\nIn a hard-hitting analysis in the conservative but often skeptical National Interest, Daniel L. Davis, a retired army colonel and Afghan veteran, points out that whereas a national army, well-armed militias, U.S. ground and intelligence forces, and \\x93resupply lines through friendly territory\\x94 are all in place in northern Iraq, \\x93none of those things exist\\x94 with regard to Raqqa. The political problems, he adds, are even more daunting.\\nWhen Kurdish units liberated the ISIS-occupied town of Manbij in August, Davis notes, grateful residents told YPG members, \\x93You are our children, you are our heroes, you are the blood of our hearts.\\x94 Yet the YPG\\x92s reward was to be denounced as terrorists by Erdogan and instructed to leave by the U.S.\\n\\x93What possible assurances could the United States give to the Kurds,\\x94 Davis writes, \\x93that upon successful liberation of Raqqa, the Turkish army isn\\x92t going to turn on them? Why would the Turks bomb the Kurdish troops one day and then work with them the next, or allow the Kurds to maintain a presence after liberating Raqqa? There is no recognizable logic in these unsubstantiated hopes.\\x94\\nDavis is correct. But, then, there is no recognizable logic in the Obama administration\\x92s intervention in Syria in general. Why insist that Assad step down, for example, when the only effect will be to clear a path for Al Qaeda and Islamic State straight through to the presidential palace in Damascus?\\nWhy back a Turkish incursion into northern Syria when the only result is to infuriate Kurds who are the only effective anti-ISIS fighting force that the U.S. has on its side? Why insist that the U.S. wants a democratic solution to the Syrian civil war when the countries backing the anti-Assad forces, i.e. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil monarchies, are some of the most undemocratic societies on earth?\\nNone of it makes sense. But since the Israelis, Turks and Saudis all want Assad to go, the Obama administration feels that it has no choice but to comply. How else can it keep a fractious empire together if not by catering to its client states\\x92 whims and desires?\\nWhen empires are strong, they can afford to say no. But when they are weak and over-extended, they do as they are told. This is why the U.S. is frozen with regard to Raqqa. It can\\x92t disappoint its allies by calling an assault off, and it can\\x92t push ahead with a plan that doesn\\x92t add up. So it dawdles.\\nDaniel Lazare is the author of several books including The Frozen Republic: How the Constitution Is Paralyzing Democracy (Harcourt Brace).\\nSyria\\'s U.S.-backed SDF says no to Turkish role in Raqqa operation : \"The Syrian Democratic Forces are the only force that will take part in the operation to liberate Raqqa and we informed the (international U.S.-led) coalition forces that we reject any Turkish role in the Raqqa liberation operation,\"\\nSIL chief threatens Turkey : Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who is reportedly hiding out in the besieged city of Mosul, released his first message since 2015, urging followers to wage all-out war and take the fighting into Saudi Arabia and Turkey.'],\n",

       "  ' Trump in the White House By Noam Chomsky\\nNovember 14, CJ Polychroniou : Noam, the unthinkable has happened: in contrast to all forecasts, Donald Trump scored a decisive victory over Hillary Clinton and the man that Michael Moore described as \\x93wretched, ignorant, dangerous part-time clown and full-time sociopath\\x94 is the next president of the United States. In your view, what were the deciding factors that led American voters produce the biggest upset in the history of US politics?\\nNoam Chomsky : Before turning to this question, I think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on November 8, a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human history, depending on how we react.\\nNo exaggeration.\\nThe most important news of November 8 was barely noted, a fact of some significance in itself.\\nOn November 8, the World Meteorological Organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in Morocco, COP22, which was called in order to carry forward the Paris agreements of COP21. The WMO reported that the past five years were the hottest on record. It reported rising sea levels, soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar ice, most ominously the huge Antarctic glaciers. Already Arctic sea ice over the past five years is 28 percent below the average of the previous 29 years, not only raising sea levels but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar rays, thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming. The WMO reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by COP21, along with other dire reports and forecasts.\\nAnother event took place on November 8, which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons that, once again, were barely noted.\\nOn November 8, the most powerful country in world history, which will set its stamp on what comes next, had an election. The outcome placed total control of the government \\x96 the executive, Congress, the Supreme Court \\x96 in the hands of the Republican Party, the most dangerous organization in world history.\\nApart from the last phrase, all of this is uncontroversial. The last phrase may seem outlandish, even outrageous. But is it? The facts suggest otherwise. The Party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life. There is no historical precedent for such a stand.\\nIs this an exaggeration? Consider what we have just been witnessing.\\nDuring the Republican primaries, every candidate denied that what is happening is happening \\x96 with the exception of the sensible moderates, like Jeb Bush, who said it\\x92s all uncertain but we don\\x92t have to do anything because we\\x92re producing more natural gas, thanks to fracking. Or John Kasich, who agreed that global warming is taking place but added that \\x93we are going to burn [coal] in Ohio and we are not going to apologize for it.\\x94 The winning candidate, now the President-elect, calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels, including coal; dismantling of regulations; rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy; and in general racing to the cliff as fast as possible.\\nTrump has already taken steps to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency by placing in charge of the EPA transition a notorious (and proud) climate change denier, Myron Ebell. Trump\\x92s top adviser on energy, billionaire oil executive Harold Hamm, announced his expectations, which were predictable: dismantling regulations, tax cuts for the industry (and the wealthy and corporate sector generally), more fossil fuel production, lifting Obama\\x92s temporary block on the Dakota Access pipeline. The market reacted quickly. Shares in energy corporations boomed, including the world\\x92s largest coal miner, Peabody Energy, which had filed for bankruptcy, but after Trump\\x92s victory registered a 50% gain.\\nThe effects of Republican denialism had already been felt. There had been hopes that the COP21 Paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty, but any such thoughts were abandoned because the Republican Congress would not accept any binding commitments, so what emerged was a voluntary agreement, evidently much weaker.\\nEffects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are. In Bangladesh alone, tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low-lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather, creating a migrant crisis that will make today\\x92s pale into insignificance. With considerable justice, Bangladesh\\x92s leading climate scientist says that \\x93These migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming. Millions should be able to go to the United States.\\x94 And to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era, the Anthropocene, marked by radical human transformation of the environment. These catastrophic consequences can only increase, not just in Bangladesh but in all of South Asia as temperatures, already intolerable for the poor, inexorably rise and the Himalayan glaciers melt, threatening the entire water supply. Already in India some 300 million people are reported to lack drinking water. And the effects will reach far beyond.\\nIt is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history \\x96 whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know \\x96 and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster. Similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival, the threat of nuclear destruction that has been looming over our heads for 70 years, and is now increasing.\\nIt is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral extravaganza, none of this receives more than passing mention. At least I am at a loss to find appropriate words.\\nTurning finally to the question raised, to be precise it appears that Clinton received a slight majority of the vote. The apparent decisive victory has to do with curious features of American politics: among other factors, the electoral college residue of the founding of the country as an alliance of separate states; the winner-take-all system in each state; arrangement of congressional districts (sometimes by gerrymandering) to provide greater weight to rural votes (in past elections, probably this one too, Democrats have had a comfortable margin of victory in popular vote for the House but hold a minority of seats); the very high rate of abstention (usually close to half in presidential elections, this one too). Of some significance for the future is the fact that in the 18-25 range, Clinton won handily, and Sanders had an even higher level of support. How much this matters depends on what kind of future humanity will face.\\nAccording to current information, Trump broke all records in the support he received from white voters, working class and lower middle class, particularly in the $50,000 to $90,000 income range, rural and suburban, primarily those without college education. These groups share the anger throughout the West at the centrist establishment, revealed as well in the unanticipated Brexit vote and the collapse of centrist parties in continental Europe. The angry and disaffected are victims of the neoliberal policies of the past generation, the policies described in congressional testimony by Fed chair Alan Greenspan \\x96 St. Alan as he was called reverentially by the economics profession and other admirers until the miraculous economy he was supervising crashed in 2007-8, threatening to bring the whole world economy down with it. As Greenspan explained during his glory days, his successes in economic management were based substantially on \\x93growing worker insecurity.\\x94 Intimidated working people would not ask for higher wages, benefits, and security but would be satisfied with the stagnating wages and reduced benefits that signal a healthy economy by neoliberal standards.\\nWorking people who have been the subjects of these experiments in economic theory are, oddly, not particularly happy about the outcome. They are not, for example, overjoyed at the fact that in 2007, at the peak of the neoliberal miracle, real wages for non-supervisory workers were lower than they had been years earlier, or that real wages for male workers are about at 1960s levels while spectacular gains have gone to the pockets of a very few at the top, disproportionately a fraction of 1%. Not the result of market forces, achievement, or merit, but rather of definite policy decisions, matters reviewed carefully by economist Dean Baker in recently published work.\\nThe fate of the minimum wage illustrates what has been happening. Through the periods of high and egalitarian growth in the \\x9150s and \\x9160s, the minimum wage \\x96 which sets a floor for other wages \\x96 tracked productivity. That ended with the onset of neoliberal doctrine. Since then the minimum wage has stagnated (in real value). Had it continued as before, it would probably be close to $20 per hour. Today it is considered a political revolution to raise it to $15.\\nWith all the talk of near-full employment today, labor force participation remains below the earlier norm. And for a working man, there is a great difference between a steady job in manufacturing with union wages and benefits, as in earlier years, and a temporary job with little security in some service profession. Apart from wages, benefits, and security, there is a loss of dignity, of hope for the future, of a sense that this is a world in which I belong and play a worthwhile role.\\nThe impact is captured well in Arlie Hochschild\\x92s sensitive and illuminating portrayal of a Trump stronghold in Louisiana, where she lived and worked for many years. She uses the image of a line in which these people are standing, expecting to move forward steadily as they work hard and keep to all the conventional values. But their position in the line has stalled. Ahead of them, they see people leaping forward, but that does not cause much distress, because it is \\x93the American way\\x94 for (alleged) merit to be rewarded. What does cause real distress is what is happening behind them. Undeserving people who do not follow the rules are being moved in front of them by federal government programs designed to benefit African-Americans, immigrants, and others they often regard with contempt. All of this is exacerbated by Reagan\\x92s racist fabrications about strapping young bucks and welfare queens (by implication Black) stealing your hard-earned money, and other fantasies \\x97 which are sometimes tinged with shreds of reality, as is usually the case with ugly and dangerous concoctions designed to deflect attention from the real agents of distress to easy scapegoats.\\nSometimes failure to explain, itself a form of contempt, plays a role. I once met a house painter in Boston who had turned bitterly against the evil government after a Washington bureaucrat who knew nothing about painting organized a meeting of painting contractors to inform them that they could no longer use lead paint, the only kind that works, as they all knew but the suit didn\\x92t understand. That destroyed his small business, compelling him to paint houses on his own with substandard stuff forced on him by government elites. Sometimes there are also some reasons. Hochschild describes a man whose family and friends are suffering bitterly from the lethal effects of chemical pollution but who despises the government, and the \\x93liberal elites,\\x94 because for him, the EPA means some ignorant guy who tells him he can\\x92t fish but does nothing about the chemical plants.\\nThese are just samples of the real lives of Trump supporters, who are deluded to believe that Trump will do something to remedy their plight, though the merest look at his fiscal and other proposals demonstrates the opposite \\x96 posing a task for activists who hope to fend off the worst and to advance desperately needed changes.\\nExit polls reveal that the passionate support for Trump was inspired primarily by the belief that he represented change, while Clinton was perceived as the candidate who would perpetuate their distress. The \\x93change\\x94 that Trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse, but it is understandable that the consequences are not clear to isolated people in an atomized society lacking the kinds of associations (like unions) that can educate and organize. That is a crucial difference between today\\x92s despair and the generally hopeful attitudes of many working people under much greater duress during the great depression of the 1930s.\\nThere are other factors in Trump\\x92s success. Comparative studies show that doctrines of White Supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on American culture than in South Africa, and it\\x92s no secret that the white population is declining. In a decade or two whites are projected to be a minority of the work force, and not too much later a minority of the population. The traditional conservative culture is also perceived as under attack by the successes of \\x93identity politics,\\x94 regarded as the province of elites who have only contempt for hard-working patriotic church-going Americans with real family values whose country is disappearing before their eyes.\\nIt is worth remembering that before World War II, though it had long been the richest country in the world, the US was not a major player in global affairs and was also something of a cultural backwater. Someone who wanted to study physics would go to Germany. An aspiring writer or artist would go to Paris. That changed radically with World War II, for obvious reasons, but only for part of the population. Much remained culturally traditional. To mention one example of great significance, one of the difficulties in raising public concern over the very severe threats of global warming is that 40% of the population do not see why it is a problem, since Christ is returning in a few decades. About the same percentage believe that the world was created a few thousand years ago. If science conflicts with the Bible, so much the worse for science. It would be hard to find an analogue in other societies.\\nThe Democratic party abandoned any real concern for working people by the 1970s, and they have therefore been drawn to the ranks of their bitter class enemies, who at least pretend to speak their language \\x96 Reagan\\x92s folksy style with little jokes while eating jelly beans, W. Bush\\x92s carefully cultivated image of a regular guy you could meet in a bar who loved to cut brush on the ranch in 100 degree heat and his probably faked mispronunciations (it\\x92s unlikely that he talked like that at Yale), and now Trump, who gives voice to people with legitimate grievances who have lost not just jobs but also a sense of personal self-worth; and who rails against the government that they perceive as having undermined their lives (not without reason).\\nOne of the great achievements of the doctrinal system has been to divert anger from the corporate sector to the government that implements the programs it designs, such as the highly protectionist corporate/investor rights agreements that are uniformly mis-described as \\x93free trade agreements\\x94 in the media and commentary. With all its flaws, the government is to some extent under popular influence and control, unlike the corporate sector. It is highly advantageous for the business world to foster hatred for pointy-headed government bureaucrats and to drive out of people\\x92s minds the subversive idea that the government might become an instrument of popular will, a government of, by, and for the people.\\nIs Trump representing a new movement in American politics, or was the outcome of this election primarily a rejection of Hillary Clinton by voters who hate the Clintons and are fed-up with \\x93politics as usual?\\x94\\nIt\\x92s by no means new. Both political parties have moved to the right during the neoliberal period. Today\\x92s New Democrats are pretty much what used to be called \\x93moderate Republicans.\\x94 The \\x93political revolution\\x94 that Bernie Sanders called for, rightly, would not have greatly surprised Dwight Eisenhower. The Republicans have moved so far to dedication to the wealthy and the corporate sector that they cannot hope to get votes on their actual programs, and have turned to mobilizing sectors of the population that have always been there but not as an organized political force: evangelicals, nativists, racists, and the victims of the forms of globalization designed to set working people around the world in competition with one another while protecting the privileged and undermining the legal and other measures that provided working people with some protection and with ways to influence decision-making in the closely linked public and private sectors, notably with effective labor unions.\\nThe consequences have been evident in recent Republican primaries. Every candidate that has emerged from the base \\x96 Bachmann, Cain, Santorum, \\x97 has been so extreme that the Republican establishment had to use its ample resources to beat them down. The difference in 2016 is that the establishment failed, much to its chagrin, as we have seen.\\nDeservedly or not, Clinton represented the policies that were feared and hated while Trump was seen as the symbol of \\x93change\\x94 \\x96 change of what kind requires a careful look at his actual proposals, something largely missing in what reached the public. The campaign itself was remarkable in its avoidance of issues, and media commentary generally complied, keeping to the concept that true objectivity means reporting accurately what is \\x93within the beltway\\x94 but not venturing beyond.\\nTrump said following the outcome of the election that he \\x93will represent all Americans.\\x94 How is be going to do that when the nation is so divided and he has already expressed deep hatred for many groups in the United States, including women and minorities? Do you see any resemblance between Brexit and Donald Trump\\x92s victory?\\nThere are definite similarities to Brexit, and also to the rise of the ultranationalist far-right parties in Europe \\x96 whose leaders were quick to congratulate Trump on his victory, perceiving him as one of their own: Farrage, Le Pen, Orban, and others like them. And these developments are quite frightening. A look at the polls in Austria and Germany \\x96 Austria and Germany \\x96 cannot fail to evoke unpleasant memories for those familiar with the 1930s, even more so for those who watched directly, as I did as a child. I can still recall listening to Hitler\\x92s speeches, not understanding the words though the tone and audience reaction were chilling enough. The first article that I remember writing was in February 1939, after the fall of Barcelona, on the seemingly inexorable spread of the fascist plague. And by strange coincidence, it was in Barcelona that my wife and I watched Tuesday\\x92s events.\\nAs to how Trump will handle what he has brought forth \\x96 not created, but brought forth \\x96 we cannot say. Perhaps his most striking characteristic is unpredictability. A lot will depend on the reactions of those appalled by his performance and the visions he has projected, such as they are.\\nTrump has no identifiable political ideology guiding his stance on economic, social, and political issues, yet there are clear authoritarian tendencies in his behavior. Therefore, do you find any validity behind the claims that Trump may represent the emergence of \\x93fascism with a friendly face?\\x94 in the United States?\\nFor many years I have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the United States, someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society, and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets. That could indeed lead to what sociologist Bertram Gross called \\x93friendly fascism\\x94 in a perceptive study 35 years ago. But that requires an honest ideologue, a Hitler type, not someone whose only detectable ideology is Me. The dangers however have been real for many years, perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that Trump has unleashed.\\nWith the Republicans in the White House, but also controlling both houses and the future shape of the Supreme Court, what will America look like for at least the next four years?\\nA good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers. Early indications are unattractive, to put it mildly.\\nThe Supreme Court will be in the hands of reactionaries for many years, with predictable consequences. If Trump follows through on his Paul Ryan-style fiscal programs, there will be huge benefits for the very rich \\x96 estimated by the Tax Policy Center as a tax cut of over 14% for the top 0.1% and a substantial cut more generally at the upper end of the income scale, but with virtually no tax relief for others, who will also face major new burdens. The respected economics correspondent of the Financial Times, Martin Wolf, writes that \\x93The tax proposals would shower huge benefits on already rich Americans such as Mr Trump,\\x94 while leaving others in the lurch, including of course his popular constituency. The immediate reaction of the business world reveals that big pharma, Wall Street, military industry, energy industries, and other such wonderful institutions expect a very bright future.\\nOne positive development might be the infrastructure program that Trump has promised while (along with much reporting and commentary) concealing the fact that it is essentially the Obama stimulus program that would have been of great benefit to the economy and to the society generally, but was killed by the Republican Congress on the pretext that it would explode the deficit. While that charge was spurious at the time, given the very low interest rates, it holds in spades for Trump\\x92s program, now accompanied by radical tax cuts for the rich and corporate sector and increased Pentagon spending.\\nThere is, however, an escape, provided by Dick Cheney when he explained to Bush\\x92s Treasury Secretary Paul O\\x92Neill that \\x93Reagan proved that deficits don\\x92t matter\\x94 \\x96 meaning deficits that we Republicans create in order to gain popular support, leaving it to someone else, preferably Democrats, to somehow clean up the mess. The technique might work, for a while at least.\\nThere are also many questions about foreign policy consequences, mostly unanswered.\\nThere is mutual admiration between Trump and Putin. How likely is it therefore that we may see a new era in US-Russia relations?\\nOne hopeful prospect is that there might be reduction of the very dangerous and mounting tensions at the Russian border: note \\x93the Russian border,\\x94 not the Mexican border. Thereby lies a tale that we cannot go into here. It is also possible that Europe might distance itself from Trump\\x92s America, as already suggested by Chancellor Merkel and other European leaders \\x96 and from the British voice of American power, after Brexit. That might possibly lead to European efforts to defuse the tensions, and perhaps even efforts to move towards something like Mikhail Gorbachev\\x92s vision of an integrated Eurasian security system without military alliances, rejected by the US in favor of NATO expansion, a vision revived recently by Putin, whether seriously or not we do not know since the gesture was dismissed.\\nIs US foreign policy under a Trump administration likely to be more or less militaristic than what we have seen under the Obama or even the G.W. Bush administrations?\\nI don\\x92t think one can answer with any confidence. Trump is too unpredictable. There are too many open questions. What we can say is that popular mobilization and activism, properly organized and conducted, can make a large difference.\\nAnd we should bear in mind that the stakes are very large, as I remarked at the outset.'],\n",

       "  \"Share on Twitter \\nFor Robin Roberts, losing her mother while she was in the midst of her own fight for her life was an especially hard blow. Roberts's mother had always been there for her through every illness and injury. \\nWhen she needed her mom the most, however, Roberts swears that she could hear her voice, encouraging her not to give up on life. Image Credit: Mireya Acierto/Getty Images \\nAs PopSugar reports, on a recent episode of “ Harry ,” the “Good Morning America” co-host tearfully recounted the days she spent in the hospital after a bone marrow transplant. Famously open about her battles with breast cancer and a rare bone marrow disease, Roberts tells host Harry Connick Jr. that she had reached the point where the fight was too much for her: \\n“There was a time when I sent everybody away, and I was in my room, and I just felt like I'm slipping away. I just couldn't.” \\nOne of the things that had made Roberts feel like giving up was the fact that her mother was no longer there by her side. However, she was soon to find that her mom was closer than she realized. She tells Harry: \\n“I kept hearing this voice, 'Robin! Robin! Robin!' And suddenly, I open my eyes, and it's ... my nurse Jenny. She's looking at me. That was my mother's voice. I am convinced, when I was hearing that, even though it was Jenny, it was my mother's voice I was hearing.” \\nRoberts believes that at her point of “ greatest isolation ,” her mother used Jenny to call her back, to remind her to keep fighting. \\nJenny, Roberts says, was “invaluable” during this time. Acknowledging the bond between Roberts and her nurse, Harry surprised Roberts by reuniting her with nurse Jenny and another nurse who had cared for her. An emotional Roberts was able to thank them for not only everything they had done for her, but for what they have done for countless others: \\n“Thank you for being our lifeline. Thank you for being there— not only for us, but for our caregivers ... for our loved ones.” \"],\n",

There are also other African countries that have been the object of massive Chinese investment in recent years. They also produce commodities in competition with Australia that are in demand by Chinese industry. The strong and expanding Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) reinforces the infrastructure links of the One Belt One Road development. Its six current members include the nations in the above table excluding Afghanistan, Iran and Mongolia (all observer members) and Burma. Pakistan and India are both observer members expected to join in 2017, as will Iran. There are a further six dialogue partners of whom the most strategically and economically important member is Turkey. BRICS and the SCO have a growing relationship with the Eurasian Economic Union, which comprises five member states of which three, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, are also linked via the SCO and the One Belt One Road development. Russia’s membership is common to all of the major economic blocs. Western economic sanctions against Russia and belligerent military activity by NATO on Russia’s borders have been a major driver of closer Sino-Russian relations. China also has been the object of western military pressure, quite apart from the South China Sea issues referred to above. There are currently 400 US military bases encircling China. There is no military justification for this. It is clearly part of an attempt by the US and its allies to “contain” China, a policy that will either fail, as recent developments suggest, or end in war. Either way, the risks to the security of Asian nations are jeopardized. That subplot is again a major reason why so many nations are signing up for the peaceful alternative offered by the One Belt One Road initiatives. It is also a factor in 57 nations, including Australia in a rare show of defiance to the Americans, in joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Again, that bank is a Chinese initiative and a key part of the economic reordering of the world’s financial structures dominated for most of the post world War 2 period by the IMF and World Bank. The Chinese Yuan recently becoming part of the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights is a further weakening of western financial dominance. Even more importantly, China is now conducting its trade with more than 60 countries in each country’s respective currencies, thereby bypassing the US dollar as the sole medium of international trade. The demise of the dollar’s role in world trade will spell the end of US hegemony that has prevailed for the past 70 years. The US will not relinquish that role lightly as Libya and Iraq among others have found to their considerable cost. More turmoil and disruption can be safely predicted irrespective of the outcome of the US Presidential election. The TPP and its European equivalent (the TTIP) are part of the rearguard actions being mounted to prevent the dollar’s collapse from its preeminent position. The relentless proxy wars, regime changes and general destabilization through ‘colour revolutions’ are manifestations of the same desire to maintain what the US Department of Defence called “full spectrum dominance” in its 2002 paper, Vision 2020. That such an arguably insane objective will fail is inevitable. Not the least of the reasons is that countries, especially in Eurasia, have a viable alternative of peaceful development in what President Xi refers to as a “win win” situation for all parties. The issue for Australia is a stark one. Its geography, its trading relationships, its wealth and its economic future all lie squarely with Asia. The conundrum lies in the central message of the 2016 Defence White Paper: the US is and will remain the essential guarantor of Australia’s security, and the military alliance is an unshakeable component of that. It is the paying of insurance premiums on that perception of the alliance that explains Australia’s continued willingness to involve itself in America’s illegal wars. Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria are only some of the more blatant examples. Now however, for the first time in its trading history, Australia’s major trading partner is not also its ally. That its current political policies persist in portraying that major trading partner as a threat, either actual or potential, is evidence of its policy schizophrenia. The perils of such a policy lie in the figures quoted above as to the resources available to China from neighbours and trading bloc partners that can be used to substitute Australian products upon which the past 40 years of Australian prosperity has been based. From a Chinese perspective, if one has a choice between sourcing raw materials from neighbours linked by high-speed rail, or from a belligerent and unreliable alternative that Australia is in danger of becoming, the choice in the vernacular is a no-brainer. China may opt to switch its raw material trade anyway. But a prudent government conscious of Australia’s long term national interest should surely be exploring policy alternatives outside the straitjacket imposed by the US alliance.

       " ['Netanyahu Scuttles Trump’s Russian Rapprochement | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Middle East The game begins. Turkey and Saudi Arabia are unwilling to follow the Trump announced policy on Syria, and are now planning on redoubling their efforts to support ISIS. In order to avoid an obvious confrontation with the US, which has been backing all forces fighting the Assad government including ISIS and other organizations officially deemed “terrorist,” both Turkey and Saudi Arabia have gone to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help. Netanyahu, through back channels, has told all regional powers, including Iran, that any deal making with the US should go through him. Iran has already been given a price to derail Trump’s promised scrapping of the nuclear settlement. Netanyahu has promised them that there will be no new sanctions so long as Iran outsources key areas of their military modernization through Israel. Israel has traditionally been a conduit for restricted US military technology transfers to “listed” nations. Where it is assumed Trump made a huge error was when he stated he would consider backing Assad and Russia against Israeli backed terrorists. It is unlikely that Assad, who has long experience with Netanyahu breaking his word, cut the same deal with Netanyahu that Iran has. With a permanent Russian military presence in Syria and Assad rebuilding his nation after the defeat of ISIS, efforts will certainly return to removing Israel from the illegal occupation of the Golan Heights. You see, the deal cut to allow Israel to take the rest of the West Bank, unrestricted bulldozing of Palestinian homes and unrestricted ethnic cleansing across the rest of defacto Israel (including Judea and Samaria, designated by the UN as Palestinian homeland and making up 40% of pre-1967 Israel) is supported by everyone. The Saudi’s and Qatar are cutting down aid to the Palestinians, Jordan has long viewed them as the primary threat to their security, far more than Israel. (Jordan is an Israeli puppet) Where there has been significant change is how Assad now looks on the Palestinians who quickly joined ISIS, extending their payoffs to fund mercenary operations using Hamas against the Assad government. All of this is made possible by Israel’s free transit of Hamas fighters into Syria and into Jordan to CIA training centers. Netanyahu will now be able to use his newfound relationship with Iran, due to its clandestine nature, to manipulate financial markets at will, ramping up tensions for domestic consumption, and playing Donald Trump like a cheap fiddle. The real question is how Russia will deal with this over the long term. Despite the big talk from Trump, for America to ramp up ground forces inside Syria, while assisting Turkey in moves against the Damascus government, will not pass the “sniff test” in Moscow. Turkey is actively threatening the territorial integrity of both Iraq and Syria and Turkish moves into both nations is directly aimed at securing oil and gas reserves. With Russia and Iran blocking Turkey from seizing the massive gas fields near Aleppo, these are virgin finds, far larger than the offshore reserves Israel is currently accessing, Turkey will drive against the Euphrates oil reserves west of Raqqa and even as far south as Deir Ezzor, another oil rich region of Syria. In Iraq, Turkey is working closely with the Erbil government to seize the Kirkuk oil fields, some of the largest in the world. Peshmerga forces have been ethnically cleansing this area, which is nowhere near Mosul, as key to their efforts in support of the war on ISIS and the taking of Mosul, or so they claim. Despite initial announcements of Erbil backed Kurds, really surrogates of Turkey, advancing on Mosul, these forces have, in fact, turned East and are now driving into Iraqi Sunni areas, ethnically cleansing the Arab populations. What is revealed by this is the long hidden relationship between the Kurds in Erbil and ISIS and how both have been controlled by Erdogan. When Russia showed the world satellite photos of 12,000 oil trucks entering Turkey from Iraq, what was not told is that those trucks, for the last 200 miles of their journey were guarded by Peshmerga forces. Most ISIS oil stolen from Iraq was taken from Kurdish controlled regions, not by ISIS at all, marketed to the world out of the Kurdish capitol of Erbil and trucked to pipeline depots in Turkey through Kurdish, ISIS and even Turkish controlled regions of Iraq. ISIS in fact got very little of the oil revenue but in fact only facilitated transit of stolen oil by the Erbil Kurds and their Turkish partners including, according to reports, the son of Erdogan. The real question here is what will Russia allow? Will it allow Turkey and Saudi Arabia to dismember Syria? Will it remain silent on Turkish efforts to support ISIS while running military operations against them at the same time, or so the world is being told though no one has actually seen any of it. Sources in Damascus have long claimed that the ISIS occupation of areas of Northern Syria currently allegedly under Turkish assault were always controlled by Turkey. Will Putin allow Netanyahu to play his game, which includes betrayal of Russia? How far will Netanyahu get before Russia asserts herself militarily? What Netanyahu is also saying is that he has influence, even control, over the Kiev government. We don’t know if Netanyahu has promised to have Trump recognize Russia’s control of Crimea. This would give considerable leverage over Russia, perhaps enough to endanger Russian support of Syria, which Netanyahu must see as a threat. It will be necessary to watch events in the region. If Trump fails to confront both Turkey and Saudi Arabia over their support of ISIS against the Damascus government, this will represent a massive foreign policy defeat early in his administration. Note that Trump was elected under a cloud, with a significant electoral vote against him and a “win” based on statistical anomalies that are unprecedented, suggesting something that may well bring down his government at some time in the future.

       "  \"Share on Facebook \\nOn Tuesday, researchers announced that there’s enough evidence of hacking or foul play to ask for an audit of three state’s voting tabulations: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Donald Trump won those three states by a narrow margin and without them, he would have lost. \\nThere’s a movement to ask the Justice Department to demand the audits, but they might not have to. Help is coming from a surprising source, the Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. She’s calling for a recount in those three states and we can help her get one. \\n“After a divisive and painful presidential race,” the Green Party candidate said in a statement, “reported hacks into voter and party databases and individual email accounts are causing many Americans to wonder if our election results are reliable.” It's official: Jill Stein announces plans to file for a recount in PA, MI & WI. From her release: pic.twitter.com/Yh0gcVBPOR \\n— Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) November 23, 2016 \\nStein may have a case: \\nLast Thursday, the activists held a conference call with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign general counsel Marc Elias to make their case, according to a source briefed on the call. The academics presented findings showing that in Wisconsin, Clinton received 7 percent fewer votes in counties that relied on electronic-voting machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots. Based on this statistical analysis, Clinton may have been denied as many as 30,000 votes; she lost Wisconsin by 27,000. While it’s important to note the group has not found proof of hacking or manipulation, they are arguing to the campaign that the suspicious pattern merits an independent review — especially in light of the fact that the Obama White House has accused the Russian government of hacking the Democratic National Committee. \\nSource: NY Magazine \\nThe math would still be tight. Michigan’s count still isn’t complete, but it’s likely that their 16 electoral votes would add to Trump’s 290. If those three states were suddenly to suddenly turn blue (Trump won the three states with a combined vote difference of just over 100,000), Trump would have 260 electoral votes and Clinton would have a total of 278 electoral votes. 270 are needed to win. \\nStein wouldn’t end up winning the election, no matter what. It’s hard to imagine what her motive would be, other than transparency and regardless of how you feel about her, that’s laudable. \\nWhat she’s lacking so far is money. She needs to raise $2 million by Friday at 4:00 PM Central Time. So far, she’s raised less than 10 percent of that. \\nDoing something like this may have its downsides, although not too far down. The confidence in the Electoral College is already eroding. There’s no reason at all that three midwestern states should prevent the clear popular winner from becoming President. The biggest risk is that disgruntled Trump supporters could lash out, but they are lashing out as winners, so let’s not let that stop us from taking the time to ensure that our democracy stays intact. \"],\n",

After reading an update on the current state of the Clinton investigation he turns the floor over to Judge Jeanine Pirro who says, “It’s time for a grand jury.” \\nShe says, “It’s time for Loretta Lynch to allow Comey and the FBI to get this evidence before a grand jury. There is a mutiny in the FBI, that’s why all of this stuff is coming out. There are four offices that continue to investigate although Justice has tried to shut this down, saying there’s not enough evidence, this recording from this other person who apparently is an informant is hearsay.” \\nJudge Jeanine adds, “This woman should have been indicted a year ago. A simpleton could figure out that she would make a deal with a particular country, the money goes into the foundation, Bill makes a speech and then they get the benefit. This is classic RICO corruption; go to jail.” \\nHannity asks Monica Crowley, “What is Loretta Lynch hiding here, what is she resisting when it’s clearly an avalanche of evidence?” Crowley says she sees it as the revenge of the FBI rank and file “and the timing is not a coincidence.” She notes that in this country, “If you do not have an independent, impartial and fair Department of Justice and FBI which are only interested in enforcing the rule of law and finding the truth then you have nothing. Obviously that is not what we have with much of the DOJ and with senior FBI leadership. \\nShe describes the email investigation as the shiny object, while it is very important, the real mother lode of corruption is the Clinton Foundation. Crowley insists that the bigger point that the American people need to bear in mind before going to vote on Tuesday is that Clinton leveraged her public office in order to enrich herself, her husband and their foundation. \\nAs the conversation shifts to the fact that Clinton is a target for extortion and blackmail due to her emails being hacked by five different foreign governments, Judge Jeanine declares, “She has sold America’s national security for money. These people are grifters, they’ve been grifters since they came on the scene. And she knew that when she set up that server that it wasn’t secure. She did it for money, she did it to enrich themselves, she didn’t care about our security and Huma Abedin, I don’t know who she and Weiner are connecting with, but these are people who do not have our interests at heart.” \\nCrowley says Clinton should have her security clearance revoked tonight. She believes this will be the straw that finally breaks the camel’s back in the Clinton parasitic relationship with the United States. Crowley knew Richard Nixon well.

       "  '© Photo: AJ Schroetlin Indigenous Americans protest the Columbus Day celebration in Denver, Colorado, on October 9, 2007. \\nWhat myths have most of us been taught about Native Americans? In a new book, All the Real Indians Died Off And 20 Other Myths About Native Americans , Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and Dina Gilio-Whitaker show how generations of people in the United States have been misinformed about Indigenous Americans as part of a colonial agenda of erasure. \\nThe following is the Truthout interview with Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and Dina Gilio-Whitaker. \\nMark Karlin: I was profoundly enlightened when I interviewed you about your last book The Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States . Your new book, written with Dina Gilio-Whitaker debunks 21 myths about Native Americans. Before we get to the book, I want to start and ask you a truly global question, how is the Indigenous rights movement becoming increasingly transnational? \\nRoxanne Dunbar-Ortiz: The international Indigenous movement is becoming increasingly visible, but it has been developing since the early 1920s, when the Haudenosaunee (six Nations of the Iroquois federation) sent a representative, Cayuga leader Deskaheh, to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1923 to address the League of Nations. From the 1930s onwards, Muskogee Creek, Cherokee and Hopi representatives built ties with Indigenous Peoples in Central Mexico, where their peoples had originated. \\nIn 1940, The Interamerican Indian Convention was signed by the governments of the hemisphere, and the Interamerican Indian Institute was founded, which still exists today. In the 1950s, the newly established National Congress of American Indians in the United States and other Native activists actively sought ties with Indigenous Peoples in other parts of the world. But it was in 1974, with the founding of the International Indian Treaty Council by the militant American Indian Movement, and of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples, that formal relations with the United Nations began. \\nThe United Nations Sub-Commission on Racism and Racial Discrimination had taken up a study of Indigenous Peoples globally in 1972 and in 1977, the first international Indigenous Peoples conference was held at the United Nations – the delegates of Indigenous representatives organized by the International Indian Treaty Council. After four years of arduous Indigenous lobbying, a UN Working Group on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was established and met for the first time in 1982, and thereafter annually for 25 years, resulting in massive documentation and testimonies, as well as official reports, and in the 2007 UN General Assembly resolution, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . \\nEarly in the new millennium, a UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues were established, the latter meeting for two weeks annually at UN headquarters in New York, bringing together thousands of Indigenous Peoples’ representatives. In addition to the institutional transnational relationships are the daily exchange of communications among Indigenous Peoples on local, regional and continental issues and emergencies, particularly effective during the past 20 years of increasing Internet capacity. \\nWhat are the roles of erasure and disappearance in creating settler colonialist myth about Native Americans that then justify suppression and theft of land? \\nDina Gilio-Whitaker: Disappearance of the Indigenous population was necessary for the settler project to inherit the land that they believed was rightfully theirs, by divine providence. Very early on, for example, when the Mayflower immigrants of the Plymouth colony were starving and trying to figure out how to feed themselves, we know from primary documents that some of them found villages that had been emptied out due to a disease epidemic a year or two earlier, or in some cases, were still inhabited. They raided food stores and even graves, and saw it as an expression of God’s favor on them, having gotten rid of the Indians so that they could now inhabit the land. \\nBy the 1840s this belief crystalized into the concept of manifest destiny. Then we begin to see the emergence of anthropology and what we now call scientific racism – a science-based ideology that all non-white people are inferior to white Europeans . This Social Darwinism finds its way into Supreme Court decisions about Native lands and nations, which then become the basis for laws and policies that systematically justify extermination, forced assimilation and endless other depredations – that all have at their root the goal of transferring Native lands into white ownership. This is why we say that settler colonialism is a structure that eliminates Natives so that settlers can replace them. And it is this structure that still frames the body of federal Indian law that governs what happens to Native nations and individuals today, all guided by the impulse to eliminate. \\nYou have a chapter on the myth that the US did not engage in a policy of genocide toward Native Americans. Given that’s a loaded term that denialists love to split hairs about, wouldn’t it just be easier to say the European conquerors maintained a policy of trying to make Native Americans vanish? \\nDunbar-Ortiz: The importance of the term “genocide” for many Indigenous Peoples is that it is more than a term or an accusation; it is a word created in the wake of the Shoah in Europe to describe what happens when a people are targeted by a government for extermination, as were the Jews of Europe, and which is the term used in the most important international law related to concerned Indigenous Peoples, as the only international human rights law that pertains specifically to collectivities of people rather than individuals. \\nWe have researched and studied only US policies and actions related to Indigenous peoples in North America, but think that the analysis of the US applies to several of the republics of the Americas, as well as Australia and New Zealand, that imposed settler-colonialism on the Indigenous Peoples, seeking to displace and disappear Indigenous communities and nations to replace them with European settlers. \\nAs the late Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe wrote, “The question of genocide is never far from discussions of settler colonialism.” The history of the United States is a history of settler colonialism. The objective of US authorities was to terminate their existence as peoples – not as random individuals. This is the very definition of modern genocide. The term “genocide” is often incorrectly assumed to mean extreme examples of mass murder associated with war, with the death of millions of individuals, as, for instance in Cambodia. Although clearly the Holocaust was the most extreme of all genocides, the bar set by the Nazis is not the bar required to be considered genocide. Most importantly, genocide does not have to be complete to be considered genocide. Cases of genocide carried out as policy may be found in historical documents as well as in the oral histories of Indigenous communities. An example from 1873 is typical, with General William T. Sherman writing, \\n“We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children … during an assault, the soldiers cannot pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.” \\nWe talked about this in our last interview. Many historical accounts tried to make it appear that presidents and Congress viewed themselves as white saviors to Native Americans. Was that any different than the attitude of European colonialism that decimated vast populations in Africa, the Middle East and the Far East, for example? \\nDunbar-Ortiz: I think there’s a great deal of similarity in this respect among various European and Euroamerican colonialisms, with attempts to justify the capitalist plunder that drove and drives the past 500 years of European and United States imperialism. One of the myths we include in the present book is on the presumed benevolence of US presidents towards Native Americans (Myth 9). \\nWhat is different is the goal of elimination of the Native in the four sites of Anglo settler-colonialism in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Whether it was an expression of the “laws of nature,” that is, the survival of the fittest as explicitly expressed by Andrew Jackson and the embrace of eugenics by Theodore Roosevelt during their presidencies, or in popular culture by Walt Whitman and other writers, or the disappearance through forced assimilation, such as the Indian boarding schools’ goal to “kill the Indian and save the man,” the stamping out and total disappearance of the Native was predominant. In the present, the way benevolence is expressed is in conceptualizing the Native as a historical relic; US people have to be constantly reminded that there are still existent Indigenous peoples and communities in North America, but whether left or right, recent immigrant or descendants of settlers, even descendants of enslaved Africans, the Native presence is not a consideration in the day to day life of individuals and municipal, state and national governments. \\nSince we are coming close to this holiday, can you expand on dispelling the myth that Thanksgiving proves the Indians welcomed the pilgrims? \\nGilio-Whitaker: The story, as it is commonly conveyed, is a feel-good tale of a deep friendship between Pilgrims and Indians, signified by a formal, ostensibly prearranged engagement where they all sit down together to give thanks for a bountiful harvest. \\nThere is not enough evidence to surmise anything of the sort; what there is suggests that it was a random, rather accidental occurrence in which the Wampanoag were investigating the sound of gunfire coming from the English settlement, and then were invited to stay for dinner. The actual relationship between the Wampanoag and the pilgrims can best be described as a political alliance based on desperation and the mutual need for survival. Both were extremely vulnerable. \\nThe pilgrims needed the Indians to teach them how to live on the land, and extreme population decline due to disease had weakened the Wampanoag militarily. A treaty had been negotiated in an atmosphere of mistrust and tension. Within two years, it had completely broken down but then, after about 40 years of relative peace, by 1675 full-scale war had broken out between them, becoming what we know now as King Philip’s War, what’s been called the bloodiest war ever fought on American soil. \\nThis is too recent for your book, but I think your opinion on the activism surrounding the Dakota Access pipeline and the expanding support for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe should be explored. Do you think it is a threshold point for a new stage of defiant, stalwart activism on behalf of reclaiming sovereignty over Indigenous lands and water? \\nGilio-Whitaker: It remains to be seen, but at the moment it does seem that way. What we have to compare it to in this country is the Alcatraz occupation from 1969-1971, the Trail of Broken Treaties in 1972 and Wounded Knee in 1973. \\nThose movements, like this one, were youth-led (although women are much more out front these days). Those were also the days that gave birth to the ethnic studies disciplines, and growing numbers of Indians becoming lawyers. So what we have now is new generations of Natives with sophisticated educations, and savvy political and organizing skills. They understand their history, they understand they’re living with intergenerational trauma, but they still have enough of their cultures and traditions that have the power to heal them. And that makes them strong and relentless, like their ancestors before them. What’s different now is that there are greater levels of support coming from non-Natives, because it’s recognized now that Native struggles to protect land and water are everyone’s struggles. And let’s remember that this standoff at Standing Rock comes on the heels of years of climate justice activism, which is widely acknowledged to be led by Indigenous peoples. Standing Rock is only the most recent manifestation of that. \\nAbout the author \\nMark Karlin is the editor of BuzzFlash at Truthout.

SOTT Comment: Read more from Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz: The colonization of America was genocidal by plan: Yes, Native Americans were the victims of genocide \\nUS history, as well as inherited Indigenous trauma, cannot be understood without dealing with the genocide that the United States committed against Indigenous peoples. From the colonial period through the founding of the United States and continuing in the twentieth century, this has entailed torture, terror, sexual abuse, massacres, systematic military occupations, removals of Indigenous peoples from their ancestral territories, forced removal of Native American children to military-like boarding schools, allotment, and a policy of termination. \\nWithin the logic of settler-colonialism, genocide was the inherent overall policy of the United States from its founding, but there are also specific documented policies of genocide on the part of US administrations that can be identified in at least four distinct periods: the Jacksonian era of forced removal; the California gold rush in Northern California; during the Civil War and in the post Civil War era of the so-called Indian Wars in the Southwest and the Great Plains; and the 1950s termination period; additionally, there is the overlapping period of compulsory boarding schools, 1870s to 1960s. The Carlisle boarding school, founded by US Army officer Richard Henry Pratt in 1879, became a model for others established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Pratt said in a speech in 1892, \\n“A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one. In a sense, I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him and save the man.” Share: '],\n",
       " ['EU Politicians are Convinced that Tanks are the Best Remedy for Social Disparity | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Europe Following in the wake of the White House policy, European poli tical elites have been stepping up their groundless propagandistic rhetoric about the growing military threat of Russia, Iran, China, which is aimed at achieving further militarization of Europe at the expense of t he social benefits of its citizens. In his recent speech at an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, NATO ‘s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced that he expects a 3% real increase in defence spending in Europe and Canada, however, he added, other than the US , only four NATO members are currently spending 2% of GDP on defence . Against the background of a string of upcoming election campaigns in the EU, it’s really not that hard to predict how Europeans are going to take the announcement that their governments are planning to increase their military budgets. The most likely scenario is that a number of EU states will vote for their own version of Trumpxit, which means that an outsider candidate will have more chances that those from the ruling elites. As the living conditions of an ever increasing number of Europeans continue to deteriorate, it’s highly unlikely that EU citizens are going to tolerate new military expenditures . The data provided by the Eurostat shows that i n 2015, around 25 million children, or 26.9% of the population aged 0 to 17, in the European Union were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. A total of six member states saw a third of all children being at risk of poverty or social exclusion, these are Romania (46.8%), Bulgaria (43.7%), Greece (37.8%), Hungary (36.1%), Spain (34.4%) and Italy (33.5%). According to the Guardian, having a child while living in a rental accommodation has become unaffordable for young families in two - thirds of the UK. The most inaccessible place for those wanting to start a family was London, with a two-bedroom rental there costing 60% of the average income for someone in their 20 s and 44% for someone in their 30 s . This was followed by the south-east, south-west and the east. At the same time, the number of families with children living in emergency accommodations in England rose by 45% in the last 12 months, reaching the highest level in 12 years . In turn, the Fabian Society says the Tory’s social cuts will increase the number of kids living in poverty by 75% over the next 15 years in the UK, the Daily Mirror notes. Moreover, Berlin has already announced that social disparity will be steadily growing throughout the upcoming decade in Germany. The Finish Yle notes that the number of children living in poor families has tripled over the last two decades. What is striking is that even those families where both parents are employed full time are unable to earn an adequate revenue. Ever since 2008, the deepening social crisis in the EU has been making local citizens feeling increasingly frustrated with their elected officials. At the same time, local political elites are reluctant to address the most pressing problems of their population, instead they prefer to increase military spendings and cut social benefits provided to the poor. The chain of events, namely the Brexit and the Trumpxit shows the growing frustration of the hard-working people that are still unable to provide decent childhood for their children. And it doesn’t take a genius to know that the ruling elites are going to face a bitter electoral defeat in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Austria. There’s really no way they can win.

       " ['The Northern Sea Route: New Prospects for the Pacific Rim | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Asian-Pacific region Twenty years ago, eight Arctic states established the Arctic Council (AC) to jointly develop the Arctic Region and preserve the environment and culture of the indigenous peoples. Initially, Denmark, Iceland, Canada, Norway, Russia, the United States, Finland and Sweden held memberships in the Council. Later, other states with interests in the Arctic Region joined the AC. India, China, Singapore, South Korea and Japan were granted the observer status by AC several years ago. Considering financial capacity and vast experience in the marine logistics of these countries, they can render valuable assistance to the AC member states. They all had to make strenuous effort to join the AC. Today they are doing their best to gain access to the Arctic resources and maritime routes. The real treasure of the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean is, of course, the Russian Northern Sea Route (NSR), running through the Arctic Ocean along the Russian Federation’s northern coast. Lately, Russia has been devoting much attention to the development of this unique transport corridor. In his December 2015 address to the Federal Assembly, Russian President Vladimir Putin talked about the significance of the NSR. The NSR has been repeatedly referred to as the corner stone of economic growth and transport safety for the northern territories and Russia as a whole. This is the shortest sea route from the European part of Russia to the Far East. In a broader sense, the NSR is a huge section of the shortest sea route connecting Europe and Asia and the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Access to the NSR would mean for Asian states a major reduction of time and cost required to ship goods to Europe. Currently, almost all cargo is delivered to Europe via the Suez Canal, along the southern coast of Eurasia. Not only is this way much longer, but also riskier since there is a threat of pirate and terrorist attacks. In recent years, the risks associated with shipping goods along this route doubled because of tense situation in the Pacific Rim. Territorial disputes between China and other countries of the region, attempts of the US to retain its influence there might trigger a situation when someone decides to block the southern route for navigation. It would not be hard to do either since this route has several vulnerable areas that could be easily seized and controlled by relatively small groups of people. They are narrow passages, including the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca. If, God forbid, something like that happens, the NSR can become a life saver for the countries of the Asia Pacific region trading with Europe. It is worth mentioning that the NSR runs through Russian territorial waters, which means that the countries looking to use it have to build rapport with Russia. This circumstance might play an important role in the development of Russian international relations. What is more, the states wishing to use the NSR would have to participate in its development, including as investors. It is a complicated and costly task to upkeep the NSR. Russia has to employ its icebreaker fleet, and more so in wintertime, which is very expensive, to support navigation. As of today, Russia uses the NSR mostly to ship cargo and deliver the goods manufactured by local industry from the Extreme North ports. One of the key users of the NSR is the Russian company Norilsk Nickel. It owns more than half of all goods shipped via the NSR. Since Norilsk Nickel owns icebreakers, the company is able to deliver its products year round. Gazprom and Rosneft are two other companies forwarding goods via the NSR. The Russian Northern Territories development program implies engagement of foreign companies willing to participate in the maintenance of the NSR’s navigability. Japan is one of the countries showing a genuine interest in cooperation. At the beginning of 2016, Japan’s Arctic ambassador Kazuko Shiraishi made a curious statement. She said that Japan was willing to ship up to 40% of all cargo it currently delivers to Europe via the NSR. Japan, in turn, can render assistance in the monitoring of ice conditions. China is another major potential user of the NSR. At first glance, it might seem rather odd since China is developing its Maritime Silk Road, which will connect Asia to Europe via the southern route mentioned above. Some experts predicted that the Maritime Silk Road and the Northern Sea Route would become rivals. However, it looks like China sees certain advantages in having a backup route understanding the volatility of situation in the Asia Pacific region. For whatever reasons, the Chinese government has demonstrated its interest in the NSR on a number of occasions. In 2013, the first Chinese ship Yong Sheng sailed along the NSR. It began its journey in the port of Dalian (China) and arrived in Rotterdam (Netherlands). However, much remains to be done for the NSR to become an adequate alternative for a longer southern sea route, including the development of a sophisticated infrastructure featuring marine terminals in different sections of the route for yearlong loading and unloading (currently, only one NSR port, Dudinka, can accommodate ships all year long). The Russian side is casting a hopeful eye on Chinese investors as prospective partners for this project. Apparently, the “Celestial Empire” is also committed to secure its foothold in the NSR. Currently, China is energetically participating in the development of the Arkhangelsk Region. For several centuries, Arkhangelsk has been the Russia’s strategic foothold in the Arctic Region. This is one of the key sections of the NSR with high concentration of industrial facilities and important seaports. Today as before, the Arkhangelsk Region is given high priority in the new “Socio-economic Development of Russian Arctic Region” project. In October 2016, the Russian company Arctic Transportation and Industrial Hub “Archangelsk” signed a contract with the Chinese Poly International Holding Co. According to the document, the Chinese company will fund the construction of a deep-water port near the Madyug Island in the White Sea. This will be a weighty contribution to the development of the NSR. It is anticipated that by 2030 the new port’s turnover could exceed 30 million tons of goods. China’s profound interest in the Arkhangelsk Region was demonstrated once again when a major Chinese company Huadian decided to invest funds in the region’s power sector. Last summer, the joint Russian-Chinese enterprise “Huadian-Arkhangelsk CHPP” bought out the only source of central heating in the region, the Arkhangelsk CHPP, by paying off its 2.7 billion rubles debt. It is clear that China is really interested in gaining access to the Arctic territories of the Russian Federation. The Northern Sea Route is a unique transport corridor with a potential of placing Russia among the most important transit countries in the world. Besides, the NSR can attract many major foreign investors. And Russia’s foremost task is to give them a warm welcome.

Her tiny hand included an extra thumb. \\nLove What Matters posted a photo of the baby girl on its Facebook page: Loading Facebook Post... \\nAs the newborn's parents explain, that third thumb earned their daughter some extra medical tests. And those extra tests led to an important discovery. They write : \\n“Quincy has an extra thumb, which now we realize was a blessing in disguise.

However, with proper medical care, children with heart defects can go on to live healthy and active lives. \\nIronically, from the moment her mother first saw the extra thumb, she called it her daughter's “heart thumb.” Though she didn't realize it at the time, that nickname would be a perfect way to describe her “lucky” extra digit: \\n“When Liv saw her thumb for the first time, she told us it was her heart thumb.

       " ['More Bang for the Buck | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Russia in the World More bang for the buck is the most apt description when we compare spending of the United States Government with that of the Government of the Russian Federation on its defense sector and military technology development. A closer look at the two budgets reveals the huge fault line that cuts across the entire US economy today. It also mirrors the true collapse of the American hegemon as a world power. It need not have been. In the official Fiscal Year 2017 the US Department of Defense officially requested $523.9 billion in what they call “discretionary funding,” as in, “we use it as we please, no independent audit allowed.” Another $58.8 billion was requested for so-called Overseas Contingency Operations, typical Pentagon-speak for wars everywhere from Afghanistan to Syria to military operations around the South China sea. That made an official total of $583 billion requested and granted by a docile Congress . On October 13, the Russian wire-service Tass.ru reported that the Russian government is set to spend 948.59 billion rubles on national defense in 2017, according to the draft federal budget posted. It sounds like a lot, almost one trillion rubles. If we convert at the current dollar exchange rate, this translates into a mere $15 billion. Of that 793.79 billion rubles or $12.7 billion is planned to be spent on the Russian Armed Forces. In 2015 the Russian Federation spent $26 billion on the state military-industrial complex development program will reach 1.67 trillion rubles . That total for military industry investment and maintaining Russia’s armed forces, some $49 billion, equals 8.4 % of the dollar amount the United States Defense Department plays with annually . To that must be added the separate amount of $400 billion for modernization of Russian armed forces military capabilities by 2020. That’s roughly another $80 billion a year. Now the relevant question at a time when Washington-led NATO forces are aggressively moving to the borders of the Russian Federation, when US Pentagon Special Forces and mercenaries like Blackwater aka Academi are mucking around Ukraine causing mischief, destruction and murder, is which country is getting better defense or military capacities for every dollar spent. Astonishing performance The answer came following the September 30, 2015 Russian announcement that it had agreed to respond with military support to the call of the legitimate government of Syria. What Russian military efforts have accomplished with meager resources, has astonished most western military experts. Far from being the dilapidated, technologically obsolescent Soviet-era military that many US planners reckon, Russia’s armed forces have undergone a quiet and impressive modernization ever since it became clear around 2007 that Washington was intent on pushing NATO to Moscow’s front door in Ukraine and Georgia as well as threatening with US missile “defense” in Poland, Czech Republic and now also in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shiogu is a remarkable organizer who is known for reorganizing large Russian government departments. Before becoming Defense Minister he was head of the large Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations, responsible for emergency situations, such as floods, earthquakes and acts of terrorism. The result of Russia’s military modernization, partly demonstrated in the military intervention in Syria, has been a strategic shift in the global military balance of power that Washington’s neo-conservatives, none of whom have served in active duty military theatres, did not reckon with. Russian science and engineering have accomplished astonishing results with minimum investment. Just a select glance at what is being developed is instructive. Hypersonic nuclear missile On October 25 the Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau published the first image of the newest heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, the RS-28 Sarmat known under NATO’s reporting name SS-X-30. It will replace its predecessor, the R36M2 Voyevoda or NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan. It is now in test phase and will enter service at the end of 2018. The SS-X-30 will replace the world’s most powerful strategic missile, the SS-18 Satan. One reason Washington pursued the Start-1 strategic arms reduction treaty with Moscow was because the Pentagon estimated that the SS-18 with its multiple warhead consisting of ten independently targetable re-entry vehicles each having a yield of 750 kilotons was a serious threat. Now, the new successor, SS-X-30 according to Tass military analyst, Viktor Litovkin, is far more threatening. While specific details are top secret, according to Litovkin, the new ICBM will evade any missile defense arrays Washington can install. It has far smaller liftoff mass and a greater range of flight up to 17,000 kilometers, able to reach virtually any target in the Continental USA. It is designed to go on flight paths crossing the South Pole, from where they are least-expected and where no missile shields are being created. Each missile will carry between 10-15 independently targetable nuclear warheads, in a “grape cluster” able to separate from the cluster one by one when a pre-loaded program issues the order to attack the selected target, Litovkin adds . He says that the SS-X-30 re-entry vehicle, called by Russian media Yu-71, and by its developer ‘object 4202′, or Aero-ballistic Hypersonic Warhead, will fly at hypersonic speeds of Mach 17, roughly 4.3 miles (7km) per second, with flight path’s altitude and direction constantly changing all the time making it immune to any missile defenses the Pentagon has deployed in Poland or South Korea, even those relying on space-based elements. “For the SS-X-30 it makes no difference if there is a missile defense or if there is none. It will slip through unnoticed,” says Litovkin . The new missile is capable of wiping out a country the size of France with nuclear explosions 2,000 times more powerful than the bomb used at Hiroshima in 1945 by Washington . Pentagon bucks go to waste The SS-X-30 development is but one of numerous game-changing weapons technologies Russia has been combat testing in Syria. Another is the cutting-edge Russian T-14 Armata tank that has no western competitor. Russian fighter jets have demonstrated their value in Syria and Russian anti-missile Contrast this with the colossal waste of US defense budget spending. Washington is used to fight wars, like the school classroom bully, only against tiny unequipped enemies like Saddam Hussein or Gaddafi in Libya. Granted US defense giants like Boeing or Lockheed Martin are working on hypersonic jets and other classified new weapons. However, the efficiency of every dollar spent on US military hardware is overshadowed by the effective of Russian defense spending. A recent US Defense Department report stated that the budget controls of the pentagon are non-existent. Alone the US Department of the Army cannot provide an audit trail for a cumulative $6.5 trillion of expenses . There are deep cultural and historical reasons why Russia has responded to the actions of Washington and NATO since 2007 as they have. They are deadly serious about defending the Russian Motherland as they term it. Washington politicians, regardless who is President, would do well to take this into their calculations when they egg on European NATO partners to provoke Russia in every way imaginable. Europeans would also do well to reconsider whether being Washington’s front line in NATO is worth the price of possible nuclear pulverization. I think not personally. F.

       "  '\\nMad World News \\nBarack Obama is delusional. While he’s campaigning for Hillary Clinton, the FBI is investigating clear evidence that indicates he is guilty of treason. These idiots, Obama and Hillary, are in denial, running around the country and droning on about “hope and change” when the cat’s out of the bag. New evidence could put Obama in prison right next to Hillary, and Americans couldn’t be happier. \\nNo one is above the law, but Hillary and her crime cartel thought that they were. Now, Obama is facing his worst nightmare as the FBI is also gunning for him. Shocking new revelations came from Fox News’ Catherine Herridge, who reports that Huma Abedin spilled the beans on Obama: \\n“One of the key things we’ve learned in the FBI interviews, known as 302s, came from Clinton aide Huma Abedin . She told the FBI investigators that every time Hillary Clinton’s personal [email] address changed, they would update the White House so that the president could continue receiving Hillary Clinton’s emails on his high security devices, including his Blackberry.” \\nListen to the shocking report below: \\nHerridge went on to explain , “The reason that matters is that that is evidence that goes to knowledge of the White House [Obama] of this personal system [Hillary’s home-based server] and the changing addresses. So, this is something where the president and the White House clearly have a horse in the race and a stake in the outcome [FBI investigation].” \\nThis is exactly what happened to former president Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal , except no one made money and there was never any risk to national security. So, as far as degree of damage done, Hillary and Obama put American lives at risk and allowed our enemies access to our top secrets — and that’s treason. '],\n",

       "  'Breaking News PIERS MORGAN: “Get Off Your High Horse, Hillary. Only ONE Candidate is Up To Her Neck in FBI Probes and Her Name Isn’t Donald” PIERS MORGAN: “Get Off Your High Horse, Hillary. Only ONE Candidate is Up To Her Neck in FBI Probes and Her Name Isn’t Donald” Breaking News By TruthFeedNews November 4, 2016 \\nBy Piers Morgan When I competed in Donald Trump ’s first season of Celebrity Apprentice , he pitched me in the finale against country music star Trace Adkins. NBC promoted our showdown in endless commercials as ‘USA versus UK, good versus evil.’ Trace was portrayed as a strong, kind, polite, hard-working, all-American hero. I was depicted as an arrogant, obnoxious, ruthless British villain. There was just one problem, as I pointed out to Trump in a boardroom exchange that tragically never got aired. ‘One of us,’ I explained, ‘is a violent alcoholic who’s been shot by an ex-wife, stabbed in bar-room knife fights, and has a criminal record for a DUI.’ I competed in Donald Trump’s first season of Celebrity Apprentice – and I was once portrayed as evil, not unlike how Donald has been branded these days Yesterday, Hillary Clinton showed she didn’t get the ‘rise above the monster’ memo, shrieking herself hoarse (pictured today speaking in North Carolina) I paused for effect. ‘The other…. is me…. the bad guy.’ Trump roared with laughter. He got the irony, even if viewers never got the chance to. I was reminded of this today as I watched President Obama tear into Trump, branding him a small-brained, star-f***ing, Ku Klux Klan tolerating ‘loser’ born with a silver spoon in his mouth. It was an astonishingly personal and nasty attack from a man whose own wife Michelle recently declared from atop her lofty moral plinth: ‘When they go low, we go high.’ Yesterday, Hillary Clinton showed she didn’t get the ‘rise above the monster’ memo either, shrieking herself hoarse as she once again laid into Trump supporters she recently described as ‘The Deplorables’. ‘I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and the anger of people who support Donald Trump,’ she raged. This follows a familiar pattern from Team Clinton as election day draws closer: when in doubt, trash Trump and his followers in the meanest, ugliest, most personal way possible. The mantra seems to be: ‘When they go low, we plummet even lower.’ A similar mistake was made in Britain during the EU referendum debate when the Remain campaigners belittled and berated the Brexiters in a snide, sneering, superior manner. They lost. The problem for Mrs Clinton as she gallops across the fields of America like a crusading white knight trying to single-handedly save the nation from imminent Armageddon at the hands of Mr Evil is that she’s the Trace Adkins of this battle. In other words, she ain’t no saint herself. Her supporters don’t accept this of course. To them, Hillary is a vestal political virgin of unimpeachable integrity. ‘Why would I want to criticise her?’ a female Clinton-ite actress indignantly asked me on Twitter yesterday. ‘She’s up against a mad man. Compared to him, she’s bathed in golden light.’ It was the kind of thing I’d expect Tom Cruise to say in defence of his beloved basket case Scientologists. Yet as I write this, Clinton is facing potential FBI criminal investigations on two fronts. One is the re-opened case of her ongoing email scandal, this time centering on the contents of sexting pervert Anthony Weiner’s laptop. The second, according to the Washington Post, is an investigation into an alleged ‘pay-or-play’ operation Hillary ran out of the State Department that favoured donors to the Clinton Foundation charity. At the root of it lies a central charge that the Clintons have cynically and greedily exploited political power and status to enrich themselves, under the convenient protective umbrella of their Foundation. Big sponsors have been repeatedly ‘invited’ to donate big sums to the Foundation, then also donate big sums to the personal fortunes of Bill or Hillary in the form of cash, holidays, private jets and other benefits. On the face of it, this seems like a prima facie case of potential corruption. Yet the Post further reports the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation has been held up by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, to the fury of many in the FBI. This is the same Loretta Lynch who Bill Clinton hijacked for a 30-minute conversation on a private airstrip days before the original FBI email investigation verdict exonerating his wife was made public. We can all draw our own conclusions, none of them I suspect very pretty. I know from first-hand experience there’s no such thing as a free lunch with the Clintons. There is no such thing as a free lunch with the Clintons. I know from my own dealings it’s quid-pro-quo: Bill would scratch my back if I scratched his I’ve interviewed Bill Clinton twice, for CNN. On both occasions, the request was only granted once I had agreed to moderate a panel for the former president at his annual Clinton Global Initiative event in aid of Clinton Foundation. It was a strict quid-pro-quo: Bill would scratch my back if I scratched his. So I scratched away, as do many other TV journalists each year who want an interview with him. There’s a similar pattern to almost everything in Planet Clinton: they trade favours. But when that trade involves millions of dollars raked into personal bank accounts on the back of charity donations, it stinks to high heaven. ‘Trace’ Clinton should get off her high horse, before she gets a nosebleed. \\nH/T – DailyMail \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.

       "  \"\\n21st Century Wire says… \\nYesterday, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew – that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White House’s claim of the US election process being “hacked by the Russian government” was a desperate work of fiction. Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low (if that was even possible) with another, wilder made-up conspiracy story about the Russians. \\nThe following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term “ jumping the shark “: It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX \\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 \\nApparently, Hillary Clinton’s campaign staff fed her a planted online news story (by the Clinton campaign?) which ran on a questionable pro-Democratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged “journalists” named Franklin Foer , complete with a clickbait blog-like headline, “Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?” \\nWhatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated. \\nJohn Roberts from Forbes explains, “The bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a “follow up” piece is in the works.” \\nRoberts rightly points out that the only follow-up story for this lemon should start with the word “RETRACTION.” \\nCYBER FEUD: Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession. \\nDuring his exclusive interview with award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton’s shrill antics, Julian Assange said, “ “I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick.” \\nThe saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party – is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess. \\nStill, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower – with a decade-old misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZ-style tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season. \\nAssange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it. \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE – SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV \"],\n",

       " ['Will Carlos Danger Cut a Deal? - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nThe criminal investigation underway over Anthony Weiner’s alleged child sex infraction has a couple of characteristics that make it especially awkward for Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, the estranged wife of Weiner and close companion of Hillary. \\nEd Timperlake points out to me that in an underage sex investigation, all electronic communications of the investigative target are pursued. This probably led to the grand jury that was announced 11 days ago issuing a subpoena for all of the devices in the possession of Weiner and his family, including Huma. As Lucianne Goldberg quipped, they even seize the Speak & Spell toys in these cases. This grand jury is in New York, possibly less politically supervised than the first Hillary email investigation. \\nEvidently, some of these devices were not turned over in the first investigation and contained “pertinent” emails. We do not know with certainty, but some reports indicate the pertinent emails may have been found on Weiner’s laptop. Recall that the initial investigation did not convene a grand jury and did not, therefore, have subpoena power. It is possible that Huma Abedin misled the FBI over the existence of pertinent emails on her then husband’s computing devices. \\nSo what could have been on the laptop Carlos Danger used for sexting? \\nAdam Yoshida, with a background in information technology consulting for affluent and powerful people emails: \\n…Clinton [was] using e-mails seemingly like most people use IMs or text messaging. Her holding onto Blackberries (and seven switching back to older models when the software was upgraded) [demonstrates this]. It might even explain at least SOME of the motivation for the e-mail server itself. I’ve seen plenty of cases where a powerful person says basically, “I want my e-mails on this thing” and, regardless of whether it’s a good solution, people respond, “ready-aye-ready.” \\nSo, what could they have found on Weiner’s computers that would have caused such alarm? \\nI’d think one of two things: \\n1) Either that Huma signed in her e-mail account at one point and, presumably, it being Exchange or IMAP, dumped the whole account onto the computer and that account has plenty of e-mails between her and Clinton that were deleted. \\nOr – \\n2) There’s mention of Huma having a Yahoo account to which she would forward things for printing purposes. This struck me right away because, of course, printers are often difficult to configure as are e-mail accounts. It struck me as strange, yet very believable, that she mentioned that she’d forward stuff to that Yahoo account to print them. I mean, printing in theory should be platform agnostic, but – if you’re technically unsophisticated – you might have serious problems trying to setup an e-mail account or a printer on a device. Thus I imagine a scenario where she has a portable machine that either she can’t (or can’t be, for some reason) configured to use her home printer and a desktop machine (I imagine an slightly-older iMac here) that’s physically connected to the printer that serves as a shared “family computer” or whatever. She either can’t setup the e-mail account on that computer (perhaps it requires a VPN or something like that) or doesn’t want to, so she forwards everything that she wants to print to the Yahoo account that she does have setup on that computer. The FBI takes this computer as part of the Weiner investigation and, bam, they find thousands of e-mail messages – again, evidence of what was destroyed earlier. '],\n",

       "  'on November 6, 2016 3:40 pm · \\nTrying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn’t hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star ‘s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trump’s lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . \\nThere are literally hundreds of lies in Trump’s speeches. They’re not all 100% unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. \\nIs there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much? Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, she’s actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. \\nThe Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories: Clinton’s policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clinton’s record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons’ corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trump’s endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obama’s record, The campaign, Russia, Trump’s record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clinton’s health and Government corruption. \\nThey also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, “The electoral system is rigged.” Of course, it’s rigged against him: \\n“After plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. ‘Rigged’ became his catchword. \\nHe claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired ‘thugs’ to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis — cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. \\nIn Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they don’t trust mail-in ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55-year-old from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice.” \\nNobody’s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. \\nAnother is, “Muslims are risky.” This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time: \\n“His claims that Syrian refugees — 99 per cent are Muslim — are terrorists plays to the fears of the “other,” even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trump’s claims — about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016.” \\n“The polls favour Trump.” Har de har har – Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and they’re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless: \\n“It seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This ‘poll denialism’ gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. \\nHis false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling — and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. \\nOn Oct. 24, he said ‘I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it.’ In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. \\nOf course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote — and exaggerate — those numbers.” \\nBut these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also: Falsely said on Twitter, “The failing NYTimes reporters don’t even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!” Falsely said, “By ‘open borders,’ [Hillary] means totally unlimited immigration.” Falsely said, “Hillary’s plan includes an open border with the Middle East.” Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, “a Democrat.” Falsely said, “Wow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible.” Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran “$150 billion” as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, “In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people…Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.” Falsely asserted that Clinton has “been fighting ISIS (her) entire adult life.” Falsely said, “All together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term.” Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO “obsolete because it doesn’t cover terror;” falsely suggested NATO created an anti-terror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didn’t release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him “have been largely debunked.” Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, “The one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense.” Falsely said “I did not. I did not” to Clinton’s charge that he thinks Climate change is a “hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.” Falsely said, “I was against going into Iraq. And it’s so well-documented.” Falsely said, “Our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.” \\nAnd so many more, just in the last six weeks! Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, he’ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper’s lying, and continue to sell the myth that he’s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies. \\nTo see the full list and detailed analysis, click here . \\nFeatured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images Share this Article!

       " ['Julian Assange Isn’t Done With Hillary, Reveals Hidden Human Trafficking Network | EndingFed News Network',\n",
       "  '\\nI have been reporting for weeks now about the D.C.-based “pizza pedophilia” ring that is being exposed based on thousands of “Podesta emails” released by Wikileaks in the past month or two. \\nAs of last week, the case became even more explosive. \\n— Thomas Bernpaine (@ThomasBernpaine) November 11, 2016 \\nNow, don’t get nervous because it looks like computer mumbo-jumbo. You only need to remember two things. \\n1 – Every picture file is actually a code/pattern of numbers that our computers “translate” into images on the screen. \\n2 – Some “extra” information has been discovered in at least one picture code/pattern from a Wikileaks email. \\nI reported weeks ago about this “pedo ring” something called “photo steganography,” which is just the fancy term for the two points I explained just now. \\nThe image (.jpg) of the two girls eating pizza was discovered as an attachment in the Podesta emails by Wikileaks. Data can be hidden in a .jpg file. In that image, a zipped directory (PK) was hidden inside. That doesn’t happen by accident. The directory likely contains illegal imagery and/or discussion. It is highly suggestive of illegal activity connected to child pornography, child exploitation, and child abuse. \\nSome have objected that the pizza.jpg file size is simply too small to contain any useful data (like an image, a link, a message, etc.), but the point is this: all the file would have to “smuggle” is a short password to open a secret website or .zip file. The hidden data could literally just be a few bits of information but it could open up thousands of gigabytes of data in the right website or compressed file. That’s how the users would access the dirty pictures, videos, messages, etc. \\nSo, from a technical angle, this method is very possible, and it makes sense of why the Podesta emails include so many strange photo attachments. Are all those attachments little “Trojan ponies” for sharing images, videos, passwords, payment resources, etc.? \\nWATCH (Language/NSFW Warning): \\n“Why do we even have an FBI? Is the FBI just covering for these people?” \\nLet me be honest: \\nI have researched corruption cases like this for many years, whether in current events or from historical records. So, I believe I have a somewhat thick skin when it comes to facing human sinfulness and evil like this. \\nLast Friday night, however, I won’t lie: I totally lost it. \\nAll of a sudden, too many lightbulbs went off at once, too many connections hit me at once, too many implications dawned on me at once–and I just went into a kind of panic attack about how massive this whole cartel is, how well protected it is, and how truly destructive it is in real children’s lives. \\nIf you want to get an idea of what set me off, let me show you three images. \\nBUT I WARN YOU: When you understand the context, these images are EXTREMELY DISTURBING. \\nFirst, here is a photo of Tony Podesta’s favorite work of art in his home: \\nTony Podesta is a big fan of “The Arch of Hysteria” \\nNext, here is an ad from Ping Pong Pizza, a restaurant in D.C. that has numerous, very disturbing connections to pedophilia and D.C. elites like the Podestas. \\nAnother “arch of hysteria”? \\nNext we come to a police photo from the Jeffrey Dahmer case. \\nVIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: \\nI wonder if Tony Podesta would also like this “arch of hysteria”… \\nFinally, here is the logo for Comet Pizza, another D.C. restaurant with deep connections to Ping Pong Pizza and the Podestas. \\nCan you see now why I “lost my [bleep]” last Friday? \\nWorse, in terms of how protected this satanic ring of perverts is, I recently reported that even the DOJ is compromised . \\nA man named Arun Rao has shown a disturbing interest in some sexually “creepy” images and expressions that are connected to the Podestas and this pedo ring. The problem is that Rao is an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the DOJ. \\nSpecifically, Rao is Supervisor of the Southern (“Greenbelt”) Division office for the DOJ’s District of Maryland in Chevy Chase, Maryland. This means that Rao’s district is virtually on top of the area in D.C. where Besta Pizza operates. In addition, Besta Pizza and two other associated properties are directly over abandoned underground tunnels, many of which could easily connect to Chevy Chase. \\nOn top of his social and geographical proximity to Alefantis, Rao’s DOJ division handles cases that seem tailor-made for busting—or covering up—the dark circles that sex traffickers hide in: federal racketeering, conspiracy, national and international fraud and corruption, immigration violations, counterfeiting, and —wait for it—child pornography . \\nIn closing I will leave you with three “infographics.” \\nThey are very complicated and “dense” so I don’t expect everyone to examine them. \\nHowever, even if you don’t look into the details yourself, I want you to be aware of how vast this whole network of evil is, and, therefore, of how many hands and prayers we need on deck to expose it and bring it down. \\n(NOTE: You don’t have to download these images to view them.

       "  \"Share on Twitter \\nNearly every day, Kathleen Hotard walks down her driveway to meet her son as he gets off the bus. Though he's only five years old, Kenneth has been taking the bus home from school for almost two years. \\nSo when Hotard didn't see her son at the bus stop after school, she was afraid. When she learned why he wasn't there, that fear quickly turned to anger. Image Credit: Screenshot/WWL-TV \\nAs WWL-TV News reports, Hotard had gone to the bus stop on Monday and waited for her son to appear. When he didn't, the worried mother immediately thought about the terrible things that could have happened. She tells WWL-TV: \\n“The driver opened the doors and my child was not on the bus. The driver informed me he was not there and that she didn't know where he was but that he had not gotten on the bus that day. You get this pit in your stomach because you don't know where your child is. You don't know if they're okay or if they're crying for you.” \\nLearning why her son hadn't gotten on the bus didn't make things better. Upset that the other children were throwing spitballs that sometimes hit him, Kenneth had told his teacher he had a note from his mother giving him permission to walk home from school. \\nUnfortunately, there was no note, but the school failed to confirm that fact with Hotard. She tells WWL-TV: \\n“I was informed my child had lied and said he had a parental note to walk home. I confirmed I never wrote a note, and they confirmed they never saw a note. He said he had misplaced it.” \\nAfter learning that a substitute teacher had taken Kenneth at his word with no follow-up, Hotard is now demanding action from the school. Though she says that she is angry with her son for lying, she also wonders why the school didn't check with her before allowing her son to walk home alone. \\nAs for Kenneth, a call to the police from a concerned citizen helped find him. He was found about a half mile from school, heading in the wrong direction down a busy road. He admitted that he got “kind of” lost trying to get home. \\nThe school superintendent has apologized and promised to investigate what went wrong. Hotard hopes that this will be followed by safeguards that will prevent the same thing from happening again. She tells WWL-TV: \\n“I don’t want any other parent to ever have to feel what I felt. I don’t want any other child to be on a side of a road by themselves scared.” \"],\n",
       " ['USA – China: Who Is Responsible for North Korean Nuclear Weapons Programme Development? | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: China North Korea’s announcements of the completion of its Nuclear Weapons Development Programme have caused an outburst of discussion on “who is to blame”. More accurately, it concerns who is primarily responsible for the escalation of the situation to its current level. Against the backdrop of growing USA-China opposition, now Beijing has even been accused this, with accusations varying from “did nothing, although it could” to “actively assisted”. Let’s start with statements made by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. On October 13, 2016 the Associated Press, referring to WikiLeaks, reported that in June, 2013, during a lecture to Goldman Sachs officials, Hillary Clinton pointed out that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army is the main sponsor of North Korea. It was at that time when she stated her position – if Beijing is not able to keep North Korea from creating an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying nuclear weapons, the USA may encircle China with a ring of missile defence systems and naval bases. Sankei Shimbun (Japan) quotes the US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter: “China is a primarily responsible for North Korea’s current actions. It covers up the dangerous behaviour of this country”. It presents readers with the idea that Beijing is engaged in an obvious plot. Having been on the receiving end of criticism from Washington for its great-power policy, it has decided respond in this way. As proof, the Japanese refer to Chosun Ilbo, which reported that, according to a former employee of the United States Defense Intelligence Agency, Bruce Vector, whose opinion was published on September 1, the North Korean rocket is an exact copy of the Chinese Tszyuylan-1 two-stage solid-propellant ballistic missile, which is designed to be placed on submarines. Giving a lecture at the Seoul National University, the United States Deputy Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, also announced that the North Korean economy can not be discussed without mentioning China. Pyongyang is totally dependent on cooperation with Beijing, so China is particularly responsible for the implementation of sanctions against North Korea. The goal of such accusations is to force China to be “more constructive.” Meanwhile, Chinese politicians constantly state that the Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula is not caused by Beijing’s actions, and China cannot wave a magic wand and resolve the situation. The roots of the issue stem from conflicts between the USA and North Korea, and it is America who should demonstrate a constructive approach. On September 12, 2016, China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, noted that the core of the Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula is in the conflict between the USA and North Korea, and it is America who should take responsibility. “We once again call upon all the parties to look at the overall situation, to act with caution, to avoid mutual provocations, as well as to jointly promote denuclearization, and to make real efforts to achieve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula”, said the Chinese diplomat, noting that the current situation is testament to the real importance and urgency of returning to the six-party negotiations as soon as possible . On September 14, 2016, American suggestions that China should actively participate in isolating North Korea were rejected in Renmin Ribao Newspaper ( China ). The newspaper states that the prime responsibility for the current situation cannot be placed on North Korea, but on the United States. On September 21, in his speech at the UN, the Prime Minister of China, Li Keqiang, also did not mention sanctions. On November 2, 2016, Hua Chunying once again announced that it is not possible to achieve the fundamental solution of the Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula by sanctions and pressure alone. Commenting on the recent meeting of the heads of delegations from the USA and the Republic of Korea at the six-party negotiations, during which there were repeated calls to tighten sanctions and increase pressure against North Korea in the hope that the new resolution of the UN Security Council would introduce the forced restriction of North Korean coal exports, Hua Chunying said that the UN Security Council was considering and discussing the North Korean nuclear issue. However, a substantial part of UN Security Council Resolution 2270 refers to the need to resume the six-party negotiations and to seek to reduce tension in North-East Asia via political and diplomatic means. This is how a meaningful solution to the North Korean nuclear issue can be found . Two days later, on November 4, she stated that the deployment of the US Missile Defense System on the Korean Peninsula would undermine the strategic balance of forces in the region, and Beijing reserves the right to take the necessary measures to protect its own safety. The actions of the USA run contrary to the efforts to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, said Hua Chunying, calling on relevant parties to take China’s legitimate concerns into account. The heart of China’s policy is both the THAAD issue (seen by China as aimed at containing its missile capabilities) and the broader perception that US military preparations against North Korea are actually directed against China. As a result, despite a number of serious differences between the countries, relations between Beijing and Pyongyang are based on the principle of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”. It is easier to support North Korea, rather than risking more serious consequences that may occur if it were pressed too hard. China’s willingness to investigate illegal trade links between a number of Chinese companies and North Korea shows that “the window is not completely closed”, and it can be seen as an attempt to weaken US efforts to impose sanctions against Chinese companies that do legal business with North Korea. China and North Korea are simultaneously expanding economic cooperation despite the effects of international sanctions. According to the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the third meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission of North Korea and China was held in Pyongyang on October 25 where border issues were discussed. The Chinese party headed by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs – Liu Zhenmin, and the North Korean – the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs – Pak Myong-guk. Organising a new border crossing was discussed as a bridge between Sinuiju city (North Korea) and Hunchun city (China) was built this September. In addition, in the near future a bridge between Sinuiju city and Dandong city (China) will be opened. Besides, the trade turnover between North Korea and China in the third quarter of this year increased by 3.4% compared to the same period of last year. The Chinese are building new warehouses and offices in the Rason Special Economic Zone which means an inflow of investments. The import of cars from North Korea into China increased sharply. The import of Chinese rice also increased. According to the Customs Administration of China, in September 2016 18,477 tons of grain crops were delivered from China to North Korea. This is 2.7 times higher than in August, and 6 times higher than last September. In September, 16 thousand tons of rice were imported (2 thousand tons more than from January to August). Although South Korean experts explain this fact by the decision made by the North Korean leadership to stabilize prices for rice, as rice stocks in the past year have worn thin, any fact related to North Korea has been solely considered a sign of imminent starvation and collapse for some time now. In general, while one party is accusing the other and bearing its weapons, the other is looking for ways to resolve the issue, which clearly shows who could encourage dialogue but does not want to do so.

       "  \"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \\nPolice say they have caught the man they believe shot two Iowa police officers dead in what is being described as an “ambush-style” attack. \\nThe man behind the shooting is reportedly Scott Michael Greene, a 46-year-old Urbandale resident with a history of run-ins with the law, Confederate flag fetishism, and anger towards African Americans. He also has a recent obsession with Donald Trump. \\nIn a video allegedly posted by Greene and discovered by Buzzfeed , the soon-to-be cop killer records himself having an altercation with police officers on October 14. In a comment below the video, he says: \\n“I was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.” \\nIronically, the video mostly featured Greene yelling at various cops about his rights while they try to escort him from a high school property. A selfie taken at the game shows why witnesses found Greene to be disturbing the peace. Greene decided to bring his Confederate flag to the stands with him. \\nNaturally, Greene’s neighbors say he came out hard for Trump several weeks ago, even placing a large Trump/Pence 2016 sign in his yard. Neighbor tells me that shooting suspect Scott Michael Greene put this Trump sign in his yard approx 2 weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/8HjtthB51I \\n— Grant Rodgers (@GrantMRodgers) November 2, 2016 \\nNot exactly a surprising development considering the Republican candidates uncanny ability to collect endorsements from neo-Nazis, KKK leaders, and other hate groups. Also not surprising: The typically loud-mouthed Trump has been dead silent about the fact that his own supporter is allegedly involved in the execution of two police officers. Ditto for many of the same Republicans who rushed to baselessly blame Hillary Clinton and President Obama of inciting violence against cops every time they can. \\nIowa’s own Rep.

There were others. \\n— Steve King (@SteveKingIA) July 8, 2016 \\nBut only “prayers” for the victims in this latest shooting.

       " ['Will Trump Honor the Iran Nuclear Deal? - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  'Will Trump Honor the Iran Nuclear Deal? by Stephen Lendman The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is an international agreement involving the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany. Completing it successfully required many months of hard bargaining, Iran giving more than it got in return – to free itself from sanctions imposed solely for political reasons, serving US and Israeli interests mainly. Its nuclear program has no military component, not now or earlier, claims otherwise falsified. Since ending a generation of US-installed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi rule in 1979, Washington treated the Islamic Republic deplorably. It’s not at war with its neighbors, threatens no one, and advocates a nuclear-free Middle East – Israel the sole regional nuclear armed and dangerous nation, yet nothing is done to contest its arsenal, no JCPOA-type deal to eliminate it. Why challenge Iran? Because it’s a sovereign independent nation Washington doesn’t control. And there’s all their hydrocarbon riches Big Oil wants exploited for its own bottom line interests. On November 25, The Wall Street Journal reported Washington “and its Western allies…pressing pressing Iran to take steps to sharply cut the amount of radioactive material it holds in a bid to shore up last year’s nuclear deal and discourage the incoming Trump administration from abandoning it,” citing unnamed Western officials. Will Trump scrap or renegotiate JCPOA as vowed while campaigning? Highly unlikely. It’s an international agreement, America one of six countries involved plus Iran. Renegotiating what took many months to agree on would begin his tenure on the wrong foot, irresponsibly challenging the other permanent Security Council members plus Germany. He’s more likely to continue a hard line on Tehran in other ways, maintaining illegal US sanctions, maybe adding more, breaching the letter and spirit of JCPOA – instead of responsibly ending 37 years of hostility, treating Iranian sovereignty with the respect it deserves. Iran’s ambassador to the IAEA, Reza Najafi, warned against taking steps to undermine JCPOA terms, stressing Tehran’s full compliance, saying: “The P5+1 countries have a clear responsibility to abide by the JCPOA with good will and in a constructive atmosphere based on mutual respect and through avoiding any steps that run contrary to the text and spirit of the JCPOA and undermine its successful implementation.” Complaints about Tehran exceeding its agreed on heavy water inventory of 130 metric tons were overblown – the issue resolved when 11 tons were sent to Oman days earlier. IAEA director general Yukiya Amano confirmed Iran’s full compliance with JCPOA terms. Last April, he praised the Islamic Republic for exceeding its obligations under the agreement. Washington continues breaching it by maintaining sanctions, imposing new ones since JCPOA’s implementation in January, and failing to unfreeze all Iranian assets. Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

One of the Times Square celebrants, 36-year-old Brett Cleaver, said the night’s festivities had caused him to reflect on the past year and consider how tonight represented a fresh start. \\n“Beginning tomorrow, I’m going to try to cherish every second I have where I don’t hear the phrase ‘swing state’ or see footage from a campaign rally,” Cleaver told reporters, beaming at the prospect of never again looking at an article that speculated on how undecided voters would react to Donald Trump’s or Hillary Clinton’s latest statements. “For tonight, though, I’m just soaking up as much of this moment as I can.” \\nAdded Cleaver, “I’m already excited to come back and do this again in 2020.” Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter \\nGive your spam filter something to do.

       "  \"Share on Twitter \\nJoanne Liberato had noticed a few unusual things about her son Eddie. He seemed to bruise more easily than his older brother, and his cuts took too long to heal. However, nothing seemed worthy of panic until the day when a minor fall turned into a major injury. \\nIf Joanne hadn't followed her instincts, her toddler might have died. Image Credit: Flickr CC/ Damien Ayers \\nAccording to Kidspot , it was eighteen-month-old Eddie's penchant for copying his older brother that led to the accident. Although neither boy was allowed to play on the couch, three-year-old Joel often did so anyway. \\nWhen Eddie climbed up there himself, his mom called out for him to stop and ran to grab him. Unfortunately, she was too late to catch his fall. She tells Kidspot: \\n“It was a heart-stopping moment, but then he started crying a second later and I thought he must be okay, people always say if they cry it means they’re okay.” \\nTo Joanne's relief, Eddie didn't seem to have any injuries. However, his cries and the slight swelling she noticed on his head made her uneasy, so the worried mom followed her intuition and took her son to the hospital. Loading Facebook Post... \\nAt first, it seemed as though she had overreacted. After being under observation for four hours, Eddie seemed fine and his mother was ready to take him home. But when the toddler began vomiting, a doctor ordered a CAT scan. Suddenly, Joanne was extremely grateful they hadn't left the hospital earlier. She tells Kidspot: \\n“They said he had bleeding on the brain and he had to be flown to Lady Cilento Hosptial in Brisbane for emergency surgery. All I could think was, 'what if I had gone home?' I could have lost him.” \\nAfter Eddie's emergency surgery, doctors were disturbed to see that excessive bleeding was preventing his wound from healing properly. That's when Joanne told the doctors about her son's tendency to bruise and have cuts that bled for too long. \\nThe mom's recollection spurred new tests that revealed Eddie had hemophilia, a rare disorder that prevents blood from clotting. The discovery saved his life : \\n“If they didn't stop the bleeding he would have passed away.” \\nUnfortunately, that was only the beginning of the complications the courageous boy would face. Two successive infections required an operation to remove a portion of infected skull. This was followed by multiple blood transfusions and forty stitches in his head. \\nNow, Eddie has to wait several months for surgery that will put a plate on his skull to protect his brain. In the meantime, a GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family with his medical costs. Loading Facebook Post... \\nEddie must wear a helmet to protect his fragile head and avoid rough play. His mother tells the Sunshine Coast Daily that keeping the active toddler safe can be stressful: \\n“It's very hard for him, he just wants to run around with his brother and have fun. I'm living on tenterhooks watching over him.” \\nStill, after everything her son has been through, Joanne says it's amazing how well Eddie has coped with his injuries. She tells Kidspot: \\n“He’s just an absolute trooper, I’m really proud of how he’s handled everything.” \"],\n",

But the shade he threw on Newt Gingrich after his rant against Megyn Kelly was nothing short of scorching. \\n“I’m sick and tired of people like you using language that’s inflammatory, that’s not true!” Gingrich exploded on The Kelly File. “When you use the words, you took a position. And I think it’s very unfair of you to do that!” \\nThen, the former Speaker went for the throat: \\n“You wanna go back through the tapes of your show recently? You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy! That’s what I get out of watching you tonight!” \\nAnderson Cooper noticed something unusual about Gingrich's line of attack: \\n“For Newt Gingrich to accuse Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex,” Cooper stated. “This is a guy, who’s what, on his third marriage, cheated on his first two wives and was having an affair when he was impeaching Bill Clinton.

Close Black-hearted Americans across the country reportedly celebrated in the streets after Donald Trump was declared the victor, becoming the first black-hearted president in the nation’s history. NEWS November 9, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 44 · Politics · Politicians · Election 2016 · Donald Trump \\nWASHINGTON—Shattering a barrier long thought unbreakable in the United States, Donald Trump, the 70-year-old billionaire real estate mogul from New York, became the first black-hearted man in history to win the American presidency, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. \\nPresident-elect Trump, who in July became the first black-hearted nominee of a major political party, once again rewrote the history books as the first black-hearted man to capture the majority of votes in the electoral college, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a closely contested race. The once unimaginable outcome of a black-hearted man assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the United States has already sent major shockwaves through the nation and, indeed, across the world. \\n“Honestly, I’m in shock—I cannot believe that we just elected a black-hearted man as president of the United States,” said Stephen Payton, 49, of Greensboro, NC, adding that just the thought of a black-hearted man sitting in the Oval Office “sent chills down [his] spine.” “Frankly, I never thought I’d live to see us put a man like that in the White House, but I guess times do change. Our nation is clearly moving in a new direction.” \\n“It just goes to show you that anything is possible in America,” he continued. \\nTrump’s victory, which defied the long-held conventional wisdom about the prospects of black-hearted candidates, has been described as a watershed moment for the nation’s millions of black-hearted Americans whose overwhelming support buoyed his run for the presidency. Encouraged by the possibility of one of their own occupying the highest seat of power in the nation, black-hearted Americans reportedly turned out in record numbers in all 50 states, propelling Trump to a historic victory. \\nPerhaps most critically, early analysis indicates that Trump’s win may have been sealed by his ability to capture the votes of millions of Americans who were long assumed to be incapable of ever voting for a black-hearted candidate. \\n“Having someone who is black-hearted running the country is definitely going to change everything,” said Samantha Davis, 56, of Tacoma, WA, who explained that she expects Trump to govern in accordance with the values and beliefs shaped by his formative years growing up as a young black-hearted man in New York City. “There’s no way he’s going to be like any of the other men who came before him. He’s proud to be a black-hearted man because that’s exactly who he is.” \\n“And that won’t change just because he’s the president,” she added. \\nWhile no official announcements have been made, Washington insiders believe that Trump is also expected to name black-hearted Americans to fill key cabinet positions, with sources identifying former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as likely choices for top roles. \\nReflecting on the historic nature of the evening and what it may mean for the future, many have described Trump’s election as perhaps the single greatest achievement in black-hearted history. \\n“Oh my God, he actually won!” said Kyle Leigh, 27, of Watertown, NY, before pausing and breaking down in tears after learning that a black-hearted man will now occupy the White House for the next four or eight years. “This really happened. It’s just starting to sink in.” \\n“Nothing is going to be the same after this election,” he added. “Nothing.” Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter \\nGive your spam filter something to do.

They also asked the senators for more reliable funding, saying the uncertainty was hurting the defense industry. \\n“Not only our people – our defense industry partners, too, need stability and longer-term plans to be as efficient and cutting-edge as we need them to be,” Carter told the senators. Speaking about #sequester at #SASC , Ash Carter said it was unfair to \"defense industry partners\" too. pic.twitter.com/tQvNE4FWRc — Nebojsa Malic (@NebojsaMalic) September 22, 2016 \\nThe lawmakers were far less interested in the war against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) than about the future of the Syrian government, Iran’s “malign influence,” and “aggression” by China and Russia – all ranked far ahead of terrorism on Carter and Dunford’s list of security challenges. \\nThe Pentagon had “no intention” of sharing intelligence with Russia when it came to Syria, Dunford told the lawmakers unequivocally. Secretary Carter explained that the joint implementation councils envisioned by the ceasefire proposal negotiated in Geneva wouldn’t share intelligence, just coordinate efforts – but that they were a moot point anyway, since the ceasefire was effectively dead. \\nREAD MORE: AP leaks one of the 5 Syria ceasefire docs, Moscow says always wanted them public \\nBoth the lawmakers and the Pentagon chiefs blamed that development on Russia, focusing on the alleged airstrike against the humanitarian convoy in east Aleppo while the US-led airstrike against the Syrian Army fighting IS in Deir ez-Zor went unmentioned. \\n“I don’t have the facts,” Dunford said, when asked about the convoy attack by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut). “It was either the Russians or the regime,” he added. \\n“There is no doubt in my mind that the Russians are responsible,” whether directly or because they backed the government in Damascus, Dunford said, describing the attack as “an unacceptable atrocity.” \\nCarter explained Dunford’s logic in a response to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), saying that “the Russians are responsible for this strike whether they conducted it or not, because they took responsibility for the conduct of the Syrians by associating themselves with the Syrian regime.” Read more US airstrikes on Syrian troops were ‘intentional,’ lasted nearly 1 hour – Assad to AP \\nThe latest proposal by Secretary of State John Kerry involves grounding only Syrian and Russian airplanes, Carter told Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-New Hampshire). \\n“There can be no question of grounding US aircraft” over Syria, he said, adding that US jets conduct their strikes “with exceptional precision… that no other country can match.” \\nSen. Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) asked about what it would take for the US to impose a no-fly zone over Syria, using the phrase “control the airspace.” \\n“Right now… for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia,” Dunford replied, drawing a rebuke from committee chairman John McCain (R-Arizona), who argued a no-fly zone was possible without war. \\nAsked about the video of US-backed Syrian rebels insulting US Special Forces in Al-Rai and running them out of the northern Syrian town, Carter and Dunford shrugged it off. \\nREAD MORE: ‘Crusaders! Infidels! Dogs! Get out!’ US-backed rebels force US commandos to leave Syrian town \\nA “very small minority took verbal action” against US troops, said Dunford, who admitted he did not watch the video but had discussed it with US commanders. He said the incident was “irrelevant” because the US-backed forces and Turkey were making “great progress” along Syria’s northern border. — RT America (@RT_America) September 21, 2016 \\nIn their exchange with Graham, Carter and Dunford confirmed there is a plan to arm the Kurdish militia in Syria, over Turkish objections, as a way of advancing on the IS stronghold of Raqqa. Once Raqqa is taken, however, an Arab force would be required to hold it. “We have a plan,” Dunford said, but described it as “not resourced.” \\nDunford agreed with Graham’s assertion that the US had two objectives – to destroy IS and to “remove Assad,” referring to the Syrian president – but admitted the Kurds were not interested in the latter. \\n“If the main fighting force inside of Syria is not signed up to take Assad out, where does that force come from?” Graham asked. Neither Dunford nor Carter had an answer to that. \\nBoth the Pentagon heads and the lawmakers agreed throughout the hearing that caps on military spending mandated by sequestration were harmful and needed to be repealed. Lack of funding posed a significant threat to readiness and maintenance, Carter and Dunford argued, before pointing out that the US military was still the strongest, most powerful and most competent in the world.

       " ['8 More States Legalize Marijuana: Will Donald Trump Let It Stand? · Guardian Liberty Voice',\n",
       "  'Follow on Facebook Subscribe by Email Print This Post \\nThe legalization of marijuana, in some form, was a ballot initiative in nine states, on Nov. 8, 2016. Five of the nine states voted for recreational use and the other four were focused on medicinal purposes. \\nCalifornia, Nevada, Maine, and Massachusetts passed the recreational use of cannabis. These states join the ranks with Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and D.C. Arizona still offers legal medical marijuana but recreational use was voted down by 51.9 percent. \\nFlorida, North Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas voted to join the 24 other states that have legalized the use of the plant. New Recreational Marijuana States and Laws: Massachusetts: Recreational use, sale, possession, and cultivation of cannabis have been legalized. The law faced opposition from both sides of the isle. Republican Governor Charlie Baker and Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh joined Attorney General Maura Healey, in March, for a Boston Globe op-ed. The state had decriminalized the use of weed for recreational use. It was also legalized for medicinal use, in 2012. Healey, Baker, and Walsh met to discuss this matter and agreed that the plant should not be easily accessible or sold commercially. The voters in Massachusetts were divided. The recreational use of marijuana was supported by 54 percent. The new law will go into effect December 15. Cannabis sales will follow the same requirements as alcohol. California: Proposition 64 was viewed as the most important among the legalization issues on the ballot. Fifty-six percent of the voters agreed with the initiative, for people 21 and over. This not only completes recreational use of the plant on the West Coast, it benefits the state with the sixth-largest world economy. Cannabis legalization passed despite opposition from Senator Dianne Feinstein and Governor Jerry Brown. In 2014, Brown said: \\nHow many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation? \\nThe win of Proposition 64, does not simply allow for the commercial sale of marijuana, it rolled back the period of incarceration for thousands of people convicted on marijuana-related charges. The proposition went into effect at 12:01 a.m., on November 9. Residents can grow as many as six plants in their homes. However, it will not be available is stores until Jan. 1, 2018. Driving under the influence of and smoking marijuana in public will remain illegal. Those who break this law will be charged a $100 fine. Nevada: Recreational use, cultivation, possession, and commercial sales of the plant passed with 54 percent. The law pertains to adults, 21 and over. Most of the state is conservative, and until residents helped elect Obama, in 2008 and 2012, it was considered a Red state. However, the legalization of cannabis was opposed by Democratic Senator Harry Reid and Republican Governor Brian Sandoval. Regardless, on Jan. 1, 2018, medical marijuana dispensaries will be able to apply for a license that will allow them to sell the plant products to anyone, 21 or older. Only the dispensaries will be eligible to sell cannabis. Maine: It is legal for adults, 21 and over, to use cannabis for recreational use. People can cultivate, possess, and purchase marijuana. The legislation barely passed with 50.3 percent. The state will add a 10 percent sales tax on recreational cannabis. The new law will allow for retail stores and social clubs, as long as they are licensed and permitted in the municipalities where they grow. \\nMany states, including D.C., have opted to decriminalize recreational use of marijuana to save money. During an interview, in March, President Obama told Vice News that incarcerating people for marijuana-related charges is expensive. It was his hope, that if enough states decriminalized possession and use, Congress would reschedule the drug. \\nLegalization creates a new economy around the sales of marijuana and cannabis-infused lotions, oils, edibles, and related paraphernalia. Tax revenues have significantly increased in the states that have legalized recreational use of the plant. \\nTax revenue from marijuana sales in Colorado was $70 million in the last fiscal year. This was twice the amount collected from alcohol sales over the same period. In 2013, cannabis sales were at $1.5 billion. The revenue grew to $2.7 billion, in 2015. Cannabis investment and research firm ArcView Group believes that if all 50 states and D.C. were to completely legalize the plant, it is possible the U.S. will gain $35 billion in revenue, by 2020. What Will Trump Do? \\nDespite the economic boost the legalization of marijuana can bring to the U.S., there is a doubt that President-elect Donald Trump will be supportive. Leslie Bocskor, the president and founder of Electrum Partners, called the future leader of the U.S., “a boogie man of unparalleled size and fearsomeness to the legal cannabis industry.” His election could prevent the recall of the Controlled Substances Act, that Obama and many Americans wanted. \\nThe marijuana wins gained in the 2016 election means that now, 60 million Americans will not be arrested, lose student loans, or their children for using the plant at the state level. It is still against federal law to use or possess cannabis. \\nExecutive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance Ethan Nadelmann said that he cannot predict what Trump will do concerning marijuana or the Controlled Substances Act. In 1990, Trump was for the legalization of all drugs, regardless, he leaned heavily on the Republican drug-war rhetoric in political debates. \\nNevertheless, Trump told the International Association of Chiefs of Police that marijuana was an issue for individual states to handle. He agreed that Congress should re-write certain laws to be compatible with the state laws. Lobbyists believe that any impact on the use of cannabis will depend on who Trump chooses for members of his Cabinet. \\nAt one time, it was possible that Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, would hold the position of U.S. Attorney General. He delayed the limited legalization of medical marijuana, as the governor of New Jersey. Throughout his own run as a Republican candidate for president, Christie spoke of enforcing federal law against cannabis. However, his involvement in the Bridgegate scandal could force Trump to look, instead, at the former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani for U.S. Attorney General. \\nGiuliani was also a federal prosecutor. When he was mayor, more people were arrested (per capita), in New York City, for marijuana-related charges, than any other American city. This makes him another unwanted choice for those who use the plant, in any form, for any reason. Hope for Cannabis in America \\nThere is no need for weed-lovers to lose heart, reminds Professor Marsha Cohen, from UC Hastings College of the Law, in San Francisco. She stated that the Department of Justice cannot change things overnight; it would take time, organization, and money for Trump to crackdown on marijuana use nationwide. However, it may not matter who becomes the next attorney general. \\nCongress, led by Paul Ryan, has consistently denied funding for the Justice Department to impede on states that legalize cannabis. Despite the desires of the new attorney general, it is likely Congress will continue to prevent federal meddling at the state-level. \\nCohen pointed out that Florida voted in favor of the new medical marijuana law and Trump with the same ballot. Therefore, it is uncertain what he will do, as president, concerning the use of the plant. Cohen stated that cannabis is a political issue and will remain such; it is possible that weed has become too popular to undo. \\nBy Jeanette Smith \\nSources: \\nBusiness insider: 4 states just voted to make marijuana completely legal — here’s what we know News.MIC: Where Is Marijuana Legal in the United States?

In fact, some of them could even be harmful. \\nWhat is even more disturbing than the falsity of our assumptions is the reason why they are “common knowledge” in the first place. For instance, we know that the normal human diet consists of three meals a day and occasional snacks. Right? \\nThe common assumption that we should eat three times a day, without fasting, may not actually be backed by science. Instead of research and scientific study, this assumption could be fueled by money. Lots and lots of money. \\nThis was the topic of recent TED Talks discussion with Professor Mark Mattson. Professor Mattson is a professor of Neuroscience at John Hopkins University. He is also the Chief of the Laboratory of Neuroscience at the National Institute of Aging. He is one of the foremost researchers in the study of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disorder and Alzheimer’s disease. Professor Mattson has received multiple awards and accolades for his contributions to these fields including Alzheimer’s Association Zenith Award. \\nSo basically, he’s pretty smart when it comes to brain stuff. During the TEDx, Professor Mattson described his research into fasting and the positive effects it could have on the human brain. It is a fascinating subject that makes one wonder why it is not more commonly discussed. Professor Mattson also delves into the reason for this, and it is a bit unsettling. Neurological Disorders \\nAccording to the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America , 5.1 million people in the United States may have Alzheimer’s disease as of 2015. Research shows that the the chance of developing Alzheimer’s doubles every five years over the age of 65. \\nAs the population is aging– particularly in the instance of the Baby Boomers– the incidence of the Alzheimer’s is rising. Between 2010 and 2050, the number of Americans over the age of 65 will increase by more than double. The number of people over the age of 85 will increase by more than triple. \\nAccording to Professor Mattson, the number of Americans with Alzheimer’s will triple by 2050. The disease does not only effect seniors or the elderly. It is estimated that over 500,000 people in the United States have some form of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. This is commonly referred to as “early onset” dementia. \\nOnce it develops, it is estimated that between one to four family members are required to act as caregivers to the individual with the disease. Even if you are not personally impacted by the disease, you probably know someone who is. There is also an increasing chance that you will be affected as you get older. \\nAlthough it is not as prevalent, there are similar statistics for other neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease . Currently, nearly one million people in the United States are affected by Parkinson’s, and the number is rising. Every year, nearly 60,000 new cases of Parkinson’s disease are diagnosed in the U.S. alone. \\nThe average age for the onset of the disorder is 60, but symptoms can progress for periods of longer than 20 years. Early onset instances of Parkinson’s disease generally occur around age 50 and account for approximately five to ten percent of diagnosed cases. \\nThese numbers do not even include other neurological disorders such as muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease). Overall, it is estimated that over 6.1 million Americans suffer from some form of neurological disorder such as these. \\nAs of now, there is no known cure for any of them. That is why any possible method of prevention is vital. According to Professor Mattson, he believes he has found a way to do just that. Fasting and Reducing Caloric Intake \\nProfessor Mattson and his team have done extensive research and published multiple papers on how reducing caloric intake can extend lifespan. In his TEDx discussion, he mentions that they were able to increase the lifespan of laboratory animals by 30 to 40 percent simply by reducing how much they eat. This was due to slower degeneration of brain cells by energy intake. \\nWhile he does not simply state one should eat less to live longer, Professor Mattson does believe that periodic fasting can have a similar effect in humans. For centuries, humans have believed fasting to have both physical and spiritual benefits. As far back as Plato, anecdotal evidence exists of periodic fasting being a key factor in people living extended life. In Upton Sinclair’s 1911 book “ The Fasting Cure ,” he discusses several real-life instances of people who have experienced positive health results and recovered from disease as a result of fasting. \\nThe reason Professor Mattson believes that fasting has positive results for your brain is due to how your brain reacts to stress. During times of fasting, your brain will become stressed and develop “adaptive stress response pathways” that will help it cope with the lack of energy. These adaptation help your brain remain strong and resist neurological disease. \\nThere is also evidence of this in evolutionary terms. When an animal is deprived of food, its brain will activate these adaptive stress response pathways. Basically, it is a mechanism of the brain telling the animal: “Go get me some food.” \\nIn this way, fasting has similar effects as exercising. Like physical exertion, fasting creates a psychological challenge and stimulates the creation of neurotrophic factors. These are sciencey thingies that can help prevent the degeneration of nerve cells in your brain and even, in one of the brain, help to generate new ones. Fasting will also help to create “ketones” in the brain that provide an alternative fuel and increase the metabolism of the brain. \\nBasically, fasting causes your brain to exercise. Through this exercise, it grows stronger in its ability to fight degenerative diseases and retain cognitive abilities. So, why don’t we know this stuff? \\nAccording to Professor Mattson: \\n“Why is it that the normal diet is three meals a day plus snacks? It isn’t that it’s the healthiest eating pattern, now that’s my opinion but I think there is a lot of evidence to support that. There are a lot of pressures to have that eating pattern, there’s a lot of money involved. The food industry — are they going to make money from skipping breakfast like I did today? No, they’re going to lose money. If people fast, the food industry loses money. What about the pharmaceutical industries? What if people do some intermittent fasting, exercise periodically and are very healthy, is the pharmaceutical industry going to make any money on healthy people?” \\nAs he stated, this is only his opinion, but there is evidence that indicates the possibility of pharmaceutical companies interfering with medical research. \\nIn an article titled “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False,” John P.A. Ioannidis of the Stanford University School of Medicine argues just that. Particularly relating to the influence of large corporations and pharmaceutical companies in research, Ioannidis states a research finding is less likely to be true when there is “greater financial and other interest and prejudice.” \\nIoannidis also found that many current research studies simply reinforce current assumptions or prove the prevailing bias. Ionnadis and Mattson are far from alone in these beliefs. The Editor and Chief of The Lancet Dr. Richard Horton recently published a similar study showing that much of the scientific literature published today is either inaccurate, biased or simply untrue. According to Dr. Marcia Angell , the former Editor in Chief at the New England Journal of Medicine, “[the] pharmaceutical industry likes to depict itself as a research-based industry, as the source of innovative drugs. Nothing could be further from the truth.” \\nThe increasingly common belief that many of our common beliefs could be untrue is unsettling, to say the least. It has long been an accepted fact that financial gains influence almost every aspect of our culture, so it should not be hard to believe that they influence health research. Fasting for Brain Power \\nIf Professor Mattson and his team are correct about how reducing caloric intake can improve and protect our cognitive abilities, you will probably want to start doing so. However, it is important to be responsible and not just stop eating because you heard it would help your brain. If you did that, you might not have the best of brains anyway. \\nThere are many modern diets that already stress the importance of fasting and the health benefits that come with it. The method that Professor Mattson recommends is what is called the “5:2 Diet” method of fasting. Simply put, this involves eating normally for five days of the week and fasting for two. On the fasting days, you would eat approximately one quarter of the calories you eat on your regular days. \\nAs is the case with any new changes to your health habits, it is important to check with your doctor first. Particularly if you plan on implementing a big change like periodic fasting, it is also smart to do your research first. There are several books an millions of articles available on the subject to help you find which method works for you. Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment '],\n",

       "  ' Trump Warns That By Attacking Assad, US Will \\x91End Up Fighting Russia\\x92 By RT November 13, \" RT \" - US President-elect Donald Trump has confirmed that he will most likely abandon the Obama administration policy on Syria to seek a possible rapprochement with Russia on the issue of Assad.\\n\\x93I\\x92ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria,\\x94 the 70-year-old Republican told the Wall Street Journal in his first interview since the election.\\nFrom the start of the Syrian war, Barack Obama\\x92s foreign policy has been focused on the support and training of the so-called \\x93moderate\\x94 rebel groups who were supposed to defeat Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorists, and survive to eventually overthrow Assad. That approach became deadlocked this year when Washington failed to honor its obligations under an agreement with Moscow to separate their moderate rebel forces from internationally-recognized terrorists.\\nTrump, on the other hand, said on Friday that the US should be focused on fighting Islamic State, instead of pursuing regime change in Syria.\\n\\x93My attitude was you\\x92re fighting Syria, Syria is fighting ISIS, and you have to get rid of ISIS. Russia is now totally aligned with Syria, and now you have Iran, which is becoming powerful, because of us, is aligned with Syria... Now we\\x92re backing rebels against Syria, and we have no idea who these people are.\\x94\\nIt has been widely documented and reported that American weapons supplied to the moderate rebels are often obtained by extremists in Syria. Those weapons, in turn, are being used by the jihadists to strike civilian positions and deploy them against Syrian forces.\\nThe president-elect warned that if the US attacks Assad, \\x93we end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria.\\x94\\nThe US coalition bombing of Syrian Army positions near the city of Deir el-Zour on September 17 led to the collapse of the US-Russian peace initiative.\\nRapprochement in US-Russia ties could, however, be on the horizon after Trump admitted receiving a \\x93beautiful\\x94 letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said a phone call between them is scheduled shortly.\\nDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin are \\x93very much alike... in their basic approaches toward international affairs,\\x94 Dmitry Peskov told the Associated Press earlier.\\n\\x93[Trump] has been a very firm supporter of the idea of a good relationship between our countries, because we do carry a joint responsibility for strategic stability in the world, strategic security,\\x94 the spokesman said.\\nImmediately after Trump\\'s victory, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Moscow looks forward to restoring bilateral relations with the United States.\\nThe US military establishment, however, already seems to be working against Trump\\'s policies. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Defense Secretary Ash Carter leveled a barrage of accusations at Russia.\\nHe said the Russian campaign in Syria \\x93fuels the fires\\x94 of ongoing violence in the country, claiming \\x93they\\x92re not doing what we need to do and think needs to be done [in Syria].\\x94\\n\\x93What the Russians said, if you\\x92ll remember, was that they were going to come in and fight terrorism and help remove Assad,\\x94 Carter said. \\x93They haven\\x92t done either of those things. They haven\\'t done any of that.\\x94\\nWhile Moscow has been undertaking efforts to eliminate Islamic State and Al-Nusra Front terrorists in Syria, it never said it would take part in the forcible removal of President Bashar Assad.\\nWhen the anchor Norah O\\x92Donnell said \\x93They\\'re helping Assad?\\x94 Carter continued, \\x93Exactly. Which in turn simply fuels the fires of the Syrians civil war. So the Russians have been completely backwards there, in what they\\'ve been doing.\\n\\x93So we have not been able to, and I have not been in favor, and am not recommending to the president that we associate ourselves with or work with the Russians until they start doing the right thing,\\x94 Carter concluded.'],\n",

The groups will consist of 40,000 forces. It will be the biggest military buildup near Russia since the Second World War. More forces would also be deployed if necessary. \\n“This is credible deterrence. Not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent conflict,” Stoltenberg claimed contradictorily on Tuesday, referring to the planned deployments near Russia. “Concrete proof that NATO can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies. And a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.” \\nThe United States, Germany, Britain, and Canada have already agreed to contribute forces to the “battle groups,” which are to be deployed to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.

       "  'Pinterest \\nAttorney General Loretta Lynched promised this July that she would press charges against Hillary Clinton if recommended by the FBI. \\nAs more details emerge regarding Clinton’s use of a private server during her time as Secretary of State, and a new investigation by the FBI opening only days before the election, Lynch’s promise has taken on renewed significance. \\nThe Daily Caller reports: \\nThe New York Times reported Friday that the emails were obtained from a device belonging to either longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin, or her estranged husband, former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation for sending illicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl. \\nSo far, Lynch has remained silent on Comey’s announcement regarding the newly discovered emails. \\nLynch was the subject of public scrutiny after it was revealed that she and Bill Clinton met for 30 minutes on an airplane runway at the end of June. \\nLynch admitted that the meeting “cast a shadow” over the investigation, before making her promise to accept the FBI’s recommendations. \\nWhen the FBI requested to open up a public integrity investigation into the Clinton Foundation, however, the Department of Justice (which is headed up by Lynch) declined, claiming there was insufficient evidence to open an investigation. \\nNew details have already emerged that prove relevant to the FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton. That, in fact, is why the case was re-opened yesterday. \\nIf those new details prove particularly damning for Hillary, the FBI could very well recommend criminal charges against the former Secretary of State and current Democratic nominee for president. \\nWorse yet, that FBI recommendation could come before the election. \\nWhether or not she intends to keep the promise she made four months ago, the spotlight will certainly then fall on Lynch to act and act fast. \\nWhat she’ll do next is anyone’s guess. \\nBut keep in mind Lynch is an Obama appointee.

       "  ' Donald Trump Likely to End Aid for Rebels Fighting Syrian Government\\nBy DAVID E. SANGER November 13, \" NYT \" - WASHINGTON \\x97 President-elect Donald J. Trump said Friday that he was likely to abandon the American effort to support \\x93moderate\\x94 opposition groups in Syria who are battling the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying \\x93we have no idea who these people are.\\x94\\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal that dealt largely with economic issues, including his willingness to retain parts of the Affordable Care Act, he repeated a position he took often during his campaign: that the United States should focus on defeating the Islamic State, and find common ground with the Syrians and their Russian backers.\\n\\x93I\\x92ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria,\\x94 Mr. Trump told The Journal. \\x93My attitude was you\\x92re fighting Syria, Syria is fighting ISIS, and you have to get rid of ISIS. Russia is now totally aligned with Syria, and now you have Iran, which is becoming powerful, because of us, is aligned with Syria.\\x94\\nHis comments suggest that once Mr. Trump begins overseeing both the public support for the opposition groups, and a far larger covert effort run by the Central Intelligence Agency, he may wind down or abandon the effort. But there are in fact two wars going on simultaneously in Syria.\\nOne is against the Islamic State, in which the United States is supporting 30,000 Syrian-Kurdish and Syrian-Arab fighters, who last weekend announced they were opening a new phase of the battle, beginning to encircle the ISIS capital in Raqqa. There are roughly 300 United States Special Operations forces on the ground assisting these militia.\\nThe second effort is in support of rebels fighting Mr. Assad. The C.I.A. covert program is by far the largest conduit of support, providing antitank missiles to rebels fighting the government. That is the program that Mr. Trump seems most intent on ending. If the United States pursues that line, \\x93We end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria,\\x94 Mr. Trump told The Journal.\\nThe argument for ending the support may be bolstered by the fact that, as a matter of survival, those opposition groups have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of Al Qaeda in Syria, formerly known as Al Nusra. This has had the effect of allowing Mr. Assad and Russia to argue that they are attacking Al Qaeda, and the United States should aid them in that effort. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that argument during his ultimately failed effort to reach a deal for a cease-fire and an ultimate settlement.\\nMr. Trump\\x92s the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend logic is consistent with what he said during the campaign. \\x93I\\x92m not saying Assad is a good man, \\x91cause he\\x92s not,\\x94 he told The New York Times in an interview in March, \\x93but our far greater problem is not Assad, it\\x92s ISIS.\\x94\\nBut it also takes a position that will gratify President Vladimir V. Putin, because it suggests that rather than pressure Russia to end its support of Mr. Assad, a Trump administration will get out of Mr. Putin\\x92s way.\\nIn another hint of a major change in policy, one of Mr. Trump\\x92s primary national security advisers, Lt. General Michael T. Flynn, the retired head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, wrote in The Hill newspaper this week that the United States should extradite Fethullah Gulen who Turkey has demanded should be sent back from his exile in Pennsylvania. The Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed him for a coup attempt over the summer.\\nThe Justice Department has not yet concluded that there is any convincing evidence that Mr. Gulen should be sent back to almost certain confinement or execution under an extradition treaty with the United States. They see the request as part of Mr. Erdogan\\x92s effort to eliminate all opposition.\\nMr. Flynn adopted many of Turkey\\x92s arguments about Mr. Gulen, arguing that \\x93American taxpayers are helping finance Gulen\\x92s 160 charter schools\\x94 in the United States, and that it is more important to support Turkey than be \\x93hoodwinked by this masked source of terror and instability nestled comfortably in our own backyard.\\x94\\nEric Schmitt contributed reporting. President Assad: Syria is ready to co-operate with Donald Trump : The US is currently enmeshed in a complicated alliance in Syria with Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who would like to provide rebels \\x96 among them al-Qaeda-backed factions \\x96 with surface-to-air missiles. What will Trump do on Syria?: The US should get out of the war in Syria and avoid destabilising more Middle Eastern countries, and the US should work with Putin to defeat terrorist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).'],\n",

       "  '09:01 EST, 12 November 2016 | Updated: 18:54 EST, 12 November 2016 A flotilla of Russian warships is now in the eastern Mediterranean off the Syrian coast after being sent to back up a bombing campaign in support of President Bashar al-Assad. The commander of Russia’s flagship Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, Sergei Artamonov, said via videolink that the ships are now in the ‘designated zone… in the eastern Mediterranean’ and ‘are now jointly carrying out tasks, manoeuvering to the west of the Syrian coast’. The battle group has travelled to Syria from the North Sea through the English Channel in the biggest such naval deployment in recent years as part of Russia’s military intervention in Syria. Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov pictured in international waters off the coast of northern Norway last month Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, pictured in the Englist Channel, is part of the Russian Task Group, which includes the sole the nuclear powered Kirov Class Battlecruiser, Pyotr Velikiy and two Udaloy Class Destroyers, Vice Admiral Kulakov and Severomorsk Russia has been flying a bombing campaign in Syria for the past year in support of President Bashar al-Assad and has deployed a naval contingent to back up its operation. The naval task force has been monitored closely by NATO, whose chief Jens Stoltenberg voiced concern the ships would be used to support the Russian military operation in Syria and ‘increase human and civilian suffering.’ The ship’s commander was speaking to a presenter on Russia-1 television from inside the defence ministry for a news show that will air this evening in Moscow. The Russian warship ‘Mirage’ passes the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul on its way to Syria He confirmed that aircraft are already taking off from the ship’s deck to view the conflict zone. ‘Flights are being carried out from the deck… they are working on coordination with the shore port,’ he said. ‘The flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days,’ he added. HMS Richmond observing aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, which is part of a Russian task group, during transit through the North Sea Russia’s Interfax news agency on Friday had cited a Russian military and diplomatic source as saying that Russian MiG and Sukhoi jets have been regularly flying into Syrian airspace from the Kuznetsov to ‘determine combat missions.’ The Russian television channel also spoke to the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, which is part of the same flotilla. Asked whether foreign aircraft were flying over the ships, the commander, Vladislav Malakhovsky, said ‘they are afraid to come closer than 50 kilometres away, realising very well how powerful the nuclear cruiser is.’ – Seeks UN assurances on truces – Russia says it has ceased strikes on rebel-held east Aleppo since October 18 and has also held brief unilateral ceasefires on the ground it calls ‘humanitarian pauses.’ It has accused the United States-led coalition of failing to persuade rebels to cooperate to allow civilians to leave, as only a few have done so. The Russian defence ministry on Saturday said that it will introduce further ‘humanitarian pauses’ only on condition that the United Nations humanitarian mission guarantees it is ready and able to organise aid supplies and evacuations. The UN has warned that east Aleppo is now down to its final food supplies and has urged Russia to extend future truces to allow supplies through. Russia said Saturday it is ready to act ‘at any time’ as long as the UN ‘officially confirms its readiness and ability to supply humanitarian aid to Aleppo and evacuate wounded and sick peaceful residents.’ It complained that previous assurances from the UN had turned out to be ‘just words.’ Vehicles carrying humanitarian aid that try to enter the designated humanitarian passages into the city have ‘every time’ faced ‘shooting from the rebel fighters’ and have been unable to drive through because of mined roads, the ministry said.

       "  \"More Election Coverage Anthropologists Discover Isolated Tribe Of Joyful Americans Living In Remote Village Untouched By 2016 Election Researchers say the newly discovered tribe scored the highest on the Gross National Happiness Index of any society they have ever studied. Close Researchers say the newly discovered tribe scored the highest on the Gross National Happiness Index of any society they have ever studied. NEWS October 28, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 42 · Politics · Politicians · Election 2016 \\nWALDPORT, OR—A team of anthropologists announced Friday it had discovered an isolated tribe of blissful Americans who have never been exposed to the current presidential campaign or its candidates, noting that the newly identified population lives contentedly in a remote village completely untouched by the 2016 race. \\nAccording to researchers from Lewis & Clark College, the peaceful, secluded community along the outskirts of Oregon’s Drift Creek Wilderness remains uncontacted by political canvassers, pollsters, and the election media, allowing its generally cheerful and affable inhabitants to go about their daily lives without ever encountering a political poll, election news story, campaign ad, soundbite, or stump speech. \\n“Upon first entering the village, we immediately noticed how relaxed and upbeat the inhabitants appeared, but it wasn’t until speaking with them directly that we understood how insulated they were from the country’s political climate,” said professor Elizabeth Letts, adding that the tribe’s levels of stress, depression, and anxiety were far lower than those recorded over the past 18 months among the broader American populace. “They actually seem to lead gratifying, well-balanced lives. The adults enjoy eight hours of sleep each night, and in place of discussing politics or the latest revelations about the candidates, they were seen regularly smiling or laughing—not cynically, or as a defense mechanism, even, but out of genuine joy.” \\n“In my 30 years studying human cultures, I’ve never come across a people so happy,” she continued. \\nAccording to Letts, when tribe members were asked their thoughts on major-party candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, they looked puzzled for a moment and then shrugged their shoulders before grinning warmly and continuing on with their day. Similarly, villagers reportedly appeared confused but at ease when asked about the national mood, saying that as far as they could tell, people were feeling pretty good about everything. \\nThe anthropologists confirmed this sense of tranquility permeated all aspects of life in the tribe, observing that when extended families gathered for mealtimes, the tenor of their conversation remained pleasant and amicable, with no subjects deemed off-limits. Moreover, scientists noted that the village lacked any signage, clothing, or other paraphernalia bearing divisive words or imagery, and residents appeared to trust one another and appreciate time spent interacting. \\n“When I brought out my iPad to show them footage of the recent presidential debates, they immediately became agitated, and several of the children started to cry,” said graduate student Lester Reinhold, who explained that the perplexed villagers kept asking him why the people on the screen interrupted each other so often when they didn’t even have anything of value to say. “I explained that one of the two people onstage would be their next leader, and they all gasped and recoiled in horror, with many saying they didn’t see how that could possibly be true.” \\n“I then tried showing them an attack ad about Donald Trump’s comments and actions toward women, but many of them became terrified and began screaming—that’s when one of the village elders swatted the tablet out of my hand,” he added. “After seeing how upset it made them, I determined that it was in their best interest to keep all audio and video clips from the election cycle away from them for the rest of our onsite study.” \\nScientists noted that when they surveyed members of the tribe about their expectations for the future, specifically after November 8, the responses they received were universally optimistic. Every villager, regardless of age, gender, or social status within the community, reportedly mentioned how they anticipated things would continue to go as well as they had been going. \\nWhen asked to name the most pressing issue facing them, a few members of the group reportedly admitted, however, that it had been raining a lot lately, and that a little sunshine might be nice. \\n“This is a perfectly preserved community, probably the last of its kind anywhere,” said Letts, who expressed concern that outside forces such as the ever-lengthening campaign season and an increase of on-the-ground political operatives in the area threatened to encroach on the tribe’s simpler and more satisfying way of life. “Even though they’re disconnected from much of the modern-day world and the daily news cycle, these individuals seemed to possess something we don’t: a true sense of delight and positivity toward everyday existence, like each new day is a gift to be cherished.” \\n“Our society could learn a lot from these people,” she added. \\nAt press time, sources confirmed a campaign bus could be seen winding its way down a wooded road toward the village.

       "  'Nathan Wellman | November 17, 2016 \\nThe felony charges facing some of the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters who were arrested during last October’s raid have been dismissed by a local judge. \\nThe protesters – who prefer to be referred to as water protectors – clashed with police in riot gear who were under orders to clear them out of the way for the controversial pipeline. The water protectors refused, saying they owned the land according to the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 , which gave control of the land to various Native American tribes. (The treaty was quickly broken after its ratification, mostly by the U.S. government, but also by a few rogue tribe members.) \\nThe confrontation lasted for hours, with police deploying ear-damaging sound cannons against protesters, as well as pepper spray and rubber bullets. Protesters set a few contained fires and a few of them threw objects at police. \\nAfter the confrontation, 147 people were arrested, with 139 of them being charged with a felony count of conspiracy to endanger by fire or explosion and two misdemeanor counts. \\nFor the felony charge, prosecutors claimed that some form of informal agreement was made by the accused to set fires throughout the day, putting local state officials and the natural surroundings at risk. South Central District Judge Cynthia Feland noted that the affidavit against the protesters did not name who planned this crime, nor how and when the crime was committed, or even when this agreement was made. “As far as the court can tell from the facts alleged in the affidavit, these fires were set sporadically, at different locations, by different individuals, seemingly at random,” Feland said. “The state has not alleged facts sufficient to show an explicit or implicit agreement between the 139 defendants to commit the offense charged.” While the felony charge was thrown out, protesters continue to be charged with misdemeanor counts of engaging in a riot and maintaining a public nuisance. While the ruling is a victory for the Dakota water protecters, Feland did make a point to note that “the court recognizes the extreme stress under which law enforcement officers and the prosecutors bringing these charges have been operating. This order should not be considered a criticism of their efforts or a suggestion the arrest in this matter was not appropriate.” \\nNathan Wellman is a Los Angeles-based journalist, author, and playwright.

       "  \"Share on Twitter \\nAlyssa had known that having a baby wouldn't be easy. According to Fox News 5 , a variety of health problems — including cerebral palsy, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes — guaranteed that her pregnancy would qualify as a high risk one. \\nStill, she and her husband wanted nothing more than to be parents. Image Credit: Alyssa Young/Independent Journal Review \\nSo, when Alyssa learned she was pregnant, it was a joyous moment in what had been a very difficult year for their family. Immediately, Alyssa decided that if the baby was a girl, she would name her “Scarlett Faye” after the two most important women in her life — her mother and her recently deceased grandmother. Alyssa tells Independent Journal Review: \\n“The joy I felt was indescribable. I loved being pregnant. It's all I talked about, thought about, and dreamed about. From the moment I found out that there was life inside of me, I thought that this baby was a blessing sent to us all. She was going to shed light on this terrible year everyone had had.” \\nThe pregnancy progressed better than Alyssa could have hoped. She learned that her baby would be a girl, and that little Scarlett was growing as expected. Then, at 20 weeks, Alyssa started experiencing pain and minor bleeding. \\nAt first, her discomfort was dismissed as normal pregnancy aches. However, when the pain got worse, Alyssa headed to the hospital, praying all the way that everything would be fine. \\nOnce at the hospital, the on-call obstetrician told Alyssa that she had an incompetent cervix. While Alyssa was willing to undergo a procedure to address the issue, the doctor explained that it wouldn't help. The only hope lay in strict bed rest and medication that might stop her from dilating further. Alyssa tells Independent Journal Review: \\n“After the doctor left the room, Justin laid over the bed rail, grabbed my right hand, and just sobbed. I wrapped my left arm around him and kissed his head, and cried with him. ... We held each other and cried together for what seemed like forever. That night seemed very long. I tossed and turned, prayed and thought. I begged God for everything to be okay. She was our blessing and I couldn't stand think of losing her.” \\nSadly, the next day, Alyssa learned that the measures they had tried hadn't worked. Her baby was on its way. The grief she felt was mixed with the feeling that she had failed as a mother: \\n“I felt like I had failed. I felt like I failed him [her husband] and our daughter. All I could spit out was 'I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.' I must have repeated that a dozen times.” \\nScarlett Faye was born at 20 weeks gestation, weighing less than a pound. Image Credit: Alyssa Young/Independent Journal Review \\nAlyssa describes the beauty of her newborn daughter: \\n“She was perfection. She was very well developed, and the most perfect combination between her father and I. She holds a special place in our hearts. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of her. My little girl yesterday, my angel today, my daughter forever.” \\nAs the nurses gave Alyssa her daughter to hold for the first time, the new mom found that there was so much she wanted to tell her baby. She tells Independent Journal Review: \\n“I held Scarlett on my chest and cried into hers. I studied her face, so it'd forever be imprinted in my mind. I studied her body, her toes, her ribs. Everything. ... I told her that I was so sorry. I told her I loved her. I told her it was okay to let go. ... Everyone took their turns and held her. Everyone got to love her. That's all she ever experienced was love.” \\nAlyssa's memories of her daughter are illuminated by love. Image Credit: Alyssa Young/Independent Journal Review \\nShe explains to Independent Journal Review that though her daughter only lived for two hours, every moment of that time was filled with the love of family: \\n“She felt love. That is it. In the two hours that she was alive, she fought to stay with us. In those two hours, she was cuddled, kissed, hugged, and loved. She went peacefully. Justin and I got to be with her two whole days before we went home. I was able to cuddle her body, change her dirty diapers, bathe her, and love her.

       " [\"'This Is Us' Star Reveals How 'Heartbreaking' It Was to Join Weight Watchers When She Was Just 11\",\n",
       "  'Share on Twitter \\n36-year-old Chrissy Metz has finally gotten her breakout role as Kate Pearson, a woman who\\'s struggling with her weight, on the new hit show “This Is Us.” \\nThe show revolves around the lives of several couples whose lives intertwine in unexpected ways. Like her character, Metz has also struggled with her size ever since she was a little girl. \\nIn an interview with People Magazine this week, Metz revealed that she has felt the exact same pains that 8-year-old Kate experienced in the flashbacks sequences shown on TV. \\nFor Metz, even as a child her weight “was always something I was cognizant of. I’ve had pictures of when I was 3 and 4 years old, and I’ve always been chubby.” \\nThen she discovered that her weight was something she was supposed to be ashamed of. Image Credit: David Livingston/Getty Images \\nIn fact, she was enrolled in Weight Watchers at just 11 years old: \\n“I remember being at Weight Watchers at, like, 11 years old and my mom just trying to figure it out for me. \\nIt’s one of those things where it’s heartbreaking because, as a parent, you want your child to have the best life possible and you want them to be protected and in this little bubble where everybody finds them to be beautiful and perfect and their lives to be amazing. \\nBut that’s not always the case.” \\nWhen she was young she would starve herself, but then as soon as she had the opportunity she would binge on unhealthy food. \\nThe resulting weight gain perplexed her parents, because she hid her binges from them: \\n“I would not eat, and then, of course, I would get so hungry I would binge...and it was difficult because my parents were like, ‘I don’t understand, if you’re not really eating, why are you gaining weight?’ I would be at one of my good friend’s house and her mom would literally make us a tray of brownies and split it down the middle, and we would go to town.” Image Credit: David Livingston/Getty Images \\nAt 30, Metz realized that she doesn\\'t have to stress and worry about what others think about her body. She called that a life-changing moment: \\n“I had this epiphany that my life is my own and my choices are my own.” \\nPrior to “This Is Us,” Metz appeared in only a few things , and certainly not as a lead actress. \\nShe played Ima \\'Barbara\\' Wiggles on “American Horror Story: Freak Show,” described as the “fattest woman of all time” by the show. \\nEven then, she had to wear a fat suit on set: \\nHer newfound fame and honest portrayal of a woman struggling with her weight has not gone to her head, though. She\\'s staying grounded and grateful: \\n“I just feel really grateful that I can pursue my dreams and also reach people in ways that I never expected.” \\nMetz told Refinery 29 last month that women have already reached out to her and praised her touching portrayal of Kate. \\nIn reality, 67% of American women are a size 14 or higher, but these women only make up about 2% of the images portrayed in the media, according to Refinery 29 . \\nResearch has also shown that dieting is more likely to cause obesity than solve it, according to the New York Times : \\n\"After about five years, 41 percent of dieters gain back more weight than they lost. Long-term studies show dieters are more likely than non-dieters to become obese over the next one to 15 years. \\nThat’s true in men and women, across ethnic groups, from childhood through middle age. The effect is strongest in those who started in the normal weight range, a group that includes almost half of the female dieters in the United States.\" \\nWhile she\\'s not the first, Metz\\'s performance has the potential to open more doors for plus-sized actresses who are trying to find their place in Hollywood. Other actresses such as Rebel Wilson, Queen Latifah, and Melissa McCarthy have also helped pave the way. '],\n",
       " [\"11 Stupid Things Vox.com's Matthew Yglesias Has Said | Daily Wire\",\n",
       "  '11 Stupid Things Vox.com\\'s Matthew Yglesias Has Said By: Aaron Bandler October 26, 2016 \\nMatt Yglesias of Vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder, given his penchant for saying things that are mind-bogglingly asinine. Apparently Yglesias agrees with this sentiment: Matt Yglesias deleted something like 30,000 tweets yesterday. Clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations. \\nFortunately, the Internet is forever and all of the stupid things that Yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly. \\nHere are 11 things Yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb. \\n1. Yglesias was convinced that people would love Obamacare. That is, until he didn\\'t: . @mattyglesias Obamacare marker - which was solid as of 15 minutes ago - appears to no longer be markering pic.twitter.com/a0EyXImI8g — Omri Ceren (@cerenomri) October 26, 2016 \\nHis 2013 piece is still available though, and in it he whines about how supposedly \"the media, for non-ideological reasons, is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing.\" Yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that \"when Obamacare becomes the status quo, people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten.\" \\nIn other words, Yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking. That all fell by the wayside when the Obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of 25 percent. \\n2. Yglesias made a racist comment toward former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R). In a 2013 tweet that is now deleted, Yglesias wrote, \"Is Bobby Jindal’s reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping?\" \\nYglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash, tweeting: \"Oh, fun. Conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode.\" \\nEventually, Yglesias backed down, tweeting: \"For the record, now that I know more about Jindal’s life it’s clear that he’s a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff.\" \\nThe irony of Yglesias saying this was not lost on Twitter: Good thing you don\\'t say dumb stuff. MT @mattyglesias It’s clear that Jindal’s a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff. — jon gabriel (@exjon) June 18, 2013 \\n3. Yglesias once ranted against \"dumb Jewish politicians.\" The leftist pundit wrote a ThinkProgress piece in 2009 that was seriously titled \"Dumb Jewish Politicians,\" in which Yglesias highlighted a passage from Jonathan Chait, who wrote in the New Republic that then-Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) had to be stupid for not supporting the public option. \\n\"I suspect that Lieberman is the beneficiary, or possibly the victim, of a cultural stereotype that Jews are smart and good with numbers,\" Chait wrote. \"Trust me, it’s not true. If Senator Smith from Idaho was angering Democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes, most liberals would deride him as an idiot. With Lieberman, we all suspect it’s part of a plan. I think he just has no idea what he’s talking about and doesn’t care to learn\" \\nYglesias agreed: \\nI’ve long held a related theory about Eric Cantor. \\nAnyways, this reminds me that at a meeting this morning I pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret Christmas morning session that only Jewish Senators would attend. There’s a whole bunch\\u200a—\\u200aBoxer, Cardin, Feingold, Feinstein, Franken, Kohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Sanders, Schumer, Specter, and Wyden. It’s a very progressive bunch and Lieberman could easily be outvoted \\n4. Yglesias advocated for ending time zones. Seriously. In what was a typical example of Vox being a waste of space, Yglesias wrote a 2014 piece titled \"The case against time zones: They\\'re impractical & outdated.\" Yglesias pontificated: \\nNorthern Idaho is connected via I-90 to Spokane and Seattle to its west, but not to Boise to its south so the Couer d\\'Alene area is on Pacific Time rather than Mountain Time. India has broken with the general scheme and adopted a half-hour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time. \\nYet while these zig-zags and 30-minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time, they serve a very practical purpose. It is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings, calls, and other arrangements across time zones. The need to constantly specify which time zone you\\'re talking about is a drag. Commuting across time zones would be more annoying still, which is why the suburbs of Chicago that are located in Indiana use Illinois\\' Central Time rather than Indianapolis\\' Eastern Time. \\nBut the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations. It\\'s to shift the world to one giant time zone. \\nYgleasias then called for \"One time to rule them all\"–a phrase that prompted J.R.R. Tolkien to weep in his grave–and then wrote this doozy: \\nIf the whole world used a single GMT-based time, schedules would still vary. In general most people would sleep when it\\'s dark out and work when it\\'s light out. So at 23:00, most of London would be at home or in bed and most of Los Angeles would be at the office. But of course London\\'s bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in LA would be grabbing a nap. The difference from today is that if you were putting together a London-LA conference call at 21:00 there\\'d be only one possible interpretation of the proposal. A flight that leaves New York at 14:00 and lands in Paris at 20:00 is a six-hour flight, with no need to keep track of time zones. If your appointment is in El Paso at 11:30 you don\\'t need to remember that it\\'s in a different time zone than the rest of Texas. \\nPejman Yousefzadeh explained just how stupid Yglesias\\'s time zone piece was, writing at Ricochet : \"I grant you that there are times when confusion does take place, but seriously, who cares? Is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that Matthew Yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them? Don’t the people at Vox have anything better to write about?\" \\nApparently they don\\'t. \\n5. Yglesias doesn\\'t understand Florida\\'s geography very well. Yglesias wrote a short blurb in The Atlantic in 2007, in which he began thinking aloud about the city of Miami. \\n\"I\\'d been interested to know what, if anything, is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know,\" Yglesias said. \\nPeople immediately pointed the obvious answer: Miami couldn\\'t do so because there was this thing called a swamp–most of which is The Everglades National Park–causing such development to be difficult to accomplish. \\n\"Yes, yes, commenters I know it\\'s a freaking swamp but there\\'s plenty of development on ex-swampland in Florida -- hence all the canals and weird-looking lakes,\" an exasperated Yglesias wrote in an update. \\nExcept that the land is not \"ex-swampland,\" it\\'s an actual swamp . Maybe Yglesias shouldn\\'t write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud. \\n6. Yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fine...if you\\'re a politician. Yglesias found himself getting smacked around on Twitter after he advocated for high-speed rail advocates to provide an \"unrealistically optimistic\" projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government. \\n\"For better or for worse, that’s politics,\" Yglesias wrote at ThinkProgress . \\nOn Twitter, Yglesias attempted to justify it by writing: \"Fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do, yes.\" \\nAnd yet, Yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist Eli Lake of being dishonest on Twitter. \\nYglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a Catch-22 when he told the Daily Caller to \"go f*** yourself\" when they tried to interview him about the Twitter incident. \\n7. Yglesias once hailed the Department of Veteran Affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate. The Federalist \\'s Sean Davis pointed to Yglesias writing in 2009 that the VA was \"producing the highest quality care in the country. Their turnaround points the way toward solving America’s health-care crisis.\" Yglesias also tweeted at GOP chairman Reince Priebus in 2013, \"Will @Reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans?\" This tweet was also deleted, and for good reason, since the VA has caused 307,000 veteran deaths due to \"systemic\" problems with the agency. \\n8. Yglesias doesn\\'t understand the purpose of the Senate. Yglesias wrote the following for ThinkProgress in 2009, per the Guardian : \\nIf you add together the two Republican Senators from Wyoming with the one from Alaska, one from South Dakota, one from New Hampshire, two from Maine, two from Idaho, two from Nebraska, one from Nevada, two from Utah, two from Kansas, two from Mississippi, one from Iowa, two from Oklahoma, two from Kentucky, one from Louisiana, two from South Carolina, and two from Alabama, the 28 of them collectively represent (on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator) 11.98 percent of the American population. Meanwhile, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein together represent 11.95 percent of the American population. \\nNow of course Texas is also a big state (though at 7.81 percent of the population it\\'s a lot smaller than California) and there are small states (like Vermont and North Dakota) that have two Democratic Senators. So the point here isn\\'t a narrowly partisan one, though the wacky apportionment of the Senate does have a partisan valence. The point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things. If you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population, we have just 34 Senators representing the above-average states even though they collectively contain 69.15 percent of the population. The other 66 Senators represent about 30 percent of the people. If the Iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution, nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them. \\nIn three paragraphs of rambling, incoherent nonsense, Yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations. \\n9. Yglesias doesn\\'t understand America\\'s financial system. Yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a 2013 Slate column that there were \"far far far too many banks\" in the country, as there were 6,891 at the time. Yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous: \\n1. They are poorly managed: You know how the best and brightest of Wall Street royally screw up sometimes? This doesn\\'t get better when you drill down to the less-bright and not-as-good guys. It gets worse. And since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from FDIC-ensured depositors, nobody is watching the store. In effect, the well-managed banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones. The dubious decision-making doesn\\'t get as complicated as what you see on Wall Street—it\\'s mostly just classic boom-and-bust pro-cyclical commercial real estate loans—but it creates all the same problems. 2. They can\\'t be regulated: Since these banks are so small, they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs. So since American public policy is perversely committed to preserving them, small banks regularly get various kinds of carve-outs from regulations. And once the carve-outs exist, they create pressure for extension further up the food chain. Other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation. 3. They can\\'t compete: If you want the JPMorgan Chases and Bank of Americas of the world to be held to account, you need both regulation and competition. But a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesn\\'t offer any real competition. Having a large share of America\\'s banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize big-time finance. \\nDavis debunked Yglesias\\'s argument, which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there haven\\'t been any new banks formed in recent years (there were at least four in 2013.) \\n\"Yglesias\\' arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anti-community bank talking points promoted by the big banks (\\'You guys, the Wall Street banks that nearly destroyed America aren’t the problem. Small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem. Don’t worry about the facts. Just go with it.\\'),\" Davis wrote in The Federalist . \"I\\'m actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation.\" \\n10. Yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon. After reading a review of a Booker T. Washington biography, Yglesias started thinking about \"\\'black conservative\\' political tradition,\" prompting him to write in a 2009 ThinkProgress post, \"It\\'s only extremely recently that the idea of an African-American aligning himself, à la Clarence Thomas, with the mainstream conservative movement in America could be remotely possible. But even so, that didn’t mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didn’t exist.\" \\nThis is patently false, as Damon Root explained in Reason : \\nActually, the great Harlem Renaissance author and journalist George Schuyler—who was known as the “black H.L. Mencken”—published “general rightist sentiments” long before Clarence Thomas came on the scene, including Schuyler’s unambiguously titled 1966 autobiography Black and Conservative. And the celebrated novelist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston both endorsed conservative Sen. Robert A. Taft in the 1952 presidential election and repeatedly attacked FDR’s New Deal... \\n11. Yglesias expressed joy when Andrew Breitbart died. Following Breitbart\\'s death, Yglesias tweeted : \"Conventions around dead people are ridiculous. The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart [sic] dead.\" \\nThis tweet has also been deleted, and for good reason–celebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid, it\\'s ghoulish, vile and reprehensible. And Slate defended Yglesias, stating that he \"is a very passionate journalist and Slate values that passion.\" \\nApparently Slate believes that \"passion\" trumps basic human decency and a reasonable IQ level, and Yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities.

They have four children together and run an entire Magnolia empire together, so needless to say their time apart is few and far between. \\nAs Joanna writes on her blog “Magnolia Market,” they don\\'t really want to be apart. Image Credit: Donna Ward/Getty Images \\nIn fact, she says that early on in their marriage they learned that they work better when they are together than when they are apart: \\n“One pretty amazing thing we learned early on was that the more time we spent together, the better our relationship was. We seem to give each other energy. We function better together than we do apart, and I don\\'t think either one of us has ever felt the urge to say, \\'I need a break from you.\\'” \\nAnd although the inspirational couple admits they have their little squabbles every now and then, they never find themselves in full-blown arguments... anymore, that is. A photo posted by Joanna Stevens Gaines (@joannagaines) on Aug 19, 2016 at 7:07pm PDT \\nDuring an interview with YouTube\\'s Jefferson Bethke , Chip described a fight they had as newlyweds that Joanna says ended all other fights: \\n“I remember when we were first newly weds, we had just bought our first little flip property and we were working at this thing till like two o\\'clock every morning for weeks at a time. When it got to basically the end of this sleepless endeavor that we were on, Jo and I got into some argument about something completely irrelevant.” \\nAt this point in the story, Jo chimed in saying that the fight started because of something Chip said, but never explained exactly what her husband said some 12 years ago. A photo posted by Chip Gaines (@chippergaines) on Oct 19, 2016 at 3:09pm PDT \\nThat\\'s when Chip continued by saying: \\n\"Jo slammed this gallon of primer down on the floor and the primer bounced back up and literally hit her on the face, as if she\\'s been egged in the face, so this primer is just falling of off her eye lashes, falling off of her nose and mouth. \\nIn my family, you know we are just average middle class American folks, when we would get into these knock-down-drag-out fights and something hilarious happens, we would all be like, \\'Timeout, you got primer on your face. That\\'s hilarious.\\' You know, it\\'s God\\'s way of telling everybody to calm down, you\\'re going to make it.\" \\nIn Jo\\'s family, however, having something like that happen during a fight changes the nature of the fight from simple argument to “ninja warfare.” \\n\"She started doing these roundabout high kicks toward my face and head. I remember, it was almost like a Matrix moment, where in slow motion, she is wheel-housing toward my face and for no reason I was doing these complete lateral bends that I didn\\'t even know I was capable of. \\nBut in that same moment I was like, \\'I love this woman, I think this is going to work.\\'\" \\nAs Joanna made sure to point out, that was the first and only fight of that intensity they have had as a married couple, and Chip agrees with Joanna that they got all of their fighting out in that one night. \\nHowever, there was one other time that Chip says Joanna pulled a knife out on him, but Jo didn\\'t want that story told. \\nIf they can get past all of Chip\\'s bad jokes, then this adorable, creative couple can get through anything.

       " ['‘Plan-B’ — Obama Paves Way to Give Syrian ‘Moderate Rebels’ Anti-Aircraft Weapons to Fight Russia',\n",
       "  'By Claire Bernish at thefreethoughtproject.com\\nPresident Obama contemplated arming the already controversial ‘moderate’ Syrian rebels weapons to “defend themselves against Russian aircraft and artillery” as his Plan B for Syria when all else failed in the effort to oust Assad — but although this treacherous plan has been effectively shelved, it remains an option for whomever next ascends to the White House.\\nAccording to a new report from the Washington Post , Obama’s Plan B has neither been “approved or rejected” in the U.S.’ disintegrating and increasingly complex campaign to depose Syrian President Bashar al Assad — which has, of course, precipitated a perilous proxy war with staunch Syrian ally, Russia.\\nSkepticism over allowing the CIA to provide various anti-Assad terrorists — euphemistically termed moderate rebels by the U.S. — with “truck-mounted antiaircraft weapons that could help rebel units but would be difficult for a terrorist group to conceal and use against civilian aircraft” apparently forced the plan to be tabled, the Post reports.\\nIn the U.S. program to topple Assad, the CIA has armed and trained defectors from Syrian military known as the Free Syrian Army — whose own defectors went on to form the Islamic State — as well as other terroristic groups virtually indistinguishable from one another except for their political ideologies.\\nThese issues factored into restrictions on weapons the U.S. would provide to their sponsored rebels; but, as the Post explains:\\n“Rebels chafed at the restriction, complaining that it left them vulnerable to air attack by Assad and, more recently, Russia.”\\nPlan B was envisaged as a compromise by the CIA.\\nBut the complex state of affairs in Syria has led not only the FSA, but other ‘moderates,’ to ‘radicalize’ — complicating U.S.’ goals and frustrating Russian efforts to purge the embattled nation of terrorists. While the Pentagon’s public goal has duly sought to wrest control from Assad and fight the Islamic State, the CIA program of arming rebels is widely considered counterproductive — if not, perhaps, nefarious.\\nPlan B, despite potentially devastating repercussions, retains stolid support from top officials, including unsurprisingly CIA Director John Brennan and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter — but has lost favor recently with former proponents, including Secretary of State John Kerry.\\nKerry and other skeptics rightly grasp providing heavy artillery to rebels fighting Russia-backed Syrian government forces to down Russian aircraft — which would undoubtedly turn the smoldering U.S. proxy battle into an all-out war with Russia.\\nAdditionally, the Post reports, a growing number of U.S. officials feel the contentious CIA program has only proven to bedevil the ultimate goal of regime change, and, as one unnamed ‘senior official’ noted, CIA units are “not doing any better on the battlefield, they’re up against a more formidable adversary, and they’re increasingly dominated by extremists,” adding, “What has this program become, and how will history record this effort?”'],\n",

       " ['Julian Assange Makes VERY Suspect Post Election Announcement, Seeks Pardon From Trump',\n",
       "  '0 122 \\nWikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange’s lawyers have suggested that the globally detested, thorn in the side social figure will keep at, and even perhaps intensify, efforts to be fully pardoned by the United States once President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year. \\nAssange’s lawyers made the announcement after the controversial global “whistleblower” spoke with Swedish authorities who had come to consult with him within the neutral territory of the Ecuadorian embassy in the U.K. over rape charges which Assange faces in Sweden. \\nAssange has been holed up in the aforementioned embassy for years in an effort to escape facing the diverse set of global charges which have been lobbed against him. \\nAnd, as for a pivoted effort for Assange to escape the charges he faces, one directed at attempting to garner a Trump signed, U.S. presidential pardon, Assange’s lawyers said, according to London’s Evening Standard , “Through U.S. counsel, we had reached out to the Obama administration, most recently just a few months ago, and we will continue to do so with future U.S. administrations until the investigation is closed.” \\nThese efforts at a presidential pardon for Assange began, as noted, under the Obama administration, but with Obama’s own federal appointments and the soon to be former president himself as the ones to ever begin an investigation into Assange in the first place, efforts for an Obama pardon of Assange unsurprisingly never got anywhere. \\nThe U.S. investigation was first prompted by Assange’s publication of classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan delivered to him by Army whistleblower Bradley/Chelsea Manning — who, mind you, is still in American custody and doesn’t seem to have much of a hope of release anytime soon. \\nAssange’s more recent work, during the lead up to Election Day, quickly turned into an elaborate anti-Clinton campaign, one viewed by American intelligence officials as backed by the Russian government in the interest of seeing their preferred candidate — Trump — elected to the presidency. \\nWikiLeaks published in this time frame a huge cache of emails hacked from key members of the Democratic Party leadership and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, targeting figures from the now former party chairperson and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. WikiLeaks also released many thousands of emails taken from Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state serving under President Obama. \\nThe credibility of the emails has been occasionally questioned. Indeed, even if the organization only received and hacked actual emails and the like that had actually come from Democratic Party officials. WikiLeaks was still found, on multiple occasions, to have been improperly spinning the email contents. Such as the time a mundane email about then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s UN translation providing earpiece, was spun into a fake story about Clinton using an earpiece to be fed what she was supposed to say. \\nTrump is far from predictable enough for any observer to definitively suggest his course of action regarding Assange once he takes office.

       "  'Tuesday 1 November 2016 by James W School to trial cage fighting \\nAs the Government drops its plans to turn all UK schools into academies, Lonchester High School in Hull pledges to continue offering a curriculum that is relevant to the world beyond the school gates. \\n“This year we are trialling ultimate style cage fighting for our year 7s,” says head teacher Adam Smarts. \\nWith a reputation for his progressive approach, Smarts views the move as a necessary change to outdated school sports with questionable role models. \\n“Cage fighting is current, the kids no longer have posters on their walls of football players or pop stars; nowadays it’s all about mixed martial arts.” \\nAt a recent parents evening, Smarts introduced the idea as part of a suite of new initiatives to better prepare the kids for their lives ahead. \\n“Mr Smarts is right,” says Kevin Chalmers, father of 11-year old Toby who begins Year 7 in the autumn. \\n“It’s a mucked-up world out there and we need to toughen them up…I don’t want my son prancing around outside when he can be locked in an enclosed space fighting for his life…for me it’s a no brainer.” \\nOther parents at the school agree and have wholeheartedly backed Smarts and his team. \\n“Within a week, we’d had 96% of permission slips back and orders for kid-sized fighting gloves. \\n“Of course safety is important, so our cages have been ratified by the Ultimate Fighting Championship and we always ensure that blood spillage is cleaned up thoroughly between bouts.” \\nBullying has been virtually eradicated at the school courtesy of the inaugural teachers versus pupils fight-night. \\n“The usual troublemakers are either traumatised or incapacitated, so the playground is a much friendlier place.” \\nSmarts concedes that his ideas are not to everyone’s tastes but insists the results speak for themselves. \\n“We’ve even saved some money by selling the now redundant sports field for much-needed housing and the occasional death in the arena has helped to keep class sizes manageable.” \\nSmarts hand-picked team are fully invested in the approach and are keen to quash any residual parental scepticism. \\n“Come sports day, if anyone still has questions, we’ll get them in the cage, have a good scrap and I’m sure they’ll soon see the benefit…it’ll certainly make a fun change to the usual egg and spoon race,” says head of tactics and geography, Julian Titlow. \\nSpring term will see Lonchester broadening its extra-curricular options further to include dog fighting and an after school club version of The Hunger Games, with plans to combine the two as an end of year treat for leavers.

       "  ' Syria - Waiting For The Next Moves By Moon Of Alabama\\nNovember 09, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" Moon Of Alabama \" - We had expected a Syrian Army \"Election Campaign\" , a large size attack on Al Bab or east-Aleppo. That did not happen despite the right \"assets\" being in place and I have heard no reason yet why it was delayed. The Russian aircraft carrier group, which was expected last Friday along the Syrian coast, will only arrive this evening. It must have intentionally slowed its travel. There has been no single Syrian or Russian airstrike on east-Aleppo in last 21 days. \"Rebel\" shelling of west-Aleppo has not stopped for a day and caused many casualties. That will now change. One Russia source claims the Russian fleet will engage immediately. NOTAMs, NOtices To Air Men, about imminent operations on Syria\\'s west-coast have been released. The declared areas and times of operation correspond to a campaign, not a single strike.\\nAfter some 12 days of fighting, the second large al-Qaeda campaign to break the siege on east-Aleppo by attacking the south western side of west-Aleppo completely failed. While the first round nearly achieved a break through but was then contained the second attack was only a alibi attempt which never made any progress towards its claimed aim. The Syrian army has recaptured the housing project 1070 and will soon have cleaned all other areas that were shortly in the hands of the Jihadis. The loss in material and men for the Jihadis were immense. The Syrian army has finally learned how to defend against suicide vehicle bombs: have adequate weapons ready in the front line to kill them on their approaches. Of nearly 20 such bomb runs only 3 or 4 reached their targets and losses from those were less sever than from earlier bombs. The Jihadis and their \"western\" media and \"expert\" proxies seem to have given up on east-Aleppo. There is no sign that another break through attempt will be launched.\\nThe Obama administration has announced a campaign to encircle Raqqa in center-east Syria. It bought help from the Kurdish YPG to achieve that and has thereby excluded a Turkish campaign. The taking of Raqqa is supposed to be left to some Arab troops in cooperation with the Kurds. But those Arab troops do not yet exist and hiring and training has not even begun. The whole announcement of the beginning of a Raqqa campaign was obviously not serious. The Kurds will take a few small towns and the U.S. will temporarily protect them from sever Turkish interference in their areas in Syria. Raqqa will not be attacked before next years spring.\\nThe Turks are now miffed (though silently relieved) that they were not asked to take part in the Raqqa campaign. They have been promised that they may help to \"develop a long-term plan for seizing, holding and governing Raqqa\". That means exactly nothing. But the Turks never had a real chance to go and take Raqqa. It is too far from their borders and the imponderables are too big.\\nIn the area around Damascus the Ghouta rebel hold out has been split and reduced to small kettles which will be eliminated within a few days. The Syrian capital is safe for now and its people can live a rather normal life without fear of being killed in the next minute by some random grenade. A significant number of troops will become available when all the small rebel areas around the capital are gone. Those can be used in future campaigns. The frontline strength of the Syrian army in critical areas will increase and its maneuver force will become more powerful and efficient.\\nThe momentum in all of west Syria is on the side of the Syrian government. The Jihadists are more and more concentrated in Idleb governate and city. When the surrounded hold outs in its back are eliminated the Syrian army can launch an assault on them. The east is complicate. Deir Ezzor is still surrounded by ISIS and will likely be attacked again soon. Reinforcements for the defenders would be welcome.\\nThe Kurds are playing games and change alliances every now and than. For the time they again bet on the U.S. - a hope that has already been disappointed several times. The U.S. will let them fall as soon as it is convenient. The Kurds will learn again that such a policy does not bear tasteful fruits. There is a common Turkish and Syrian interest in cutting them back to size. In a year from now we may see new surprise alliances in that area.\\nAll the positive developments we have seen especially in west-Syria may be for naught if a new U.S. president decides to throw up the chess board and risk World War III by attacking Syrian and Russian positions. Its about the most stupid thing Washington could do and has thereby a good chance to happen. I hope that the Pentagon will lecture the politicians of the very real consequences such a move would have.\\nRussian Navy will hit ISIS targets in Aleppo with cruise missiles : The Russian source insisted the missiles will aim for areas surrounding Aleppo to avoid harming the 200,000 civilians still living there.'],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nST. PETERSBURG, November 8. /TASS/. Russian researchers plan to resume drilling works at the world’s deepest well of about four kilometers which leads to Lake Vostok, the biggest subglacial lake in Antarctica, chief of the Russian Antarctic expedition Valery Lukin told TASS on Monday. \\n“We plan to resume drilling works at Lake Vostok, despite the fact that funding of the entire program of the expedition has remained at the last year’s level, or slightly more than one billion rubles ($15.67 million),” he said, adding that last year saw a break in the works at Lake Vostok as the most money consuming in the entire expedition’s program. \\nAccording to Lukin, the plan for this Antarctic summer season is to expand the well’s lower section to prevent water rise in the well during the next, third, drilling attempt to reach the lake’s water, like it happened during the first two attempts. \\nIt is not yet decided whether the third attempt to reach the lake’s water will be made this year. “Most likely, we will not have enough time for that during this season but still there is a chance for that,” he said. \\nResearchers plan to arrive at the Vostok station located near the subglacial lake on December 6 and finish their mission in early February. \\nThis year, the Russian Antarctic expedition will use three ships to get to the destination. Thus, the Akademik Fedorov is scheduled to sail off on November 12, the Akademik Tereshnikov — on November 19, and the Akademik Karpinsky — in late November. The seasonal expedition, according to Lukin, will include 120 specialists. As many as 110 polar explorers will spend the next winter at five round-the-year Antarctic stations. \\nLake Vostok, measuring 250 by 50 kilometers, was discovered by the 33rd Russian Antarctic Expedition in 1987. It lies beneath some four kilometers of ice. Drilling was launched in 1989. In February 2012, researchers reached the watershed and took the first samples of water, which were found to contain traces of living organisms, hitherto unknown cold-resistant bacteria. However there was no 100% guarantee that these bacteria had originated from the subglacial lake, since water samples were polluted with priming water from the well. Months later, however, the water in the lake rose and froze at the level of 363 meters. The explorers had to drill a new well parallel to the old one from the depth of 3,406 meters. \\n{{item.group_date}} '],\n",

       "  'Doctors prescribe deadly opioid for pain-related issues that aren’t even legal share in: Big Pharma , FDA , Harmful medicine , Health , medical marijuana , Pharmaceutical Drug Addiction \\nCorruption. Bribery. Death. All three are examined in various news reports on a little known “specialty pharmaceutical company” called Insys Theraputics. They are currently under legal fire for Subsys, a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl, a very fast acting opioid that is “80 times more potent than morphine.” The under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that Subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from “sudden spikes of excruciating pain.” \\nSarah Fuller was a 32 year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia . She didn’t have cancer. But that didn’t stop her doctor from prescribing Subsys for her aches and pains. The fentanyl acted quickly with Sarah’s already prescribed Xanax, a benzodiazepine. She died. Her family is suing the manufacturer. But why did Sarah’s doctor prescribe a drug that wasn’t approved? That’s easy to answer. Just follow the money. \\nAs Stat reports, the sales of Subsys grew to $331 million precisely because physicians give it to patients that don’t have cancer, like Sarah Fuller. Doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner, or lunch. Over $6 million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity. \\nTake the example of nurse practitioner Heather Alfonso from Illinois. She was paid $83,000 to “go to dinner with a few people,” and in response, prescribed $1.6 million dollars of Subsys scripts to patients that weren’t suffering with cancer pain. She didn’t contest the allegations against her. \\nGetting paid to speak isn’t automatically a bribe, but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to Susbys marketing methods. Alabama prosecutors built a case against Nancy Reed Perhacs, who used to be a sales representative for Insys Theraputics. Ms. Perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend, provided he prescribed Subsys. Her take was $700,000. Other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in Kansas, Rhode Island, New York, Oregon, Michigan, Florida and New Hampshire. \\nThe chief executive, founder and chairman of Insys Theraputics is billionaire John Kapoor. He’s been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups. Kapoor thinks doctors are “all ethical.” His new FDA approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) called Syndros. As states legalize the real medicine in cannabis , THC and CBD oil , this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott. \\nSources: '],\n",

Anthony Weiner, Abedin’s estranged husband. \\nComey, however, said in his letter to Congress that he was only ‘briefed yesterday,’ meaning WND readers knew of the potential security breach two months before the director did. \\nAs WND reported Sept. 8 , Clinton forwarded an Aug. 8, 2009, email – clearly marked “Classified” – to a personal, nonsecure email address registered to aide Abedin, huma@clintonemail.com. Abedin then forwarded the message to another personal, nonsecure account, humamabedin@yahoo.com. \\nIn sworn testimony before Congress, however, Clinton declared, “There was nothing marked classified on my emails, either sent or received.” \\nThe 2009 email, sent to Clinton from longtime adviser Sidney Blumenthal, was discovered in a cache of emails obtained by Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The exchange concerned the “disastrous nature” of an Obama trip to Germany, charging the U.S. was “totally out of the loop in Berlin – no ambassador,” resulting in the expectation that “Germans and Russians will now cut their own separate deals on energy, regional security, etc.” \\nWND also reported two-thirds of Abedin’s released emails were forwarded to personal addresses she controlled and Clinton’s State Department chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, may have received classified information through personal email accounts . \\nIn WND’s report of the marked classified email, Greg Davis, a U.S. Army veteran with more than 30 years experience as a military intelligence officer, told WND the handling of the message is “an obvious violation of national security regulations regarding the handling of classified information for which people normally go to prison.” \\nDavis, the creator of the intelligence-oriented website SpookdBlog.com, said that typically the Justice Department would grant Abedin immunity from prosecution in return for her willingness to turn state’s evidence against Clinton. \\n“If Huma refused to cooperate, the Department of Justice could threaten to seek a maximum prison term for her should their effort to bring a criminal prosecution against her succeed,” he said at the time. \\nThe email containing marked classified information previously was released by the State Department, but it was unknown until the Judicial Watch released that Clinton forwarded the exchange to Abedin’s nonsecure, personal Yahoo account. \\nSee the classified email: \\nH/T – WND \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.

       "  'November 22, 2016 \\nIndigenous water protectors at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site just got assistance from military veterans. \\nBetween December 4 and December 7, veterans of various branches of the United States armed forces have scheduled a “deployment” to show solidarity and lend support to the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. The event, called “ Veterans Stand for Standing Rock ,” already has 108 confirmed RSVPs on Facebook, and features several high-profile progressive activists who have served in the military, including U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Baltimore police officer-turned police brutality whistleblower Michael A. Wood, Jr . \\n“Bring Body armor, gas masks, earplugs AND shooting mufflers (we may be facing a sound cannon) but no drugs, alcohol or weapons,” the event page, organized by Wes Clark Jr., states. \\nThe Facebook event is already being used to organize logistics for the veterans to come to Standing Rock, complete with rideshare registration and financial assistance for veterans scattered around the country who want to support the protest. \\n“My husband is a veteran Army Combat Medic,” wrote Morgan McClure on the event page. “He has been talking about doing this for so long.” \\nClark has also launched a GoFundMe page for the deployment, which he says will be used to provide material and logistical support to all the veterans wanting to join the Standing Rock protest from around the country. As of this writing, approximately $30,000 has been raised toward the $100,000 goal in just 10 days. \\n“Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors,” Clark wrote on the GoFundMe page. “Let’s stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. If not us, who? If not now, when?” \\nClark cited the need for veterans to support the indigenous protesters at the pipeline construction site due to the excessive and heavy-handed militarized police response to the protests. \\nHere are some of what the protesters at Standing Rock have faced: Mace, sound cannons. sniper guns pointed at unarmed civilians, journalists being shot with rubber bullets, journalists being arrested for covering the protests, attack dogs unleashed on groups including children, elder Natives getting tased and violently arrest[ sic ], protesters marked with numbers and kept in dog kennels after arrest… \\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline, which would transport roughly half a million barrels of crude oil daily underneath the Missouri River, has had construction held up for months as protests continue to grow. Indigenous communities gathering at the construction site say the pipeline has the potential to permanently poison water supplies for millions of people who depend on the Missouri River for drinking, bathing, and farming. Part of the Dakota Access Pipeline construction route have been held up by the Obama administration, though that order has been ignored by pipeline builders. \\n“Most civilians who’ve never served in a uniform are gutless worms who’ve never been in a fight in their life,” Clark told Task & Purpose . “So if we don’t stop it, who will?” \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

       "  'Pinterest \\nOregon militia leaders Ammon and Ryan Bundy, along with several others, were acquitted on Thursday in relation to their 41-day standoff at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon earlier this year, CNN has reported . Shaun King wrote in the New York Daily News that the acquittal was an example of “white privilege.” \\nLiberal race-baiters have jumped to the fore in the wake of the acquittal to make such claims without any understanding of the case. \\nAccording to King, if these had been Black Lives Matter activists, they wouldn’t have been acquitted. Neither would Muslim-American activists in King’s racist world. \\nKing claimed that BLM protesters would be treated very differently: \\nImagine just for a moment that heavily-armed Black Lives Matter activists took over a federal building. It’s doubtful that such a siege would last longer than a day. By and large, unarmed, non-violent peaceful black protestors are arrested on sight when they even block the entrance to a federal building. Many are still facing charges for such simple acts of civil disobedience to this very day and they did nothing like what the Bundy clan did in Oregon. \\nSet aside the fact that King has no clue about what the Bundys did and why they did it — if he did he would understand why his comparison doesn’t hold water — he also doesn’t realize that we don’t have to imagine much here in relation to BLM activists. \\nWere BLM protesters “non-violent” when they blocked major highways? How about when they beat an innocent white man? What about the rampant looting of innocent store owners in the wake of officer involved shootings? Then there are the police officers whose lives have been ruined, despite the fact that the shootings were found to have been justified, because race-baiters jumped to conclusions and incited violence to further their agenda. \\nWe see an enormous amount of lawlessness committed in the wake of officer-involved shootings that has nothing to do with the “cause”— which is roundly debunked by the facts — but people like King still defend it. \\nWhen a black man is killed by police, the police are condemned before the facts are in and even after it’s shown that a particular shooting was justified. \\nI wonder if King and other race-baiters cared as much when Oregon militia leader LaVoy Finicum was killed in an officer-involved shooting. That’s not to say whether it was justified or not, but that never stops the racial grievance mongers from protesting and rioting, does it? What’s the only difference there? Oh, Finicum was white. \\nHere’s what King had so say about how Muslim activists would be treated: \\nOr imagine that an armed group of Muslim-American activists took over a federal building. I’m not talking about immigrants or people on the terrorist watch list, but just good, old fashioned American students who happened to be Muslims. Do you think they’d be allowed to continue their takeover for 41 days? Do you think they’d be acquitted at trial? Those young men would likely be taken to Gitmo. I’m not even kidding. \\nReally? So that’s why this country allows in refugees that we can’t properly vet and refuses to monitor known radical mosques…because things are so biased against Muslims? \\nApparently King has never heard of things called hate crime laws or affirmative action — two things that represent the true “systemic racism” plaguing this country. \\nWhat kind of “white privilege” did the more than 80 white people killed — including women and children — in the Waco siege have, Mr. King? \\nPeople like King really do live in a fantasy land of alleged racism, that is self-imposed by their inability and/or unwillingness to critically think for themselves. Then again, there’s a lot of money to be made in peddling racial division based on lies, so it certainly could be that as well… '],\n",

       "  'Email The majesty of nature is awe-inspiring, and don’t worry, we’ve got plenty of those monkeys with the giant red asses. 1. We’re not going to leave you hanging, wondering when the swollen red asses are going to show up. Here’s one monkey ass to start this list of beautiful nature photos off right. 2. Elsewhere in nature, the blue whale is the largest animal in Earth’s history, even bigger than the dinosaurs! And if you think we blew our entire red-assed money wad on that first one, then you are seriously mistaken. 3. The Alaskan wood frog has the amazing ability to freeze in winter and thaw itself out when the weather gets warm again. It sounds like something out of science fiction, and while it isn’t a hulking red monkey ass, it’s still an impressive example of the power of evolution. 4. No way we’d skimp on monkeys with bulbous red buttocks. That’s not how we treat our readers. When we promise inflamed red monkey asses, we deliver in spades. Feast your eyes on these remarkable specimens. 5. More monkeys with beacon-like red asses are coming up, but in the meantime here is the hummingbird moth. At first glance, you’d mistake it for a bird, but it’s actually an insect that happens to look like a hummingbird, which is pretty cool if you think about it. 6. Once again, it’s time to behold red monkey ass, and this time there’s a whole gaggle of monkeys with blindingly bright asses. But this isn’t the end of the red assfest, no siree. This we promise. 7. Chimpanzees are our closest cousins in nature, with an almost human-like intelligence. They sadly were not blessed with a bright-red ass but are smart enough to use simple tools like sticks to catch termites. You can’t help but wonder about humanity’s place in nature when you see a creature so similar to us. 8. We’ve got a real showstopper of a red ass on deck, but first let’s do our due diligence and check out the Galápagos tortoise. It can live over 170 years. Incredible. 9. Here we go! This monkey has a truly huge red ass, much bigger and redder than any ass we’ve seen before. We are fortunate to share a planet with a bloated red miracle as beautiful as this monkey’s breathtaking ass. Red monkey asses are nature at its finest, and we hope you’ve had your fill of them.

       "  'U.S. \\nRemember the last Super Bowl and Beyoncé’s half-time performance? Remember how it seemed reminiscent of the Black Panthers? Well, she is at her anti-cop rhetoric once again, and there have been some deleterious results. \\nHours after Beyoncé called on black people to take a stand, someone got the memo and massacred police officers at a protest, as per Downtrend. Although this actually happened last July, it takes on added significance considering more police officers were ambushed over the last few days. \\nThis seems to be a recurrent theme, and it needs to stop. Our police officers deserve respect and to be safe from targeted violence! \\nDon’t get me wrong, racism is still a problem in our country, but race-baiting isn’t helping. In fact, it’s hurting! \\nRace-baiting is, of course, old hat to individuals like Beyoncé, who gain part of their fame from their status as famous black artists, not just as famous artists. \\nHowever, liberals such as Beyoncé have yet to realize a couple of key principles. When you stoke the flames of racial tension, things invariably get worse. \\nYou promote a double standard when you call on people to rise up. This double standard led to a San Antonio police detective getting shot and killed just a few days ago. The perpetrator of the crime even admitted a few things about the motivation for his crime, which has raised concerns across the nation. \\n“I lashed out at somebody who didn’t deserve it,” this perpetrator said. While most people will celebrate the holidays, the San Antonio Police Department is going to be arranging a funeral for the latest victim of violence. A family will be in mourning. \\nThis tension has been brewing for a few decades now. This type of victim mentality has started with the liberalism that has infiltrated every institution in our country. \\nNowadays, people are happy to cry racism even at the smallest slight. It has led to an inevitable conclusion: the violence against police officers has increased. However, while these men are just doing their job and getting killed for it, the true perpetrators of the crime will never be charged. \\nThose who incite violence against police officers deserve some serious consequences. \\nThis definitely includes the racist Beyoncé, who has contributed to violence against innocent, honorable Americans.

Such is the preposterous hypocrisy of US leaders and their international network of cronies.\\nUS client regime Saudi Arabia \\x96 the world\\'s most repressive \\x96 being given a seat on the UN human rights council over the weekend while Russia was forced out of it is just one glaring insult among many.\\nRussia\\x92s top diplomat was referring to US officials and Western allies accusing Russia of \\x93barbarism\\x94 and \\x93war crimes\\x94 in its ongoing military intervention in Syria.\\nYet these unverified, hysterical charges that Washington levels against Moscow in Syria are proven against the US and its allies who have committed huge war crimes in dozens of countries over recent years. Crimes that go unaccounted for.\\nLavrov cited the case of former Yugoslavia in particular where, in 1999, US-led NATO warplanes killed thousands of civilians in air strikes on public infrastructure. Since then, illegal overseas wars launched by Washington \\x96 in brazen violation of international law \\x96 have proliferated with a death toll counted in millions.\\nCurrently, US forces are bombing seven countries, including Iraq, Syria and Yemen, inflicting civilian deaths on a daily basis. Yet it is Washington and its Western minions who have the audacity to condemn Russia over its military operations to salvage Syria from a US-led covert war for regime change. That the US has orchestrated a criminal covert war in Syria since March 2011 \\x96 violating the human rights of millions of Syrians \\x96 is a shocking reality that only the servile Western media continues to conceal.\\nLast week, the Western propaganda campaign to demonize Russia scored a dubious \\x93victory\\x94 by having Russia dropped from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). That move was achieved on the back of a media-driven agenda claiming that Russian air strikes were indiscriminately targeting civilians in the northern Syria city of Aleppo.\\nNever mind that Russian (and Syrian) aircraft have not been carrying out combat missions around Aleppo for nearly two weeks in order to facilitate humanitarian aid efforts in the war-torn city. Never mind that those aid efforts have been continually sabotaged by foreign-backed terrorist groups holding civilians under siege in eastern Aleppo for the past four years.\\nRussia\\x92s military intervention in Syria over the past year has helped Syrian government forces liberate hundreds of towns and villages from a reign of terror imposed by foreign-backed mercenaries, all of which are integrated with the internationally outlawed terrorist networks Islamic State (Daesh) and Nusra Front. None of this is given any acknowledgment by the West and its subservient news media, which instead inverts reality by amplifying spurious claims leveled against Russia by the terrorist sponsors.\\nThe battle for Aleppo is fully consistent with the objective of liberating Syria from a US-led criminal conspiracy to destroy the country and to replace the elected government of President Bashar al-Assad with a pro-Western puppet regime.\\nOver the weekend, Western media strained credulity by referring to \\x93rebels breaking the regime\\x92s siege on Aleppo\\x94. These so-called rebels are none other than Al Qaeda-linked terrorists of Nusra Front and its myriad offshoots, like Ahrar al-Sham and Jaish al-Fatah. It isn\\x92t the Syrian army and its Russian ally that are holding the city siege. It is the terrorists. And over the weekend their shelling resulting in dozens of civilians being killed, including reportedly 14 children in government-held western Aleppo.\\nEven the abjectly one-sided Western media could not conceal the slaughter by terrorist \\x93rebels\\x94 whom the United States and its allies have supported with money, weapons and training to do their geopolitical bidding in Syria since 2011.\\nMeanwhile, in neighboring Iraq, a US coalition that includes Britain, France and Turkey continued bombing the city of Mosul, ostensibly to defeat extremists holding a civilian population as human shields \\x96 extremists whom the US and its partners have covertly supported next door in Syria. US-led aerial bombardment of Mosul has resulted in heavy civilian casualties since the offensive was launched on October 17, according to local sources.\\nElsewhere over the weekend, Saudi warplanes, supported by the US, Britain and France, ratcheted up even more crimes against humanity. Some 10,000 people have been killed since the Saudi coalition began bombing the region\\x92s poorest country in March 2015. In an air strike on the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, Saudi warplanes attacked a prison, killing more than 60 inmates and security staff. It was just the latest atrocity in a litany of such deadly strikes on civilian centers, including hospitals, schools, markets, mosques, family homes and even funeral halls.\\nLast week, UN agencies reported that nearly half the Yemeni population of 24 million is facing starvation. Images of skeletal children are emerging, wracked by dysentery and cholera. This barbaric nationwide ordeal has been created by the Saudi regime and its Western patrons imposing a sea and air blockade on the country. It is no exaggeration to say that the whole Yemeni nation is an imprisoned population that is being bombed over and over without the slightest compunction for women and children being blown to pieces.\\nWithout American, British and French military support the Saudi slaughter in Yemen would cease immediately. Western-backed Saudi claims of Iranian subversion in Yemen, from allegedly supporting Houthi rebels, are a risible pretext. Washington and its clients are destroying Yemen simply because they can\\x92t abide a popular, genuinely pro-democracy uprising succeeding in a vital oil-rich region that underpins US hegemony through despotic Arab rule, as in Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchical dictatorships.\\nOn the same weekend that Russia was sanctioned at the UNHRC, it was yet another blood-soaked orgy of state-sponsored terrorism carried out by the US, its allies and their mercenary surrogates.\\nThe US, Britain, France and Saudi Arabia are among the 47 member states represented on the Geneva-based human rights council. The Saudi feudalist monarchy, which executes prisoners convicted of \\x93sorcery\\x94 and other crimes by public beheading, and which bans women from driving cars, only obtained its seat on the UNHRC due to Britain fixing the votes.\\nRussia, which has stood against the terrorist-sponsoring aggression in Syria by Washington and its rogue-state partners, is singled out for sanction over allegations of committing violations.\\nThis censure is insulting because not only is it a travesty of justice. It is an insult to common intelligence which can see through the preposterous lies of the US and its accomplices.\\nThe utter disconnect and deception by Washington and other Western governments may fool some of the people some of the time, but over the long-run such corruption is coming unstuck. The turmoil, anger and disdain among ordinary people towards criminals in high office is reaching boiling point in the US, Europe and across the world.\\nThe more that these illegitimate rulers seek to justify their existence and criminal enterprises the more it offends ordinary human intelligence.\\nRussia is right to be aggrieved by the public insults that emanate from Washington and its lackeys. But Russia is certainly not alone in being grotesquely wronged. The whole world is aggrieved by putting up so far with an international oligarchy of thieves, exploiters and sponsors of terrorism.

       " ['The Yale Review Did Not Endorse Hillary. The Reason Why Is Hilarious',\n",
       "  'Posted on October 27, 2016 \\nThe editorial board at the Yale Review gave the most curious non-endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this election season has yet seen – and with a lesson that most of the Republican political complex and especially nominee Donald Trump should learn, quickly, if he wants to keep himself out of even more legal trouble. \\nIn its 144-year history, The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. In fact, we have never endorsed any candidate for president. This is, in part, due to our strong commitment to being a tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, which mandates that we are “absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.” \\nThis year’s presidential election is highly unusual, but ultimately no different: The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally un-endorsable, due to our faithful compliance with the tax code. \\nIn particular, we do not endorse Hillary Clinton’s exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye. We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this country—a commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career. Because of unambiguous tax law, we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history, nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8. \\nThe Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr. Jill Stein. \\nTax-exempt organizations like The Yale Record and the Donald J Trump Foundation must obey certain rules to keep their tax-exempt status – rules that the Trump Foundation has been flouting for its entire existence. Trump’s been using his private foundation – which is funded almost entirely by the donations of other people – to purchase the political support of different groups throughout his campaign , among other more personal purchases like a $20,000 painting of himself , in clear violation of the tax-exempt rules. \\nTrump’s foundation has already been suspended from operating in New York for not having the right certification to solicit donors . Such a flagrant disrespect for the laws of the land and of the spirit of “charity” reveal just what kind of man Donald Trump is – a greedy narcissist with no regard for the well-being of others. So take this non-endorsement to heart and applaud their respect for the rules governing tax-exempt organizations. OccupyDemocrats, however, is under no such restrictions, and we heartily encourage you to help shatter the glass ceiling and make former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton our next president. '],\n",
       " ['Reduce Nurse Burnout by Treating Nurses as Well as We Treat Patients',\n",
       "  'Prev post Page 1 of 4 Next \\nNurses are among the most underappreciated professionals in the world. They care for us from the time we enter the hospital to the time we leave. They care for our loved ones during the most difficult and terrifying times of our lives. To put it simply, they save lives. \\nNot only that; they save multiple lives every day. Because we are so troubled by whatever issues has brought us to the hospital, we rarely think of the nearly incomprehensible amount of stress that is put upon the person caring for us. This is understandable. When we are in the hospital, we are usually at our very worst and not in the mood to care for the troubles of others. \\nAssuming the reader is not a nurse, put yourself in that position for a moment. Every day, the healthy, safety and livelihood of multiple individuals are in your hands. You may be overworked and heavily burdened, but you do not have the benefit of going on “cruise control” like many other professionals do some days. Any mistakes could cause serious consequences. Theresa Brown , a columnist for the The New York Times and registered nurse for over five years, may have said it best, “It’s not like being a waiter, where you have too many tables, which is stressful, but no one’s going to die if they don’t get their entree in time.” \\nThis why it is not difficult to understand how many of America’s nurses are getting burned out. In fact, a recent survey of forty different hospital units found that over one third of nurses reported that they intend to leave their position within the next year. This is a startling concept to imagine one third of the world’s nurses quitting. In the study, they cited two main reasons for this: emotional exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment. \\nOne could see how they could feel emotionally exhausted, but to think that the people who dedicate their lives caring for the sick do not feel accomplished or appreciated enough? That shows that the problem may not be with the nurses, but for those around them. \\nSo, how do we fix this? Nurse burnout is a common problem, and there are multiple ideas and schools of thought as to how we should deal with it. However, to develop a proper solution, we must first fully understand the problem and its root causes. Although we do not profess to offer one grand solution that can solve nurse burn out, we do hope to examine the problem and hopefully provide some understanding.

       "  'Tom Cahill | November 11, 2016 \\nA brilliant guide showing bystanders what to do when seeing Islamophobia in public is spreading on social media. \\nThe guide instructs friendly bystanders to do four things in succession: Converse with the victim while ignoring the attacker, focus on a random subject of conversation that doesn’t involve anything the attacker is talking about, maintain eye contact with the victim while refusing to engage with the attacker, and continue friendly conversation until the attacker leaves, while offering to escort the victim to a safe space. \\nThe illustrated guide, made by artist Maeril , is a 4-step guide that simultaneously shows how a bystander can make an Islamophobic attacker irrelevant while at the same time providing the victim with a safe space. Maeril, who lives in France, originally designed it for bystanders wanting to make Muslim citizens feel welcome after the terror attacks in Paris and Nice, said on her Tumblr that the guide can actually be used to help those being targeted by various forms of hatred and racism. Maeril asked those planning on following the guide to make sure to do two things: \\n1) Do not, in any way, interact with the attacker. You must absolutely ignore them and focus entirely on the person being attacked! \\n2) Please make sure to always respect the wishes of the person you’re helping: whether they want you to leave quickly afterwards, or not! If you’re in a hurry escort them to a place where someone else can take over — call one of their friends, or one of yours, of if they want to, the police. It all depends on how they feel! \\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News, Maeril said the guide is based on a psychological technique called “Non-complementary behavior,” in which a person adopts the polar opposite behavior of someone else. In this instance, non-complementary behavior means acting in a warm and friendly way toward someone who is experiencing hostile behavior from someone else. \\nThis guide will likely become essential over the next four years as hate crimes are already being reported across the country in the wake of Donald Trump’s election to the presidency.

       " [\"Vox Editor: 'I Have Written There's 0 Evidence The Clinton Foundation Was Used For Personal Family Enrichment. Looks Like I Was Wrong' | RedFlag News\",\n",
       "  '\\nJeff Stein | VOX \\nHillary Clinton found herself in a no-win dilemma as she moved to launch her presidential run while also aiding her husband’s globe-trotting philanthropy — and her team knew it. \\nSometime before announcing her candidacy, Clinton had agreed to go to a Clinton Global Initiative fundraiser in Morocco planned for May 2015. The king of Morocco had personally pledged to give $12 million with the understanding she’d attend, according to emails released last week by WikiLeaks. \\nBut then there was the awkward fact that Clinton would be running for president by then. That set up a bind: Go to the event, and Clinton would be appearing to indulge a foreign government known for egregious human right abuses to help her family’s private charity. Pull out, and Clinton would be going back on her word to the Moroccan king. \\n“The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting. It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months,” Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote in an email in November 2014, several months before Clinton declared her candidacy. “She created this mess.” \\nHillary Clinton ultimately decided against attending, and Chelsea Clinton and Bill Clinton went instead. (Politico has reported a Moroccan phosphate export firm gave “at least” $1 million, but it’s not clear if the other $11 million came through. The foundation doesn’t have to disclose the gift and has declined to confirm one way or another to reporters.) \\nBut since this story broke late last week, Clinton has been getting attacked for it far and wide. And this time it’s not just Donald Trump and Fox News: Even mainstream outlets like the Atlantic and the Associated Press have published tough pieces about the controversy. (The Huffington Post said it amounted to a “brutal, clean hit” on the Democratic nominee.) \\nThis controversy has stoked wildly misleading allegations implying that Clinton is corrupt, even in some leading news outlets. But while those claims are overblown, the story still illustrates how the foundation helped put wealthy donors into Clinton’s orbit — and allowed them to buy a rare chance to shape her perspective that few average Americans will ever get.

       " ['CIA’s Brainwashing Mayhem is in the Full Swing in the EU | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Europe It is now an undisputed fact that the Western democratic values and the so-called “freedom of speech” that have been heralded for a long time as the principal achievements of the Western world are nothing but empty slogans. This is evidenced by the latest resolution of the European Parliament on countering Russia’s media influence dubbed the “EU strategic communications with a view to counteracting propaganda.” This document was initiated by a Polish member of the European Parliament, Anna Fotyga who claims that Russia has been providing financial support to opposition political parties and organizations in the EU, thereby undermining the unity of its states. It is noteworthy that the authors behind this document are speaking about the necessity of media pluralism and freedom of information, while introducing a form of censorship against all Russian media sources. At the same time those behind this curious paper advocate the revocation of Article 55 of Chapter IX of the UN Charter, which demands a universal respect and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone, regardless of their race, sex, language or religion, including the rights to freedom of expression. It’s curious that delusional which hunts and the suppression of alternative media sources has recently become one of the principal attributes of the European politics. This is clearly shown by the report that has been presented by Dr Andrew Foxall, the Director of the Russia Studies Centre at The Henry Jackson Society, that advocates the notion that activists, journalists, and politicians should point out the pro-Russian connections of individuals and parties across the political spectrum and challenge the credibility of these entities via political debates, while personal and organizational connections of left- and right-wing politicians and parties and their Russian counterparts should be mapped across Europe. It’s curious that Dr Marcus Papadopoulos, the editor in chief of Politics First has been outraged by the above mentioned report, calling it manifestation of a modern form of McCarthyism. Papadopoulos is convinced that this is nothing but a slap in the face of freedom of speech and a rather stupid attempt to try to silence those who disagree with with the UK government. It’s curious that UK politicians are convinced they can call “idiots” anybody who disagrees with their position. Moreover, the “Foxall’s proclamation” was released on the eve of the discussion of the EU strategic communications with a view to counteracting propaganda in the EU parliament and has become a sort of foundation for this document. This means that the Operation Mockingbird that was launched by the CIA in the 1950s hasn’t been discontinued and is now being implemented in the EU. If you take a look at the rapidly growing funding of the European corporate media sources, it becomes obvious that America’s loyal puppets have been busy producing disinformation on the massive scale. Every day we witness new articles being published that have nothing in common with reality, yet no amount of evidence can force those corporate media sources to confess that they’ve been deliberately lying. Just take a look at the role Western media played in the Ukrainian crisis, where Russia’s position is just being ignored by every single Western journal and newspaper. Yet, the fact that Russia hasn’t been preparing any sort of occupation of Ukraine has been proven by France’s military intelligence, General Christophe Gomart in the speech he delivered in front of the French National Assembly. Yet, his report was just ignored. It must be clearly understood that a web of deception is always being created by the CIA in those regions and in those periods when specific Washington’s actions may become the cause of serious criticism and may lead to the manifestation of one’s independence from the United States. For this purpose, the White House annually allocates billions of dollars to the National Endowment for Democracy, USAID, the CIA and countless NGOs to spread disinformation. However, such steps are not causing alarm among European politicians, that are subjecting their people to vassal dependency on Washington and its position. Back in 2011 the Guardian would report : The US military is developing software that will let it secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro-American propaganda. A Californian corporation has been awarded a contract with United States Central Command (Centcom), which oversees US armed operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, to develop what is described as an “online persona management service” that will allow one US serviceman or woman to control up to 10 separate identities based all over the world. The multiple persona contract is thought to have been awarded as part of a programme called Operation Earnest Voice (OEV), which was first developed in Iraq as a psychological warfare weapon against the online presence of al-Qaida supporters and others ranged against coalition forces. Since then, OEV is reported to have expanded into a $200m programme and is thought to have been used against jihadists across Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Middle East. Today we can witness the direct result of this program on most European forums, where those dissatisfied with their elected officials are being subjected to harassment and trolling. Yes, the delusional notion about the so-called “Russian propaganda” is the talk of the day in the EU, while the aggressive Washington’s disinformation campaign is being silently ignored, as if nothing of interest was happening in this domain.

       " ['Evidence: Eating Raw Cannabis PREVENTS Cancer, Does NOT Get You High',\n",
       "  'There is evidence out there, supporting that cannabis oil destroys cancer , cures severe epilepsy , treats muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, and saves lives . The National Cancer Institute has admitted cannabis oil kills cancer cells . It is widely acknowledged that natural compounds of the cannabis — a plant that the use, sale, and possession of is still illegal in the United States — can prevent, treat and manage inflammation; neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis; brain disorders such as epilepsy; lifestyle related diseases such as diabetes and cancer; chronic liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis; and medical conditions such as fibromyalgia.\\nMeanwhile, experts have come forward to make a strong case for eating unheated raw cannabis for maximum health benefits. While smoked or vaporized cannabis can be used as a medicinal therapy, they claim, eating raw cannabis can help prevent health issues from arising altogether — without psychoactive effect.\\nDr. William Courtney, a California-based physician and a dietary raw cannabis specialist , says we are actually walking away from 99% of the benefits cannabis provides when we cook or smoke cannabis. He explains:\\n“In its raw form, the cannabis plant contains both THCA (Tetra Hydro Cannabinolic-Acid) and CBDA (Cannabidiolic-Acid), two cannabinoids known for their medicinal benefits; each of which must be heated in order to produce THC and CBD, respectively. Only when you decarboxylate THCA, turning it into THC, does it cause psychoactive effects or “the high” most associated with smoking cannabis.\\n“Additionally, the body is able to tolerate larger dosages of cannabinoids when cannabis is consumed in the raw form. This is because when you smoke cannabis, the THC actually acts as a CB1 receptor agonist and your body can only absorb 10 mg at a time.\\n“If you don’t heat cannabis, you can go up to five or six hundred milligrams and use the plant strictly as a dietary supplement by upping the anti-oxidant and neuro-protective levels which come into play at hundreds of milligrams of CBDA and THCA. It is this dramatic increase in dose from 10 mg of psychoactive THC to the 500 mg – 1,000 mg of non-psychoactive THCA, CBDA, and CBGA that comprises the primary difference between traditional medical cannabis treatments and using cannabis as a dietary supplement.”\\nIt is no secret that cannabis contains a wealth of nutrients , proteins, vitamins, terpenes, Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, essential amino acids, and antioxidants. When eaten raw, our body is able to process much larger amounts of THCA and CBDA — which possess anti-inflammatory properties, anti-diabetic properties, and anti-ischemic properties — and converts these cannabinoid acids — linked to the prevention of chronic diseases such as migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, glaucoma, and fibromyalgia — into essential nutrients through its metabolism.'],\n",

       "  'Home / News / Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did…Here’s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did…Here’s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate fisher 4 mins ago News Comments Off on Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did…Here’s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did…Here’s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Clinton stood before millions of Americans last night and told numerous lies, then said things like “Google it”, suggesting we fact check her…so we did and found 6 major lies, plus others. FACT CHECK #1 – Hillary Clinton claimed that Planned Parenthood “provides cancer screenings” and therefore should not be de-funded, in spite of controversy about abortion. Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE This is a repeated claim deployed in defense of Planned Parenthood, but it is not true, at least as regards breast cancer. As the left-leaning Washington Post ’s fact-checker wrote in 2015: When Democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that Planned Parenthood “provides” mammograms, this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the X-rays. The group does not “provide” mammograms. Rather, the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies, X-rays or other specialized services. It is slightly more accurate to say that women have “access” to mammograms via Planned Parenthood, though it’s still slippery language. FACT CHECK #2 – Hillary Clinton responded to a question about Supreme Court and gun rights by saying, “I support the Second Amendment.” Fact-Check: FALSE When Clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) decision: a decision dealing with the foundations of the Second Amendment; the very roots of what it protects. In the Heller ruling, SCOTUS reaffirmed that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms. This decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia, politics and journalism trying to persuade Americans that the Second Amendment protects a collective right. (If collective, the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or today’s military or police forces.) So Heller is crucial. In fact, it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire Second Amendment rests on it. Yet Hillary disagrees the Heller ruling. Her spokesman Josh Schwerin said Hillary believes Heller was “ wrongly decided .” So how can a woman who does not believe in an “individual” right to keep and bear arms support the Second Amendment? She can’t. Incidentally, Clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the Heller decision was the way the SCOTUS applied the Second Amendment in that case. For those of you who may not know, Heller centered on Washington DC’s gun ban–which was subsequently struck down via the SCOTUS decision. To oppose the application of the Second Amendment in Heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned. That is not supporting the Second Amendment. FACT CHECK #3 – Hillary Clinton said during the third presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday that she “will not add a penny to the debt” if elected president. Fact-Check: FALSE Indeed, Hillary Clinton’s claim is not even close to true. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts that under Clinton’s policies , the debt would increase by $9 trillion over a decade. “Clinton’s plan would increase both spending and revenue,” the Washington, D.C.-based independent non-profit’s analyst said . “Under our preliminary updated central estimate, she would increase primary spending by $1.65 trillion over the next decade, including about $500 billion of spending on college education, $300 billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure, and significant new health-related spending.” FACT CHECK #4 – Hillary Clinton claimed that “33,000 people a year…die from guns.” Fact-Check: FALSE This is a claim Clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control; to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the American people safe. However, a Fact-Check shows Clinton’s claim is not only false, but is exaggerated by 66 percent. She is using figures from 2013, and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year. Clinton first began making this claim in November 2015, repeated it in April 2016, and has since repeated it again and again. In April Breitbart News highlighted the method Clinton used to swell the numbers: In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 11,208 firearm-related homicides in the United States. An additional 505 accidental firearm-related deaths occurred in the US–a figure that pales in comparison to the 38,851 deaths by accidental poisoning or the 30,208 deaths caused by falls. So Clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides. In this way, 11,713 firearm-related deaths–homicides and accidental deaths–quickly become 32,888 “gun violence” deaths in 2013 and an impetus for gun control. FACT CHECK #5 – Hillary Clinton praised President Obama ’s economic performance, adding: “He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.” Fact-Check: FALSE This repeated Democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through Obama ’s first year in office, after the $862 billion stimulus, the massive omnibus spending bill (“porkulus”), and the deployment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was signed by Obama ’s predecessor but for which he voted. As Breitbart News noted when President Obama claimed in January to have cut the deficit by “almost three-quarters”: This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it’s not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office–which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He “cut” (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010. The truth is that Obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and ill-conceived experiment in Keynesian stimulus spending, much of which was wasted on priorities that helped Obama ’s political supporters — especially the public sector unions — but did little for the economy. FACT CHECK #6 – Hillary Clinton said “We at the Clinton Foundation spend ninety percent — ninety percent — of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.” Fact-Check: FALSE Indeed, Clinton’s “ninety percent” claim is false according to her troubled charity’s own t ax filings . Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute , Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, and author of Clinton Cash said the Clinton Foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors. “If you actually look at the numbers of their filings and 990s, that’s what it indicates,” Schweizer said last month in an interview with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily . “The Clinton Foundation will say, ‘We assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.’ Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don’t really tell you. They don’t really explain to you how it works.” “So the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities,” Schweizer continued. “The other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it’s really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.” What’s more? Political analyst Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist and a former adviser to Sen. Tom Coburn and Gov. Rick Perry, examined the Clinton Foundation’s 2013 tax filings and found that “ Hillary Clinton’s non-profit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants.” “The Clinton Foundation spent nearly $8.5 million–10 percent of all 2013 expenditures–on travel,” Davis contends . “Nearly $4.8 million–5.6 percent of all expenditures–was spent on office supplies.” (Source: Check out over 20 more Fact Checks at Breitbart) So there you have it, folks.

       " ['RT’s Bank Accounts Closed – It’s Nothing to Do With Syria | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Russia in the World As the world now knows, British bank NatWest, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland group, has told Russian media outlet RT that it should take its business elsewhere. Initially it was reported that the bank had “frozen” RT’s accounts, meaning it had impounded the money, but it now says that the accounts have merely been closed, meaning that RT can withdraw its money – provided it then takes it to another bank . NatWest, and the rest of the Royal Bank of Scotland group, are effectively owned by the British government, which acquired the majority share in 2008 to prevent it collapsing. As RT is also state-owned, it has been inferred that this is another form of sanction. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson denies this, but he also denies several of his chidren, several parts of his ancestry and practically everything else he has ever written or been recorded saying. It has also been suggested that this move, which came without warning, was connected with potential fines against the bank for holding money considered “dirty” by association with Russia – though the government fining itself to pay itself seems unlikely. It may therefore be simply a publicity stunt – the UK has to be seen to be acting against Russia as part of the sanctions regime, and may be perfectly happy for RT to take its business to a private UK bank, or even another publicly-owned one, having done its bit of public posturing. However the real reason for this move is not sanctions against the Russian state. It is because a seemingly unimportant event has the potential to shake the foundations of the United Kingdom – and those in the corridors of power have just woken up to it. The closing of RT’s accounts, if it finally happens, may simply be a symbolic gesture, but it may be the precursor to a more serious crisis, which no one thought they would ever see again. The subtext beneath the subtext From October 15-18 Kyril, Patriarch of Moscow, visited the United Kingdom. There is a growing Orthodox diaspora in the UK, as there is in all Western countries, and also a small but well-established British-born Orthodox community and a number of majority British, English-language parishes . However Orthodoxy is still a very small religion there – though figures are hard to come by, no more than 7 % o f the population would curently identify themselves as Orthodox, despite the large Greek Cypriot community which owns the plurality of the UK’s Orthodox churches. The Church of England adheres to a doctrine called Branch Theory – the idea that various different Christian “denominations”, as they call them, are branches of the same basic church. Consequently religious leaders in general are treated with respect, even if people greatly disagree with their faith. When Pope John Paul II visited the UK in 1982 he was treated as a pop star, despite a few insignificant protests by Protestant or far-right groups. No particular fuss is made when leaders of other faiths enter the country from abroad, despite the hysteria surrounding so-called “Muslim hate preachers” who are no more radical than the Bible-bashers who have the greatest objection to them. But how was Patriarch Kyril treated? With respect by those who met him – but not by the media or the political class. When Archbishop Makarios, who had been a politician in public office contrary to the Canons of the Church, visited the UK in the 1970s he was shown entering churches and attracting crowds who cheered him so hard they damaged the buildings. Patriarch Kyril was presented as an apologist for Vladimir Putin and Russia’s alleged actions in Syria, who had been sent on a propaganda mission . The Patriarch was not in the UK to talk politics, and there is no suggestion that he actually did so. The focus of his visit was to finally consecrate the Russian cathedral at Ennismore Gardens, London, a former Anglican church which the Russian church has been using since the 1950s. But the thing which most upset certain commentators was the fact that he was due to have an audience with the Queen, as visiting dignitaries usually do . The implication of the widespread concern about the Queen agreeing to this private meeting was that she was sympathetic to Russia’s position on Syria. The UK has a constitutional monarchy, and consequently the Queen does not dictate government policy. If the Queen has a personal position on anything she will only make it public if she feels her government is making a serious error and will not listen to reason – which has happened only once during her 64-year reign, when she famously let it be known that she felt Margaret Thatcher’s policies were damaging the social fabric of the country. So why should the press and politicians be so outraged about the possibility of Patriarch Kyril giving the Queen opinions she can read on the internet, or in some of the hundreds of letters she receives daily from disgruntled citizens? Because they are trying to disguise the real reason for their fear. It has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with the Orthodox Church, which happens to be the majority religion in Russia. No one minds ordinary citizens taking an interest in Orthodoxy. But the Royal Family? That’s a different question entirely. The invisible heart of the state The Queen is not only a monarch but the head of the Church of England. Though it seems anomalous to others that a church is run by a secular ruler, who could not even be ordained a bishop in that church if she wanted to, this is the way it has been since Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 so he could get a divorce. The state that became the UK was built on the Anglican faith and the political assumptions that went with that, despite the non-Anglican majorities in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. For three hundred and fifty years the “Catholic Powers” were seen as national enemies in the same way the “Iron Curtain” countries were in the second half of the twentieth century. Consequently each member of the Royal Family is also obliged to uphold the primacy of the Church of England, whether they are religious or not. From time to time, this has created problems. The Abdication Crisis of 1936 was caused by the King of England wanting to marry a twice-divorced woman, which the church considered a no-no at the time . Similarly, Tony Blair only announced his conversion to Roman Catholicism after he had resigned as Prime Minister, because the PM is included in the line of succession to the throne, and could be an atheist but not a Papist in that role. The question of whether the Church of England accepts divorce and remarriage – which is not at all clear cut – has reared its head several times in recent years due to the marital problems of the Royal Family. Prince Charles and Princess Anne have divorced and remarried, each time conducting their second marriages outside the Church of England. If Charles does eventually succeed to the throne, the question of whether he can be head of the Church of England whilst divorced and remarried outside it will come back to the forefront. In 1977 a story went round the press that Charles was about to marry Princess Marie Astrid of Luxembourg. According to sources close to the action a marriage had actually been arranged behind the scenes, but did not proceed because the princess refused to give up her Roman Catholic faith, as she would be obliged to do to marry the future king under the Act of Succession of 1701. However Buckingham Palace responded to the reports by saying that Charles didn’t even know the princess, a ridiculous assertion, as all Europe’s royals are related and attend functions where they meet each other. This demonstrates how deep the fear of rocking the constitutional boat by not supporting the C of E runs . The Queen’s husband, Prince Philip, was born and baptised Orthodox, as a Prince of Greece. He renounced his Faith to marry Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, and regularly attends Anglican services with the rest of the family. However it is an open secret that he has returned to Orthodoxy privately. He is known to make very generous donations to Orthodox churches and causes and is a patron of the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies in Cambridge. Prince Charles also has a longstanding interest in Orthodoxy: amongst other expressions of it, he has refused to join the Freemasons, despite this being expected of members of the British upper class. When the Queen met the Pope on his 1982 visit it caused some comment, but nothing like the controversy provoked by her meeting Patriarch Kyril. If the UK ever started to support Putin’s position on anything it would not be the end of civilization as we know it. If the heir to the throne converted to his father’s ancestral faith, and the link between the state and the Church of England was forcibly broken, it would call the whole political basis of the UK into question. That is a can of worms no one dares open – for which RT is now being made the scapegoat, because no one is prepared to publicly discuss just how big a question this seemingly abstruse point really is. Foreign is the new cancer British banks are entitled to freeze accounts under certain circumstances. If an account contains the proceeds of crime, these can now be impounded by the courts. Similarly it is a criminal offence in the UK, under the Terrorism Act 2000, to provide financial or any other support to terrorists, regardless of what the UK government itself does . Banks are terrified of this law, and interpret it with a strictness which is itself illegal. There have been many instances of ethnic minority commuity organisations being unable to open bank accounts unless they sack their officers and appoint British people, on the grounds that simply by being run by foreigners they might be laundering money for terrorists. So if there is any hint of impropriety about an organisation run by a foreign state, they will naturally review that information to protect themselves. But it is usually the courts who impound the proceeds of crime. The arbitrary closure of RT’s accounts, without explanation, therefore implies that it is being accused of sponsoring terrorism. Theresa May’s response that “ it is for them [the bank] to decide who they offer services to based on their own risk appetite ” suggests that this is exactly what the government wants to accuse it of. Who said anything about risk being the reason, and how does the government know about the decisions the bank makes on individual acco u nts and the reasons for them? So the assumption that this is about Syria suits the narrative we have heard to date. But if so, why now? Has the bank only just become nervous of being fined by its own owners? Is it only now aware of the sanctions regime, or the British government’s position on this conflict? The Church of England, the pillar on which the British state was built, has long had ostensibly good relations with the Orthodox communities in the UK. Many Orthodox parishes worship in former or still-functioning Anglican churches, and successive Archbishops of Canterbury have expressed their respect for Orthodoxy. Until, that is, the Church stops being a weird foreign sect. Then it becomes a threat which has to be dealt with, and always is. In 1988 the head of the Greek Orthodox Church in the UK, Archbishop Methodios, was deposed for “coveting other thrones”, whatever that may mean. It was widely believed that the real reason was because the Church of England objected to him receiving a number of its priests and many ordinary parishioners. He was replaced by Archbishop Gregorios, who began by stating publicly many times that he did not encourage people to convert to the Church he served. A student in Greece wrote a thesis about the deposition of Archbishop Methodios, which the university not only refused to publish but used as an excuse to kick him out of university. The website of the Greek Archdiocese in the UK makes no mention of why Methodios ceased to be bishop, or what he did subsequently, despite the fact he lived another eighteen years as a titular bishop . Now the head of another Orthodox national jurisdiction has visited the UK and been vilified in a way unprecendented for a religious leader since Catholics were allowed back into the country. Rather than being met with protests from angry Britishers, he was received with the traditional courtesy of religious leaders. His potential to destabilise the state does not derive from his connections but from the potential willingness of members of the officially Anglican Royal Family to embrace his Faith. So that Faith must be presented as politically dangerous, its hierarchs as political stooges, to scare people, and their Royal Family, away from it. RT has been inundated with messages of support from UK citizens. Most of these assume that the bank’s decision is politically motivated. Indeed it is – but it is the identity of the UK and its institutions, rather than whether you think Assad is a terrorist, which is the political issue driving it. \\nSeth Ferris, investigative journalist and political scientist, expert on Middle Eastern affairs, exclusively for the online magazine “ New Eastern Outlook ”.

But the truth is Trump also won Michigan with 16 EC votes and Arizona with 11 EC votes for a total of 306 EC votes.

       "  '\\nNo parent ever wants to find out that their child is sexting. \\nBut if happens, how far is too far when it comes to teaching them a lesson? \\nLast week, a 13-year-old girl from Riverside, California, could be seen “bawling her eyes out” on the corner of a busy intersection as she held a handwritten sign that read: \\n“I\\'m 13 and I ask for d*ck pics.” Image Credit: Screenshot/ NBC LA \\nAccording to NBC LA, the teen was forced to be publicly humiliated by her parents after they found out she was sexting. \\nWitnesses said the teen had been standing near the busy street for hours while her mother kept watch from a nearby car. \\nThe teen had to hold the sign up for so long, in fact, that local resident, Krista Wilson, called the police to complain about possible child abuse : \\nWilson also stated that as people drove by the teen, she could see \"tears running down her face,” while “grown men were reading it [the sign] and laughing.” \\nWilson wasn\\'t the only person who complained. \\nA witness snapped a photo of the girl then posted it to a Facebook news page and, in no time, it received countless views and comments. \\nMany were completely outraged by the parents\\' actions: \\n“This is so horrific! That poor little girl; she is 13! This is NOT the way to teach a child appropriate behaviour. She is a product of a hyper-sexual culture and doesn\\'t deserve public humiliation like this. I\\'d be surprised if this doesn\\'t contribute to actual trauma.” \\nWhile another wrote: \\n“It certainly was a teachable moment, instead her so called parents have shamed her. 13 is such an impressionable age for self esteem and the like. Way to go crappy parents ????” \\nOne commenter simply said: \\n“Exploitation and abuse.” \\nOn the other hand, there were those who defended the mother\\'s punishment, stating that something worse could have happened if the child\\'s sexting continued: \\n“I\\'m with the mom! Great job all the people who say oh it\\'s bullying and etc etc get over it! This girl was being taught a lesson. Most parents don\\'t give two shits these days what their kids are doing. I don\\'t care about all the haters either. GOOD JOB MOM!!! Keep up the good work.” \\nAnother supporter of the parents\\' decision said: \\n“Stop judging the parents, they are doing what they feel is the best course of action given the situation! If the teenager wasn\\'t embarrassed to show her body and ask for the same in return, than she shouldn\\'t be embarrassed for the punishment her parents gave her either!” \\nAnother suggested this could have been the last straw for the parents: \\n“Maybe the parents tried a different approach and Lil kid tryna to be grown didn\\'t learn so now shes learned the hard, embarrassing way.” \\nDuring the incident, police did arrive on scene to assess the situation. \\nThey spoke to the mother and concluded that the punishment, while extreme, was not enough to warrant child abuse charges. \\nSo far, no legal action has been taken against the mother. However, it has been reported that a social worker would be contacting the mother to help her with parenting strategies. '],\n",

       "  'BREAKING! NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case…Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times…Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince \\nPrince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s email server last week. \\n“Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,” Prince claimed. \\n“They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,” he said. \\n“The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation and you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments,’” Prince explained. \\n“I believe – I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York – the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they’ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That’s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,” Prince said. \\n“There’s five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,” Prince declared. \\nMarlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. \\n“NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,” Prince elaborated. “Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife – the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years – have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have – they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton’s own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.” \\n“So NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn’t,” Prince contended. \\n“There is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they’ve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,” he stated. \\n“So the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs – that’s the level just below commissioner – he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,” Prince said. \\nHe noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, “but they can’t convene a grand jury. They can’t file charges.” \\n“The prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,” he explained. “Now, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, he’s a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.” \\nMarlow agreed that Bharara’s “sterling reputation” as a determined prosecutor was “bad news for the Clintons.” \\nPrince agreed, but said, “If people are willing to bend or break the law and don’t really care about the Constitution or due process – if you’re willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone – who knows what level of pressure” could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? \\nListen to interview here: \\n“The point being, fortunately, it’s not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,” Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has “exposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department” against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to “keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.” \\n“The Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,” he warned. \\nAs for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that “de Blasio wants to stay away from this.” \\n“The evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,” he said. \\nFor entire story: Breitbart News 14.7K shares '],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nOn November, 8, 2016, every pissed off white guy and, as it turns out, plenty of pissed off white women, showed up to the polls and voted for the now President-elect of the United States, Donald J. Trump. \\nThat’s right: The Donald – sexual predator, sociopath, disgraced businessman, reality TV star and all around huckster – is now the most powerful man in the world (insofar as any individual can wield power within extremely complex systems and institutions). \\nNevertheless, President Trump now presides over the largest military empire and the richest nation in the history of the world. \\n*** \\nI was wrong. Hell, almost everyone was wrong, except my Mom, whose street smarts outperformed Nate Silver’s algorithms. Looking back, I should’ve known better and trusted my instincts. After all, I live in Michigan City, Indiana, located in the heart of America’s Rust Belt – the region that gave the world President Trump. \\nI grew up with Trump supporters. Many of my neighbors are Trump supporters. Most of my father’s friends are Trump supporters. And half of my extended family voted for Trump. In many ways, I should be a Trump supporter: I’m White, male, a high school graduate (never finished college) and a Marine Corps veteran. \\nThankfully, I found good books, good music and good drugs at 19 years old. Otherwise, who knows? I could’ve ended up at a Trump rally, punching protesters and acting like a jackbooted thug. Instead, I find myself firmly planted on the left, wondering how we can reach out to portions of Trump’s base. \\n*** \\nIn the age of social media, conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods often drown out rational debate and facts. FoxNews, AM Radio and the Alt-Right media have poisoned the well. In the process, they’ve bamboozled large segments of White America – both young and old. \\nThanks to alternative news sources such as Breitbart and Alex Jones, tens of millions of Americans are being exposed to a quasi-Libertarian/Alt-Right ideology at a staggering pace. Breaking this web of propaganda will be an enormous task, but a necessary one. Here, existing alternative media outlets will be essential. \\nIf we’re interested in exposing more working class and poor white Americans to leftwing ideas and radical politics, we’ll need to write and speak in a way that regular people can understand. In the real world, no one gives a fuck how smart you sound. In fact, I would argue that’s one of the reasons some of Trump’s supporters resent the MSNBC-Yuppie-Liberal-types: they come off as smug assholes. \\n*** \\nSpeaking of smug assholes, we can thank Rachel Maddow, the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN for Trump’s victory. The only thing more precious than their hubris and utter lack of journalistic integrity is their willingness to normalize a sexual predator and neofascist as president. If there’s any silver lining to this election, it’s that the liberal media has been exposed as the propaganda wing of the DNC. \\nNot only did they destroy Bernie’s chances (if he ever had any to begin with), they then tried to shove a neoliberal-hawk down our throats. But people didn’t buy it, especially black and brown people. \\n*** \\nAs we speak, tends of thousands of Americans are taking to the street to protest Trump and White Supremacy. While I wholeheartedly encourage and support those who are protesting, would Hillary have enjoyed such a reception from the left? Doubtful. \\nAnd where have the protests been for the last eight years of Obama’s drone wars and capitulation to Wall Street? Where was the outrage as Obama deported more immigrants in his first four years than Bush deported in his entire eight? \\nYes, let’s protest. But let’s be more principled and sophisticated than we were during the Bush years. If 2020 or 2024 ends with another Obama, we’ve failed. In order for this not to happen, we’ll need to constantly reexamine what we’re doing, and why. \\n*** \\nAnd this brings us to Veterans Day, one of the most hollow and absurd holidays in American society. Unless you have stock in Lockheed Martin or Goldman Sachs, there’s really no reason to thank me for my “service.” We destroyed Iraq and killed innocent people. We mutilated dead bodies and tortured prisoners. And we did it all for geopolitical and corporate interests. \\nSome studies suggest over 1,000,000 Iraqis have died as a result of America’s illegal and immoral war. The war in Iraq has also given the world ISIS. The war in Iraq destabilized an entire region of the planet (something conveniently forgotten by most Americans as they contemplate No Fly Zones in Syria). The war in Iraq has resulted in thousands of veterans suicides (22 a day). More marines from my platoon have killed themselves since returning home than died overseas. \\nBut vets get to go home, at least most of them. The Iraqis have to live with the legacy of Uncle Sam’s madness for the rest of their lives. Everyone had better think about what all of this means as President-Elect Donald J. Trump, a man who openly mocked a Purple Heart recipient and joked about using nuclear weapons, takes office. Related '],\n",

       " ['The Yellow Brick Road to Extinction - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nPerhaps you’ve read about how the Hillary Clinton campaign had a strategy to elevate Donald Trump to the status of what they called a Pied Piper candidate. Rather than the Pied Piper, however, it seems that Trump is closer to another fictional figure. Portrayed by the media for years as a wizard of business, like the media-amplified conman in the L. Frank Baum classic, Trump (as both Clinton and Margaret Atwood have recently pointed out) is more like the Wizard of Oz. \\nIf Trump is the Wizard, however, who is Hillary? The Wicked Witch? Rather than reproducing sexist cliches, perhaps it’s more fair to cast Clintonism, the Democratic Party, or neoliberalism in toto, as the Witch. And the witch is dead. Ding dong. And (though less visible than the daily anti-Trump demonstrations breaking out across the country) throughout the land the little people are celebrating. \\nThey’re celebrating because the ideology that ushered in and maintained wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere, outsourced jobs, spread unemployment and precarious work along with trade deals like NAFTA seems to have been finally put to rest. The crime bills, the surveillance state, the bailouts of banks, the mass incarceration, the austerity and privatization, the stagnation of wages, accompanied by increases in student loan and consumer debt – all capped off by the insult of Obamacare (aka Romneycare), which has done much to enrich the wealthy and further impoverish the little people – all this, it seems, has been halted. But, as in Oz, things are rarely as they appear. And while the Munchkins – and Mnuchins – and others are exulting in the political death of Clintonism, many more see little to celebrate, and much to dread. For though the Witch may be dead, and the staving off of war with Russia and the killing of the TPP are victories for the little people of the planet, the enemy of one’s enemy isn’t necessarily one’s friend. The promises of further deregulation, school privatization, environmental degradation, and tax cuts for the rich made by Trump are hardly victories for the little people, and neither are the racist and xenophobic policies of the Alt-Right (aka white nationalism) taking over the Executive Branch of the United States government. Marking a fundamental departure from post-War norms, the explicitly racist – and implicitly genocidal – goals of Trump and Co. augur persecution, repression, and catastrophe. \\nHyperbole you say? Exaggeration?Many will no doubt respond that people have been crying wolf for years about anti-semitism and racism. Anyone sufficiently critical of Israel’s policies toward Palestinians, for instance, is labeled and libeled as an anti-Semite. Even Jews who are critical of Israel, like Noam Chomsky, are branded this way. As such, it’s entirely understandable that people should be skeptical about reports concerning the anti-Semitism and racism of Donald Trump and his inner-circle. And yet, there’s a profound difference between honest skepticism and dishonest skepticism; and anyone who examines Trump’s history will see that he has practiced various forms of racist discrimination and scapegoating for decades. Among others, Trump’s chief strategist supports anti-Semites and racists. And the only problem that Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for Attorney General, has with the KKK is that some of them smoke pot. (Moreover, let’s not fail to recall the fact that the point of the story of the boy who cried wolf is that the wolf did eventually come.) \\nWhether wolf or wizard, Trump’s history of discrimination is not only old news, it sheds much light on his appointment of Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist. Bannon’s tenure at Breitbart (an Alt-Right, i.e. white nationalist organization) led to stories promoting the most stereotypically racist tropes against women, blacks, Jews, Muslims, Mexicans, and others. And now this proponent of Alt-Right/white supremacy is in charge of strategizing the implementation of policies that include the deportation of millions of immigrants, and banning Muslims – longstanding white nationalist goals of forcible deportation that don’t merely violate basic principles of religious tolerance and respect for human rights; they violate the 1st Amendment, the 4th Amendment, the 14th Amendment, and others. In other words, Trump’s policies baldly contradict the executive’s oath to uphold the constitution. With Trump, such contradictions abound. \\nTrump says, for instance, that he won’t undermine rights recently attained by gays and lesbians. That’s settled law, he says, referring to the Court’s recent recognition of marriage equality. It’s been decided by the Supreme Court, he announces. In the next breath, however, he promises to overturn Roe v Wade, which was also settled by the Supreme Court. It’s even more well-settled. These contradictions hardly cancel one another out. \\nHis invective against Muslims, immigrants, and others has already incited violence, emboldening many to attack blacks, Muslims, Latinos, Jews, and other scapegoats. Displacing the generalized anxieties and violence of the capitalist system, hundreds of such attacks have been reported since the election. \\nThis isn’t, of course, to suggest that Trump won the election solely because of racism, or that his supporters are mostly racists and sexists, as Clinton and her supporters contend. As many have pointed out, Trump won states – like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida – that Obama won just a few years ago. His success is attributable to the fact that people were disgusted by the historically unlikable Hillary Clinton and her poverty-spreading neoliberal politics. \\nLike the Wizard of Oz, an illusion projected onto a screen, the con man (who just settled a fraud suit stemming from his phony university for $25 million) fooled a nation. No one’s really sure what he thinks. Trickery and spectacle, he mesmerized the media for months and months with his outrageousness – his ridiculous hair distracting people the way the lure-like growths on the heads of anglerfish fool their prey. Spouting outlandish statements, he cast his spell. And the plutocrat Hillary and her ideologically-blinded cohorts, believing (like George W. Bush apropos Iraq) that victory would be a cakewalk, stumbled into defeat. \\nIn spite of her arrogant stupidity, however (her cheating, her contempt for the constituency she needed to win, her choice of Tim Kaine for VP, etc.), we shouldn’t overlook the fact that Trump only won because of an undemocratic technicality. Though he prevailed in the electoral college, he lost the popular vote. As such, though Trump may enjoy a legal victory, his wasn’t a moral one. In many respects his victory is entirely immoral – stemming both from his pledges to promote torture, and other crimes, as well as from the US Constitution’s anti-democratic electoral college. Like the Constitution in general, the electoral college was designed to minimize popular rule by aggrandizing the power of a minority of plantation owners. (Concerned that the North was growing more populous than the South, and that popular elections would diminish their power, slaveowners ratified the Constitution only because it included the electoral system, which counted slaves as 3/5 of a person for the sake of apportioning representatives and electors, and thereby heightened their power and secured their privileges.) \\nHad this institution been extricated from the USA’s legal structure, well, it’s hard to imagine that things would be less undemocratic today. As it stands, though, the electoral college illustrates the degree to which the USA remains little more than an insufficiently-reformed slave state. And here we are, like Dorothy, wondering how to get home. \\nDorothy, of course, was not alone in Oz. She was aided by, among others, the Scarecrow. Too dumb to recognize that capitalism and democracy are antithetical, is the Scarecrow Paul Krugman? Or is it Nate Silver, and other pollsters, who unwittingly abetted the despised celebrity billionaire’s victory (and the equally despised former Secretary of State’s defeat)? \\nOne thing’s for sure, if Trump is the Wizard, and the Democratic Party is the Witch, then Bernie Sanders – who turned on his supporters and supported Clinton – is the Cowardly Lion. And yet, the Cowardly Lion would ultimately develop courage. So, maybe there’s still hope for Bernie. As opposed to many Democrats suggesting we give Trump a chance, Sanders has been speaking out against his repressive designs. \\nPraised by recently hostile Republicans (and by that other notorious wizard, the former Grand Wizard of the KKK, David Duke), Trump has also had a friendly meeting with Obama since winning. It seems the last thing Obama wants is to undermine the peaceful transition of power (even if it’s the power of a white supremacist state – which, after all, the USA has been for most of its history). \\nNotwithstanding the thoroughly racist history of the US, however, it is still more than a little alarming to see white supremacists preparing to set up shop in the White House. And it must prompt us to wonder: what will happen if the system fails to constrain Donald Trump? Thanks to Bush and Obama, Republicans and Democrats, he has an unprecedentedly powerful national security state at his command. And, on the other hand, what if the system succeeds, and prevents Trump from pursuing his infrastructure-building project, his trade re-negotiations, and his easing of relations with Russia, which frighten the military-industrial complex and other aspects of the system more than the more xenophobic aspects of his agenda? \\nIf Trump is constrained from pursuing his plans, then what? It isn’t difficult to imagine Trump continuing Obama’s policy of mass deportation. Unlike Obama, though, who’s successfully hidden his policy of deporting millions from the public, one can easily see Trump taking credit for this, satisfying some of his base this way. And let’s not forget, though Trump raises fears about creating registries for Muslims, to some degree registry databases for Muslims already exist. No fly lists are just one part of this. And police surveillance of Muslim communities, in mosques and schools, has been widely known and tolerated since 9/11. Trump could simply continue these as well. \\nAll of which is to say, as repression in Standing Rock and other places continues and a deteriorating environment, toothless climate accords, and unabated economic inequality demonstrate, for most people conditions are already intolerable. Even if Trump is prevented from following through on his promises of ethnically cleansing the US, Trump’s position concerning global warming has genocidal implications of its own. Promising to only intensify the poverty, insecurity, violence, and ecological degradation produced by a political-economic system that’s based on the exploitation of the planet and its people, Trump, and the system that produced him, must both be stopped. \\nOf course, an opposition that merely aims to stop Trump will at best succeed in slowing him down. To prevail, an opposition must forcefully push in the opposite direction – toward universal health care, toward an expansion of the public realm as opposed to privatization, toward an aggressive prioritization of rights to water, housing, education, healthy food, a clean environment, and other requirements for human and environmental health, over the demands of profit. And, like other rights are said to be, these rights must be inalienable – not for sale – beyond the market. This should be the goal, the creation of an actually democratic system – an economic as well as a political democracy. \\nBeyond rhetoric, for an opposition to prevail it must not simply proclaim that Trump is “not my president.” It must recognize that Trump (and the system itself) lacks legitimacy. This is not simply because Trump’s opponent obtained over a million more votes than he did, but because Trump promises to violate the very principles that (however much they’ve fallen short historically) justify the United States’ existence in the first place. \\nBeyond Trump, however, the biophagous political-economic system that enabled him to attain so much power must be rejected as well. As the ancient legal maxim has it, the health of the people should be the supreme law. And, because the current global system has spread, and is designed to continue to spread, conditions of disease throughout the world, the entire system is in breach. Related '],\n",
       " ['This is no time for unity -- Trump must be confronted with relentless protest',\n",
       "  'November 9, 2016 \\nCalls for unity behind a Donald Trump administration are irresponsible, dangerous, and must be rejected. \\nIn her concession speech this morning, Hillary Clinton told a stunned nation the following: “Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country… I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.” \\n“We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead,” she added. \\nMany of Clinton’s most fervent supporters were rightly taken aback. After all, these words came from someone who only days earlier was denouncing Trump as a violent misogynist , a racist and Islamophobe, and a would-be dictator unfit to lead, too emotionally unstable to trusted with the country’s nuclear codes. Liberals who had seen in Clinton a last line of defense against the aggressive right were now witnessing her rebrand him as somehow worthy of the presidency. \\nThat Clinton would overlook Trump’s history of sexual assault may be no surprise, given her role in covering-up her own husband’s behavior. That she would overlook his blatant appeals to white nationalism and Islamophobia is similarly unsurprising given her own rhetoric about Black “superpredators” and hawkish interventionism in the Middle East. \\nBut still, this was a campaign consciously designed around stoking the fear that Trump was unlike any other candidate, an abnormally pernicious threat to women, people of color, and even democracy itself. The strategy failed spectacularly, and Clinton’s about-face was predictable if no less spectacular. \\nMeanwhile, Trump was suddenly sounding presidential, insisting in his victory speech that “Now it’s time to bind the wounds of division… to come together as one united people.” Even his exuberant supporters, who had only an hour before been chanting “Lock her up!” must have been shocked to hear him insist that Clinton is owed “a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.” \\nFor those who have long dismissed the two-party system as a farce, this shared rhetoric by the two candidates wouldn’t be surprising. In a phrase that has become the fodder for memes, superimposed over images of the smiling Clintons and Trumps or Michelle Obama hugging George W. Bush , the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci once argued that “The historical unity of the ruling classes is realized in the state.” \\nBut despite this unity among elites, Trump has mobilized and encouraged a ferociously white supremacist movement , and this base won’t go away quietly. \\nWhen Clinton wishes him a “successful” presidency, what does this mean? Successfully building a wall along the southern border? Successfully rolling back what little protections exist for people of color, queer and trans people, and women? No, we wish no success for Trump. \\nAs Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author of From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation , put it this morning: “No, we don’t owe this monster an open mind… Trump deserves revulsion and relentless protest. After a year of calling this man a fascist and a unique evil, they tell us to unite and give him a chance… No one is interested in unifying with this garbage; we have to confront this racism and sexism in the streets and organize like we never have before.” \\nClinton is no ally of the left: her record of support for mass incarceration, neoliberalism, and brutal wars and coups abroad makes this perfectly clear. We don’t owe Trump “an open mind and a chance to lead.” We owe him nothing but our ferocious opposition in the streets, and that starts today. \\n\\nGeorge Ciccariello-Maher is an organizer, radical political theorist, and professor at Drexel University.

       " ['Trump whistles his dogs | Intrepid Report.com',\n",
       "  'Posted on November 4, 2016 by Gilad Atzmon \\nIn her recent Washington Post Article , Jewish academic Cheryl Greenberg makes one valid observation. Trump’s criticism of the Jews is far more subtle than his disapproval of other groups and identities (Mexicans, Muslims, Women etc). Though Trump is not known for pulling his punches, when it comes to the Jews, Trump chooses his words very carefully. Trump, according to Greenberg, is so careful “that it’s not clear that Trump himself fully understands the implications of what he’s saying.” I guess that the Jewish academic couldn’t restrain herself from looking down at the Goy candidate. \\nGreenberg sees Trump as a puppet-master who controls his audience by means of ‘dog whistling.’ “Trump’s references to money, bankers and international conspiracies appear to be deliberate anti-Semitic dog whistles, and his alt-right supporters recognize (and celebrate) that.” \\nGreenberg elaborates on her observation, “first of all, dog whistles serve when overt expressions are not an option; they communicate to those who are familiar with the conspiracy theories but maintain plausible deniability.” According to Greenberg, when Trump wants to communicate a message about the Jews, he uses an indecipherable code intelligible only to half of the Americans . . . Greenberg and the ADL. \\nIf Greenberg is correct, if Trump says ‘international Bankers’ but really means Jews, then both the Republican candidate and half of the American people are fearful of the Jews. They must very well understand what a confrontation with Jewish institutions may entail. They know that, in America, criticism of Mexicans, Women, and Muslims is a kosher territory but even a subtle criticism of Jews may cost them dearly. One may wonder, how did this happen? What is the substance of that magical power that empowers half of Americans to speak in codes when they think about Jews? \\nGreenberg seems to raise the right question just to come up with the wrong answer. “Why would anti-Semitism not be an overt option, while racism, sexism, and xenophobia are?” \\n“Americans are less willing to accept blatant anti-Semitism than racism,” Greenberg’s answers. \\nWhat Greenberg really wants to say is that Americans can be racists and can say whatever they like about whoever they want. But when it comes to Jews, they refrain. Americans do know very well the geography of the boundaries of correctness. Jewish power is for them a taboo, at least momentarily. America and Americans are fully aware of the enormous power that is bestowed in the hands of just a few Jewish oligarchs within the ubiquitous industries of media, finance, politics, and culture. \\nAmerica would have loved to dissolve the situation peacefully but it can’t. Jewish power can’t be contained or suppressed because we are not even allowed to allude to it, let alone point it out. \\nJewish power is defined as the power to silence criticism of Jewish power. Jewish power, as such, is a ticking time bomb. It is a unique form of self-destructiveness. The history of the Jews proves this point. Time after time it is Jewish power that sets the path towards a glamorous Jewish golden age that leads to the most severe tragic consequences. \\nThe Jewish phobia of anti-Semitism is not driven by fear of the gentile. It is actually the other way around. The Jewish fear of anti-Semitism is the result of Jews being fearful of their own might. Jews tend to recognise that there is something in themselves that evokes animosity from others. This is the true meaning of the Jewish “Pre Traumatic Stress Syndrome.” It is the acceptance that from here forward, things can only get worse. Many Jews see in Trump’s popularity a symptom of a fatigue of their own power. They interpret the nostalgic yearning for ‘America being great’ as a pining for a Christian past. Something that predates Goldman Sachs’ and Soros’ dominion. The Jewish aggression towards Trump can be realised as an expression of Jewish guilt. Yet, Trump himself has very little to do with it. He married his daughter to a Jew. He trades with Jews, he loves Israel. He is almost as Jewish as the Clintons. \\nGreenberg is optimistic. For her, Trump’s popularity is “the final gasping of white supremacy.” His voters—pretty much half of the American people—are dogs reacting to a man with a whistle. I am not as optimistic as Greenberg. I think that exploring such contempt towards half of the American people in the name of a vague progressive mantra is a very dangerous game. It suggests to me that progressives have reached a state of complete detachment. \\nGilad Atzmon is an Israeli jazz musician, author and political activist.

       "  ' \\x93Confronting China\\x94 By John Pilger\\n TJC: Please tell us about your new film, The Coming War on China .\\nJP: The Coming War on China is my 60th film and perhaps one of the most urgent. It continues the theme of illuminating the imposition of great power behind a facade of propaganda as news. In 2011, President Obama announced a \\x91pivot to Asia\\x92 of US forces: almost two-thirds of American naval power would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific by 2020.\\nThe undeclared rationale for this was the \\x91threat\\x92 from China, by some measure now the greatest economic power. The Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, says US policy is to confront those \\x91who see America\\x92s dominance and want to take that away from us\\x92.\\nThe film examines power in both countries and how nuclear weapons, in American eyes, are the bedrock of its dominance. In its first \\x91chapter\\x92, the film reveals how most of the population of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific were unwittingly made into nuclear guinea pigs in a programme whose secrets \\x96 and astonishing archive \\x96 are related to the presence of a missile base now targeting China. The Coming War on China will be released in cinemas in the UK on December 1st and broadcast on ITV (in the UK) on December 6th.\\nTJC: How do you assess Australia\\x92s role in America\\x92s \\x91Pivot to Asia\\x92?\\nJP: Australia is virtually the 51st state of the US. Although China is Australia\\x92s biggest trader, on which much of the national economy relies, \\x91confronting China\\x92 is the diktat from Washington. The Australian political establishment, especially the military and intelligence agencies, are fully integrated into what is known as the \\x91alliance\\x92, along with the dominant Murdoch media. I often feel a certain sadness about the way my own country \\x96 with all its resources and opportunities \\x96 seems locked into such an unnecessary, dangerous obsequious role in the world. If the \\x91pivot\\x92 proceeds, Australia could find itself fighting, yet again, a great power\\x92s war.\\nTJC: With regards to the British and American media, how can the US get away with selling China as a threat when it is encircling China?\\nJP: That\\x92s a question that goes to the heart of modern-day propaganda. China is encircled by a \\x91noose\\x92 of some 400 US bases, yet the news has ignored this while concentrating on the \\x91threat\\x92 of China building airstrips on disputed islets in the South China Sea, clearly as a defence to a US Navy blockade.\\nTJC: Obama\\x92s visit to Japan, and particularly to Hiroshima, was a really cynical act. What was your impression of Japan and the political situation there?\\nJP: Japan is an American colony in all but name \\x96 certainly in terms of its relationship with the rest of the world and especially China. The historian Bruce Cumings explores this in an interview in the film. Within the constraints of American dominance, indeed undeterred by Washington, Japan\\x92s current prime minister Shinzo Abe has developed an extreme nationalist position, in which contrition for Japanese actions in the Second World War is anathema and the post-war \\x91peace constitution\\x92 is likely to be changed.\\nAbe has gone as far as boasting that Japan will use nuclear weapons if it wants. In any US conflict with China, Japan \\x96 which last year announced its biggest ever \\x91defence\\x92 budget \\x96 would play a critical role. There are 32 US military installations on the Japanese island of Okinawa, facing China. However, there is a sense in modern Asia that power in the world has indeed moved east and peaceful \\x91Asian solutions\\x92 to regional animosities are possible.\\nTJC: Do you think the new trade and investment deals like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and especially the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) will affect China\\x92s business operations?\\nJP: It\\x92s difficult to say, but I doubt it. What is remarkable about the rise of China is the way it has built, almost in the blink of an eye, a trade, investment and banking structure that rivals that of the Bretton Woods institutions. Unknown to many of us, China is developing its \\x91New Silk Road\\x92 to Europe at an astonishing pace. China\\x92s response to threats from Washington is a diplomacy that\\x92s tied to this development, and which includes a burgeoning alliance with Russia.\\nT.J.

       " ['Scandal in Korea, the Masses Descend to the Streets | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Country: South Korea We are continuing to inform our readers on the scandal around Choi Sung-sil – confidante of President Park Geun-hye , as the crisis caused by her interference in the affairs of the state and linked to corruption continues to roll on. To recap, Choi Sung-sil had no official right to do so but had access to and read official materials, corrected the President’s speeches (though there is still no evidence of an ideological (rather than stylistic) nature of the corrections) and is suspected to have raised funds from major companies, including Lotte and SK Group, for MIR and K-Sports Foundations related to her. On November 4, 2016 the South Korean President appeared on live TV and apologized, admitting that “over-reliance on Choi Sung-sil had blinded my objectivity and allowed my guard to drop”. She spoke with great emotion, which is unusual for her, took full responsibility for the scandal and said that she was very sorry that she had disappointed the people who had entrusted her with the right to rule the state. Park said that she had been working on improving the economy and living standards, but some individuals had been acting illegally in their own interests, about which she is deeply concerned. Her emotional reaction is reasonable. Looking into her biography – after her parents’ death and against the background of very difficult relationship with her family, Choi Sung-sil, the daughter of her spiritual advisor, was her closest friend and a companion-in-arms for a very long time. The President emphasized that she was ready to accept all the demands of the population and the National Assembly in the course of performing her duties. This includes, if necessary, rendering assistance to the prosecutor’s office investigation and taking part in the special investigation, although formally she could legitimately refuse to do so. However, Park Geun-hye noted that the country’s security and economics are currently under great threat. Therefore, it is impermissible for the implementation of state policy to be halted. However, the president’s apologies have not gone down well with everyone. The (incumbent) Saenuri Party received the President’s speech quite positively, stating that the President had agreed with all the public demands and had expressed a firm commitment to clarify all the details of the scandal and prevent similar situations in the future. The head of the opposition Toburo Democratic Party, Choo Mi-ae, on the contrary, said that the apologies of Park Geun-hye did not provide any answers, which the outraged people were waiting for, and called the President’s speech “mere disingenuous apologies”. The Chairman of the Interim Committee of the People’s Party, Pak Chi-wong, pointed out the unacceptability of Park Geun-hye’s statements that the Choi Sung-sil matter had its roots in actions aimed at improving the economy and living standards of the population, but praised the willingness of Park Geun-hye to cooperate with the prosecutor’s office in the investigation. As a result, the opposition only increased its pressure and actually presented an ultimatum to the President – either the Parliament initiates impeachment or Park steps down from domestic politics and removes the Prime Minister newly appointed by her. He is a representative of the Left, but not the one who would satisfy the opposition leaders. This demands are all backed up by the disgruntled general public. On November 5, there was a candle-lit demonstration in Seoul, which according to official data was attended by 45 thousand people. According to the data of the opposition – attendance reached 100 thousand (some even mentioned two hundred thousand, but this is an obvious exaggeration). There were no outright confrontations. The police (about 20 thousand officers in 220 cars) behaved appropriately, but on November 12 protests recurred. How is the investigation going in the meantime? On November 3, Choi Sung-sil was detained in custody, but WITHOUT being charged. This is a practice in the Republic of Korea (which has been repeatedly criticized by human rights activists). It is permitted to hold persons in custody for up to 20 days even if there is not enough evidence to press charges against them. The decision to hold Choi was made by the Seoul Central District Court at the request of the prosecutor’s office. On the same day, another person involved in the corruption scandal – the former senior advisor for policy, Ahn Jong-beom,, said during interrogation that the MIR and K-Sports Foundations (the subject of the investigation) were established under the orders of President Park Geun-hye, which could explain how quickly they were officially registered. Ahn Jong-beom, stated, that in her policy the head of the state pays great attention to culture and the creative economy, and rejected suspicions of her involvement in fund-raising from large companies to aid the aforementioned foundations. He said that representatives of the business community were under no pressure and voluntarily decided to participate in the establishment of the foundations. The Former Secretary of the President of the Republic of Korea for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo has also been summoned for questioning by the prosecutor’s office. He is suspected of involvement in fund-raising from companies for MIR and K-Sports foundations, and will be questioned as a witness, although (depending on the investigation results) he may become a suspect. There are suspicions (as yet unproven) that he spent the funds of the foundations for personal use, registered property belonging to his wife to a fraudulent third party and used his influence to help his son complete compulsory military service in the police as opposed to the armed forces. In general, there is no convincing evidence of material cases of corruption or interference in the affairs of the state yet – there is only “reasonable suspicion” or rumours running rife in the left-wing and right-wing media. There is no evidence of ideological corrections to the presidential speeches yet, neither are there any statements by representatives of the FIG concerning the fact that they were forced to sponsor the foundations against their will and there are no financial documents confirming the transfer of funds to the personal accounts of Choi Sung-sil. However, it seems that they are trying to hang all recent scandals and abuses of power on the friend of the President. While a document from WikiLeaks saying that “there are rumours that Park is overly dependent on a person who can be compared with Rasputin”, is quoted not as reference to rumours, but as a proof of some kind. Park has not given in to pressure (many thought that her TV appearance would be more than an apology and saw her voluntary retirement as well) and remains under fire – the left will try not to miss a chance to dethrone a “symbol of dictatorship”, guilty at least of being the daughter of Pak Chung-hee. For the right, this is not only a chance to drown their opponent in the factional struggle, but also blame the “shaman” (as a scapegoat) for all the failures of government policy, and then, after cutting ties with her, try and enter a new round of the presidential race with a new image. It is the conservatives who can remind her of the resumption of the fight against corruption and the Eurasian Initiative, with which she tried to at least partially get out from under American influence and improve relations with Moscow and Beijing. It is no coincidence that the former leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, Kim Moo-song (a strict conservative, far more to the right than the President) demanded that the President leave the party. He stressed that the head of the state, as the guarantor of the Constitution, was ruling the country, violating the constitutional principles and values, and demanded the formation of a national unity government within the shortest possible time. The members of the Supreme Council of the party protested against such a demand, but its leader, Lee Jong-hyun (ex-supporter of Park), announced that he would soon step down. He only asked for a little time to help the head of the state to deal with the situation. In this context, it’s important to remember that the Park Geun-hye’s “lean to the right” was not caused by irrational reasons but by the general political situation, which included North Korea’s provocative position (i.e. its fourth nuclear test, which needed a clear response), the categorical rejection by the left of all the president’s actions (which excluded the opportunity of any dialogue for the implementation of a moderate programme) and significant pressure from the right wing. So, let’s wait and see how events will unfold, since according to statements made by government representatives, the authorities will do everything to try and settle the scandal.

       "  'October 28, 2016 112 While the Western press continues scaring its public of \"Russian aggression\" and blaming Russia for influencing the 2016 American presidential elections, Vladimir Putin just made a speech that is unlikely to appear in any mainstream media. Share on Facebook \\nAt the meeting of experts at the Valdai Club in Sochi on October 27, Putin said about the U.S. elections: “a look at various candidates’ platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould – the difference is slight, if there is any.” \\nPutin called U.S. stories of “Russian hacking the U.S. election” as a “mythical and imaginary problem” and “the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election,” instead of focusing on the domestic issues: \\n“The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police. You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.” \\n“Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people’s choice? America is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.” \\nPutin reminded us who the real rulers are: \\n“The expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things – stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones.” \\nReferring to the Western elites’ downplaying the growing gap between rich and poor, Putin said: \\n“It seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favor of the suzerain.” \\nPutin reminded everyone that current situation of instability in the world is a direct result of the choice made by the United States after the end of the Cold War to take “the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.” By taking this course, the U.S. missed a chance to make globalization “more harmonious and sustainable in nature.” \\nIn their euphoria of winning the Cold war, the United States “essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalization and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this.” \\nThis victorious attitude led to the system of international relations where “rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely. “ \\nOn the Western hypocrisy and double talk, Putin said: \\n“If the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules.” \\nRussian president reminded about the U.S.-led decision “to launch airstrikes in the center of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya,” and turning the UN into a tool of U.S. foreign policy: \\n“The operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favor these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defense systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos.” \\nIn the global economy, multilateral institutions also became a tool to promote the interests of few: \\n“We see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organization and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organization itself aside and build a new one instead.” \\nAlways referring to the U.S. as “some of our partners,” Putin stressed that they “demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today.” Instead of making OSCE, “a crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security,” it was shaped into “an instrument in the service of someone’s foreign policy interests.” \\nAbout constant vilification of Russia and trumpeting of “Russian aggression,” Putin said: “they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‘Russian military threat’. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower’s interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders. \\nOf course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilization against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. \\nIt is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims. \\nThe question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world?’ '],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\n[embedded content] \\n“I ask in the framework of the Ukrainian legislation to deal with those criminals who have today blocked the work of the court. Those who did it are criminally liable. I am interested in establishing the truth and on Monday [28.11.16] it definitely will be,” said Yanukovych. The questioning of the ex-President Viktor Yanukovych can’t start due to the fact that ex- “Berkut officers” cannot be brought to Svyatoshinsky court. Their departure from the Lukyanovsky detention center was blocked by radicals of Right Sector. \\nToday the questioning of ex-President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych via videoconference in the Svyatoshinsky district court of Kiev was to be held. However, several dozen radicals blocked the exit of Lukyanovsky jail, thus, the former “Berkut officers” could not be brought to Svyatoshinsky court. \\nNote that the building of the Svyatoshinsky district court of Kiev is guarded today by 130 police officers. \\nAs a reminder, Yanukovych’s interrogation takes place in the framework of the case of five former employees of the “Berkut” special forces. The ex-President of Ukraine is present as a witness. \\nOver the years, such a quantity of videos have been published that the question of who was shooting is no longer rhetorical. “Berkut” was accused of aggressiveness on Maidan, but the soldiers of these special forces became the first victims. The resident of Lvov Ivan Bubenchik is not even hiding, but rather willingly gives interviews in which he brags about being the first who opened fire on the officers on Maidan. \\n“At first, I eliminated officers. Two. And then I didn’t do anything to the soldiers, I just wounded one in the leg,” said Bubenchik. \\n[embedded content] \\nHowever, somehow it is not him who is on trial, but five fighters of “Berkut” . Investigators allegedly found involvement of the Kiev special “Berkut” units in the murders of 48 members of Maidan and the gunshot wounds of another 80 protesters on February 20th, 2014, on Instytutska street. As a result of the investigation into 25 employees of the special forces and the leadership of the “Berkut” regiment it was reported about the suspicion of involvement in these events, and from 20 of them on the wanted list, five are in custody. \\nEarlier it was reported that the scandalous lawyer Mark Feygin had invented how it’s possible to use the video conference questioning of ex-President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. Parubiy demands the return of Yanukovych to Ukrainian territory \\nSpeaker of Parliament Andriy Parubiy urged the Ukrainian investigators to read out the charges during the video interrogation former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. \\n“I think the most important thing that needs to be done by the Ukrainian investigators is to read out the charges against Yanukovych,” he declared to journalists of local media. After this, according to him, Kiev authorities will “continue to work” . In addition, Parubiy stated that it is precisely Yanukovych who is responsible for “what was on Maidan, and what was after Maidan” . \\nThe speaker of the Rada also believes that Kiev should demand the return of the former President to Ukraine. For this purpose, as Parubiy said, it is necessary to use every opportunity. Copyright © 2016. All Rights Reserved. Related '],\n",

       " [\"Who Shouldn't Eat Soy? | NutritionFacts.org\",\n",
       "  'Close Transcript Transcript: Who Shouldn’t Eat Soy? \\nBelow is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. \\nWhen the Women’s Health Initiative study found that menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy suffered “higher rates of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall harm,” a call was made for safer alternatives. Yes, estrogen has positive effects, the Women’s Health Initiative found—such as reducing menopausal symptoms and improving bone health, reducing hip fracture risk; but also negative effects—increasing risk of blood clots in the heart, brain, and lungs, as well as breast cancer. \\nSo, ideally, to get the best of both worlds, we’d need what’s called a selective estrogen receptor modulator, something that has pro-estrogenic effects in some tissues (like bone), but anti-estrogenic effects in other tissues (like the breast). Drug companies are trying to make them, but phytoestrogens—natural compounds in plants, like genistein in soybeans, that are structurally similar to estrogen—appear to function as natural selective estrogen receptor modulators. How could something that looks like estrogen act as an anti-estrogen? \\nThe original theory for how soy phytoestrogens control breast cancer growth is that they compete with our own estrogens for binding to the estrogen receptor. As you drip more and more soy compounds on breast cancer cells in a petri dish, less and less actual estrogen is able to bind to them. So, the estrogen-blocking ability of phytoestrogens can help explain their anti -estrogenic effects. But, how do we then explain their pro -estrogenic effects on other tissues, like bone? How can soy have it both ways? \\nThe mystery was solved when we discovered there are two types of estrogen receptors in the body. And, so, how a target cell responds depends on which type of estrogen receptors they have. This may be “the key to understanding the health-protective potential of soy phytoestrogens”—the existence of this newly discovered estrogen receptor, named estrogen receptor beta, to distinguish it from the classic estrogen receptor alpha. And, unlike our body’s own estrogen, soy phytoestrogens preferentially bind to the beta receptors. \\nIf you have people eat about a cup of cooked whole soybeans, within about eight hours, genistein levels in the blood reach about 20 to 50 nanomoles—that’s how much is circulating throughout our body, bathing our cells. About half is bound up to proteins in the blood; so, the effective concentration is about half that. So, let’s see what that means for estrogen receptor activation. \\nThis is the graph that explains the mysterious health benefits of soy foods. Down around the effective levels you’d get eating a cup of soybeans, there’s very little alpha activation—but, lots of beta activation. So, now let’s look at where each of these receptors are located in the human body. \\nThe way estrogen pills increase the risk of fatal blood clots is by causing the liver to dump out all these extra clotting factors. But, guess what? The human liver only contains alpha estrogen receptors, not beta receptors. And so, maybe, if we ate like 30 cups of soybeans a day, that could be a problem. But, at the kinds of concentrations one would get with just normal soy consumption, no wonder this is a problem with drug estrogens—but not soy phytoestrogens. \\nThe effects on the uterus appear also to be mediated solely by alpha receptors—which is, presumably, why no negative impact has been seen with soy. So, while estrogen-containing drugs may increase the risk of endometrial cancer up to ten-fold, phytoestrogen-containing foods are associated with significantly less endometrial cancer—in fact, protective effects for these types of gynecological cancers, in general. Women who ate the most soy had 30% less endometrial cancer, and appeared to cut their ovarian cancer risk nearly in half. \\nSoy phytoestrogens don’t appear to have any effect on the lining of the uterus, but still can dramatically improve menopausal symptoms. The Kupperman index is like a compilation of all 11 of the most common menopausal symptoms. \\nIn terms of bone health, human bone cells carry beta estrogen receptors. So, we might expect soy phytoestrogens to be protective. And, indeed, they do seem to significantly increase bone mineral density—consistent with population data suggesting “High consumption of soy products is associated with increased bone mass.” But, can they prevent bone loss over time? \\nSoy milk was compared to a transdermal progesterone cream. The control group lost significant bone mineral density in their spine over the two-year study period. But, the progesterone group lost significantly less, and the two glasses of soy milk a day group ended up actually better than when they started. This is probably the most robust study to date, comparing the soy phytoestrogen genistein to a more traditional hormone replacement drug regimen. In the spine, over a year, the placebo group lost bone density, but gained in the phytoestrogen and estrogen groups, and the same with the hip bones. \\nThe study clearly shows that the soy phytoestrogen prevents bone loss, and enhances new bone formation, in turn producing a net gain of bone mass. But, the only reason we care about bone mass is that we want to prevent fractures. Is soy food consumption associated with lower fracture risk? Yes. A significantly lower risk of bone fracture associated with just a single serving of soy a day—the equivalent of 5 to 7 grams of soy protein, or 20 to 30 milligrams of phytoestrogens. So, that’s just like one cup of soy milk—or, even better, a serving of a whole soy food, like tempeh or edamame, or the beans themselves. \\nWe don’t have fracture data on soy supplements, though. So, if we seek the types of health benefits we presume Asian populations get from eating whole and traditional soy foods, maybe we should look to eating those, rather than taking unproven protein powders or pills. \\nIs there anyone who should avoid soy? Well, some people have soy allergies. A national survey found that only about 1 in 2,000 people report a soy allergy. That’s 40 times less than the most common allergen—dairy milk—and about ten times less than all the other common allergens—like fish, eggs, shellfish, nuts, wheat, or peanuts.

       " ['Donald Trump Hit With VERY Shady Voter Intimidation Lawsuit In Arizona (DETAILS)',\n",
       "  '0 1661 \\nDonald Trump wants so-called “poll watchers” to scare people into not voting? Fine, then Arizona Democrats will sue their state GOP’s sorry ass… And they’ve got a good chance of winning. \\nThe U.S. Supreme Court’s gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 was a huge win for the Republican Party. Since high voter turnout — especially high minority voter turnout — creates victories for Democrats, it makes sense for the GOP to keep as many people from voting as they possibly can. There’s just one thing the party of Donald Trump forgot: Voters still do have some rights, and the GOP doesn’t get to do whatever the hell it wants. \\nDonald Trump’s calls for “poll watchers” to prevent nonexistent “voter fraud” may land the Republican Party in some serious hot water. AZ Central reports the Democratic Party of Arizona filed a lawsuit and seeks a court order banning Mein Trumpf’s bands of brown shirts from the polling places. \\n‘The suit filed in federal court in Phoenix Monday seeks an order blocking volunteer GOP poll watchers from harassing or photographing people headed to polling locations. The suit says the state Republican Party is essentially an arm of Trump’s campaign and the campaign and its backers have been organizing “citizen journalists” and “poll watchers” to flood minority-heavy polling sites on Nov. 8.’ \\nAnd despite the demise of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, they’ve still got some ammo. Last week, Rachel Maddow talked about something the GOP forgot about: That pesky old legal consent decree. Back in 1981, the Republican National Committee (RNC) employed similar “poll watcher” tactics during a tight governor race in New Jersey. Their “Ballot Security Task Force” employed heavy-handed tactics in minority districts and won the race for their candidate by a razor thin margin. \\nUnfortunately, the GOP’s short-term win backfired and had long-term consequences: a 35-year consent decree that puts strong limits on their “poll watching” activities. These legal restrictions don’t expire until next year. Naturally, Donald Trump’s renewed call for “poll watchers” has triggered concerns on the part of DNC lawyers at the national level. Now, they’re demanding that the courts extend the consent decree through 2025. Watch: Rachel Maddow explains how Trump’s call for “poll watchers” is causing legal trouble for the RNC. \\nOf course, Tim Sifert, the state’s GOP spokesman, insists these poll watchers aren’t trying to intimidate voters. They’re just helping “monitor” polling places since — thanks to SCOTUS — we no longer have as many actual monitors for U.S. elections. But, as POLITICO points out, there’s a huge difference between having impartial observers around to provide advice and support for voters and poll workers and having “poll watchers” spreading misinformation and scaring voters. \\n‘Trump seems to be advocating for a type of election monitoring that relies on volunteers to use deceptive practices that are often used to prevent people of color from voting. Voter suppression has changed since the era of literacy tests and poll taxes. In 2016, suppression occurs in two distinct stages: one before the election, and one at the polling locations themselves.’ \\nThe POLITICO article explains how the GOP tries to scare people into not voting in two stages. Stage 1: Before an election, Republicans try to keep people from casting their ballots with false — and sometimes scary — information. In 2008, mailers went out telling Democratic voters in Virginia that Election Day had been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday. Meanwhile, black neighborhoods in Milwaukee (2004) and Philadelphia (2008) got plastered with flyers warning that people with unpaid child support and parking tickets might get arrested when they show up to vote. Stage 2: On election day, so-called “poll watchers” — often with fake badges and IDs that make them look like they’re in positions of authority — single out non-white voters with demands for ID and questions about their citizenship. They also often scare off eligible voters by taking photos and video footage (which sounds innocuous unless you happen to be among the roughly 7.5 million people being stalked each year). \\nAnd, let’s not forget — here’s what “poll watchers” looked like during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era.

       " ['Kazakhstan on the Lookout for Nuclear Security | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Central Asia In November 2016, the Majilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan approved the creation of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Low-Enriched Uranium Bank on its territory. Low-enriched uranium (LEU) is a material used for making fuel for nuclear power plants (NPP). The International Atomic Energy Agency decided to create a strategic LEU warehouse in 2006. The project’s aim is to secure an uninterrupted supply of fuel to the NPPs of the IAEA Member States. However, the Bank will not be used for regular LEU supply. This will be an emergency reserve, which will only be used in exceptional circumstances. The IAEA will own the official LEU reserves. It was decided to place the Bank in one of the Agency’s Member States. The location of choice might be a state with no nuclear weapons but with the technologies and infrastructure to work with LEU. In addition, the country should enjoy a good reputation in the IAEA. Kazakhstan complied with all these requirements. The Republic of Kazakhstan is a large-scale producer of uranium with the relevant technologies and experience, which includes processing high-enriched uranium into LEU (which is important for nuclear disarmament). Kazakhstan decided to participate in the development of peaceful atomic energy and filed an application to the IAEA in summer 2011. Kazakhstan proposed two locations for the Bank: a plot at the former Semipalatinsk test site and the Ulba Metallurgical Plant (Ust-Kamenogorsk). After inspection of both sites by the Agency’s experts, the second site was chosen. The Ulba Metallurgical Plant has almost a half a century of experience in working with radioactive materials and high-skilled experts – a legacy of the Soviet school. In addition, the enterprise has been greatly upgraded and it meets the highest safety requirements. In April 2015, a decree of the Kazakhstan Parliament approved a treaty with the IAEA on the creation of the LEU Bank in Kazakhstan. In August 2015, this Treaty was signed by the Foreign Affairs Minister of Kazakhstan Erlan Idrissov and the IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano. The preparation works involving IAEA experts are in full swing. Prior to the placement of the LEU Bank in Kazakhstan, its government will have to improve both the infrastructure and legislation in order to comply with international safety criteria. The foundation has already been laid: the law On the Use of Nuclear Power was adopted in January 2016. IAEA experts participated in the preparation of some amendments to the new law. There is a lot still to be done to make the new warehouse as safe as possible for the local citizens and the environment. All the material will be stored in containers that comply with European standards. According to IAEA data, the uranium reserves will be enough to provide electricity to a big city for 3 years. The IAEA will bear all the expenses related to uranium transportation, taxes, and guarantees in respect of the LEU Bank. Kazakhstan will have to run the warehouse at its own expense – provide it with electricity, pay salaries to the employees (citizens of Kazakhstan), etc. In acknowledgement of the placement and maintenance of the LEU Bank on its territory, Kazakhstan expects that the IAEA will assist it in the development of the nuclear industry. Right now, the IAEA Commission is working in Kazakhstan and conducting general research of the nuclear infrastructure. Upon completion of its work, the Commission will prepare a report with recommendations for the development of Kazakhstan’s nuclear industry. The Republic possesses huge reserves of uranium and ranks first in the world in terms of its production. Uranium from Kazakhstan forms a large part of the world uranium market. Moreover, Kazakhstan has long dreamed of supplying more than just raw materials or semi-finished products to other countries. It hopes to independently carry out all the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle right up to uranium conversion into nuclear fuel for the nuclear power plants. The export of nuclear fuel is greatly more profitable. The President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev mentioned this objective during a meeting with the Chairman of the Board of Kazatomprom Askar Zhumagaliyev that took place in early November 2016. He noted that to reach this goal, Kazakhstan should intensify cooperation with other states and international organizations in the nuclear industry. It should be noted that one of the major partners of Kazakhstan in the nuclear industry is Russia. Owing to its interaction with Russia, Kazakhstan has made progress in the independent production of nuclear fuel. This cooperation continues: in October 2016, Astana hosted the Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum with the participation of the Presidents of the two countries – Vladimir Putin and Nursultan Nazarbayev. As a result, Russia and Kazakhstan adopted a plan of collaboration until 2018 and signed a Memorandum on expanding strategic partnership in the field of the nuclear fuel cycle. The Memorandum confirms all the previous agreements between the two countries in respect of the collaboration in the nuclear industry, including uranium production and processing. In addition, the document mentions the opportunity of Russia and Kazakhstan’s mutual participation in IAEA projects. The placement of the LEU Bank in the territory of the Republic is a grand gesture towards the IAEA, which will raise the profile of Kazakhstan in the eyes of other states. The LEU bank will prevent existing nuclear reactors from experiencing fuel deficit and it will promote the non-proliferation of the nuclear weapons. In fact, countries wishing to develop peaceful atomic energy often have to enrich uranium on their own in order to make fuel from it. Meanwhile, the IAEA fears that some of them may exceed the enrichment level for peaceful purposes and obtain material for the creation of nuclear weapons. The LEU Bank, which any of the IAEA Member States may turn to, will mean they no longer have to enrich uranium independently thus reducing the threat of the nuclear weapon proliferation. Thus, Kazakhstan may become a strategically important member of the IAEA and participate in ensuring global security. Apart from a reputation boost and assistance in the nuclear projects, this may attract the attention of foreign investors. According to the government of Kazakhstan, the volume of foreign investment in the country’s economy increased 5 times in the first half of 2016 and amounted to almost 6 billion US dollars. This growth is undoubtedly linked to Kazakhstan’s improved international standing, which has partially resulted from its cooperation with the IAEA.

       " ['Veterans ‘Deploy’ To Standing Rock To Engage The Enemy — The US Government',\n",
       "  'Planet Progressive 3 \\nOn Dec. 4, hundreds of veterans will muster at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. The mission: To stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. \\n“Most civilians who’ve never served in a uniform are gutless worms who’ve never been in a fight in their life,” Wes Clark Jr. declares. “So if we don’t stop it, who will?” \\nClark Jr. is one of the most vociferous opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a controversial 1,170-mile project that, if and when it is completed, will shuttle an estimated 470,000 barrels of crude oil every day from North Dakota to Illinois. “It’s immoral, and wrong, and dangerous to us all,” Clark Jr. adds. \\nHe doesn’t fit the traditional tree-hugger mold. He’s not a hippie. Nor is he a member of the Lakota or Dakota tribes, the two Native American group known collectively as the Sioux. He’s a former Army officer and the organizer of an upcoming three-day deployment of U.S. military veterans to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in southern North Dakota, the site of an escalating months-long standoff between law enforcement-backed security contractors and activists that has so far resulted in multiple injuries, more than 500 arrests, and a United Nations investigation of potential human rights abuses. \\nAccording to an “operations order” for the planned engagement, posted to social media in mid-November, “First Americans have served in the Unites States Military, defending the soil of our homelands, at a greater percentage than any other group of Americans. There is no other people more deserving of veteran support.” \\nClark Jr. is a 47-year-old writer, political commentator, and activist based in California. Joining him in the fight is Michael A. Wood Jr., a Marine Corps veteran and former Baltimore police officer who retired his badge in 2014 to become an advocate for national police reform. Earlier this month, the duo formed Veterans Stand For Standing Rock with the hope of drawing scores of veterans, as well as fire fighters, ex-law enforcement officers, emergency medical personnel and others to the battleground for a three-day “deployment” in early December to “prevent progress on the Dakota Access Pipeline and draw national attention to the human rights warriors of the Sioux tribes.” Both men say they’re prepared to take a bullet, rubber or otherwise, for a cause they believe should be of critical importance to any patriotic American. \\n“This country is repressing our people,” Wood Jr. says. “If we’re going to be heroes, if we’re really going to be those veterans that this country praises, well, then we need to do the things that we actually said we’re going to do when we took the oath to defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic.” \\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Reservation was originally established as part of the Great Sioux Reservation under Article 2 of the Treaty of Fort Laramie of April 29, 1868. In 1877, the U.S. government initiated the still ongoing process of chipping away and dividing the land it had granted to the people of the Lakota and Dakota nations, with significant reductions taking place in 1889 and then again during the 1950s and 1960s, when the Army Corps of Engineers built five large dams along the Missouri River, uprooting villages and sinking 200,000 acres of land below water. \\nWhen the Corps of Engineers returned to Standing Rock in 2015, it was to assess whether or not it should approve a path for the Dakota Access Pipeline across the Missouri River, a project that would involve construction on some of the land that had been stripped from the Sioux, who still regard it as sacred — although, that fact seems to have been ignored, maybe even intentionally, in the assessment. \\nBecause the Corps neglected to consult the Standing Rock Sioux, as it was required to do under the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106), the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Interior, and the American Council on Historic Preservation all criticized the assessment, but the project was eventually approved. The decision was a major victory for Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based parent company of Dakota Access LLC, which estimates the pipeline will bring $156 million in sales and income taxes to state and local governments and create thousands of temporary jobs. \\nFor the Standing Rock Sioux, the Dakota Access project poses two immediate threats. First, the pipeline would run beneath Lake Oahe, the reservoir that provides drinking water to the people of Standing Rock. (An earlier route that avoided native lands was ruled out in part because it posed a danger to drinking water.) Second, according to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, the building of the pipeline would destroy the sacred spots and burial grounds that were overlooked in the Corps’ assessment. But as the protests have intensified, and more outsiders, including members of more than 200 Native American tribes from across North America, have become involved, Standing Rock has, for some, come to represent something much bigger than a struggle between a disenfranchised people and a government-backed, billion-dollar corporation. It’s a battle to save humanity from itself. \\n“Mother Earth’s axis is off and it’s never going back,” says Phyllis Young, a Sioux tribal elder. “And we have to help keep it in balance for as long as we can. I am a mother and a grandmother. Those are my credentials to ensure a future with clean drinking water — a future of human dignity, human rights, and human survival.” \\nYoung grew up on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. She has been present at many of the protests and says she’s seen people brutalized at the hands of the security contractors and law enforcement officials guarding the land where the drilling is set to take place. It was Young who got Clark Jr involved. In late summer, she was in Washington, D.C., lobbying for the military to promote an alternative (and scientifically dubious) clean energy source called low-energy nuclear reaction, when she heard of a military veteran who was a forceful advocate for environmental conservation. Clark Jr. was eager to help. He spent weeks trying to assemble a legal team for the Standing Rock Sioux, and even contacted Independent Diplomat, a nonprofit organization that helps governments navigate complex diplomatic processes. “I pulled all of the levers, and none of them worked,” Clark Jr. recalls. Then, in early November, the plan dawned on him: He’d bring his fellow veterans. Lots of them. And they’d come prepared to put their lives on the line. \\n“We’re not going out there to get in a fight with anyone,” Clark Jr. says. “They can feel free to beat us up, but we’re 100% nonviolence.” \\nYou may have heard of Clark Jr.’s father. Wesley Clark Sr. retired from the Army in 2000 as a four-star general. His career began in the jungles of Vietnam, where he was shot four times during an enemy ambush near Saigon, and culminated in a posting as Supreme Allied Commander Europe during the Kosovo War. In 2004, he ran for the Democratic Party presidential nomination on platform that criticized the Iraq War and called for measures to combat climate change. Clark Jr., who was born in Florida while Clark Sr. was in Vietnam and grew up on military bases throughout the United States and Europe, seems to have inherited both his father’s commanding spirit and his progressive ideals. \\nClark Jr. had just graduated from Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service when he joined the Army as a cavalry officer. He served on active duty from 1992–1996 — “nothing dangerous,” he says. On Sept. 11, 2001, he was living in New York City, and after seeing the towers fall, he decided to re-enlist. “I was like, ‘I’m going back in. I’m going to go in there and fuck people up,’” he recalls. It was Clark Sr., the decorated war hero, who convinced him not to. As Clark Jr. recalls, his father foresaw U.S. military intervention in Iraq and warned that as a soldier he would be fighting a war that had nothing to do with defeating al Qaeda. “He was right, but I’ll tell you, I’ve never felt worse about a decision in my life,” Clark Jr. says. \\nClark Jr. may never have served in combat, but when he talks about Standing Rock, he sounds like a battle-hardened general. This isn’t his first foray into boots-on-the-ground environmental activism. He’s currently working with an organization called Climate Mobilization, which is focused on “building and supporting a social movement that causes the US federal government to commence WWII-scale climate mobilization.” But he’s perhaps best known as a co-host of the political web series The Young Turks. On the The Young Turks website, Clark Jr. is described as an Army veteran “currently trying to save human civilization from climate change.” The impending confrontation at Standing Rock, he says, will be “the most important event up to this time in human history.” \\nVets Standing For Standing Rock was announced via an official sounding letter formatted like a five-paragraph military operation order, breaking down the “opposing forces” — “Morton County Sheriff’s office combined with multiple state police agencies and private security contractors” — “Mission,” “Execution” and “Logistics,” among other things. A packing list virtually mirrors the ones issued to soldiers preparing to deploy to the field (minus the weapons). But there are also parts of the document that read like a revolutionary manifesto. Under the section titled “Friendly Forces,” for example, the op order states, “we are there to put our bodies on the line, no matter the physical cost, in complete nonviolence to provide a clear representation to all Americans of where evil resides.” \\nThe document was accompanied by a link to a GoFundMe campaign that has raised nearly $20,000 of its $100,000 goal since it was created on Nov. 11. The money, Clark Jr. says, will only be used for helping volunteers with transportation costs and then bailing those who are arrested out of jail. \\nWood Jr. says the op-order was Clark Jr.’s idea, but the two men agree that organizing like a military unit is the smartest approach, especially because most of the people expected to join them on the ground have served. \\n“It’s simple and we have clearly defined goals, so people don’t get caught up in the confusion,” says Wood Jr., who served with the Baltimore Police Department for more than a decade. “One of the issues the police are going to face is that our level of planning and coordination is vastly superior to theirs, so they may end up with a problem when it comes to that.” \\nHere then is the plan: On Dec. 4, Clark Jr. and Wood Jr., along with a group of veterans and other folks in the “bravery business,” as Wood Jr. puts it — 500 total is the goal, but they’re hoping for more — will muster at Standing Rock. The following morning they will join members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, including Young, for a traditional healing ceremony. With an eye toward the media, old military uniforms will be donned so that if the veterans are brutalized by the police, they are brutalized not as ordinary citizens, but as people who once served the government they are protesting against. Then body armor, ear plugs, and gas masks will be issued to those who didn’t bring their own. Bagpipes will play, and traditional Sioux war songs will be sung. The music will continue as everyone marches together to the banks of the Missouri, on the other side of which a line of guards in riot gear will be standing ready with rifles, mace, batons, and dogs. Then, the veterans and their allies — or at least the ones who are brave enough — will lock arms and cross the river in a “massive line” for their “first encounter” with the “opposing forces.” The goal is to make it to the drilling pad and surround it, arm in arm. That will require making it through the line of guards, who have repelled other such attempts with a level of physical force Sioux tribal members and protesters have described as “excessive” — claims that recently prompted a United Nations investigation. Of course, that’s what the body armor and gas masks are for. \\n“We’ll have those people who will recognize that they’re not willing to take a bullet, and those who recognize that they are,” says Wood Jr. “It’s okay if some of them step back, but Wes and I have no intention of doing so.” \\nOf course, as most veterans know full well, even the best plans go out the window the moment the shit hits the fan. It seems probable that the group will be met by fierce resistance from those charged with keeping people out of the construction site. Despite a recent decision by the Corps of Engineers to delay further work on the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners is still hoping to complete the project by January. The segment that will cross beneath the Missouri at Standing Rock is the last major piece of the puzzle. Strengthening the resolve of the company’s executives is the fact that Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren donated more than $100,000 to elect Donald Trump, and Trump himself owns stock in the company. “I’m 100% sure that the pipeline will be approved by a Trump administration,” Warren told NBC News on Nov. 12. \\nNonetheless, Clark Jr. and Wood Jr. remain undeterred. If anything, the likelihood of approval only makes them more determined. After all, this is war. \\n“The Joint Chiefs of Staff labeled the climate emergency as the number one security threat to the country, and they’ve been labeling it that for years,” Clark Jr. says. “All you need to do is put an overlay on any map in the world where there’s a water and crisis and you’re going to see massive political violence in that location. And unless we act, we’re going to be dealing with that exact same situation right here in the United States.” Tell us what you think Related Posts '],\n",

       "  'BREAKING: DOJ FINALLY Secures Warrant To Inspect Huma’s Emails By: Michael Qazvini October 30, 2016 On the heels of FBI Director James Comey’s unexpected Friday announcement about revisiting the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the US Department of Justice has officially obtained a warrant to inspect Huma Abedin’s stash of emails. Abedin is perhaps Hillary Clinton’s closest confidante. During the course of the FBI’s investigation, she spoke with federal agents on several occasions, evading questions and providing only vague answers to direct inquiries. “The process has begun,” stated the bureau Sunday in a rather cryptic message, suggesting that Abedin’s emails will be possibly be examined before election day. Enjoying intimate access to the former secretary of state, Abedin sent several emails through Hillary’s private server. A few months ago, the FBI explicitly asked Abedin to hand over any information, including emails and devices those emails may be stored in to investigators. It now looks like she failed to comply with the request. In a bizarre twist of events, the FBI found hundreds of thousands of Abedin’s emails stored on a laptop belonging to her now-estranged husband. The emails were discovered as investigators seized evidence related to a separate investigation regarding an inquiry into disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner’s possible sexual overtures to a minor. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chats with her staff, including aide Huma Abedin (L), onboard her plane in White Plains, New York, October 22, 2016, on her way to a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. / AFP / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images) Law enforcement officials have been hesitant to provide a timeline to the public for when the completion of its review of this treasure trove of emails. There may be evidence hiding in those emails that could incriminate Abedin’s boss, US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But we likely won’t find out until after the election, raising unsettling questions about the integrity of our fragile democracy. \\nAs a matter of principle, the FBI should tell the American people everything it knows before voters cast their ballots on November 8th.

       " ['Is Obama Staging a Color Revolution in the US | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: USA in the World The recent victory of now President-elect Donald Trump has taken a lot of Americans by surprise. But it would be safe to say that the corporate ruling elites that went all in on Hillary Clinton were literally shocked by her defeat. Without her at the head of the state they fear they may not be able to carry on spreading the corruption, which is believed to be at the foundation of the Clinton clan, or carry on waging wars upon other states which includes arming terrorists responsible for killing thousands of civilians around the world. And even though the corporate elites have formally acknowledged Trump’s victory, they are pressuring the current government to fight the next US President tooth and nail, until all resources are exhausted. Over the last eight years, the Obama administration has acquired a long list of tricks that were used against undesired governments in various parts of the world, while the most effective among them is the so-called “color revolutions,” where essentially a coup d’etat is achieved by media manipulation and large mobs. US intelligence services are now prepared to unleash such a revolution on the home front, since they are fairly concerned about their future under Trump, as the Washington Post would report. The fact that Obama still believes in Trump’s inability to replace him in the White House has already been announced by the White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. At the same time, he would point out, while commenting on the anti-Trump protests in the US, that the right for freedom of expression must be exercised without violence, clearly alluding to the current administration’s arsenal of “peaceful” tools that would allow it to get rid of Trump. That is why we already are witnessing a wave of “protests” being unleashed under the control of the Obama administration. The corporate media and social networks are openly arrayed against the incoming 45th US President. These very tactics have been used by US intelligence agencies in Brazil, Nicaragua, Hong Kong, Thailand, as well as across the Middle East and Eastern Europe to unleash a “color revolution”. In some countries, such actions have brought foreign government under the direct control of the White House, as we can see it in Ukraine, Brazil and several other countries. As a result, we are now being told about thousands of protesters in US cities rallying against the Trump election victory. These claims were followed by a petition published on Change.org that demands the US authorities change the results of the recent election, demanding the electoral college be revised, and that the election results be overturned on December 19. It is being reported that this petition has already been signed by a total of two million people . It goes without saying that an attempt to launch a “color revolution” in the United States is being supported by a number of Europe states in addition to the US, including France and Germany, since the political order there is concerned about the impunity they’ve been enjoying coming to an end, with Trump failing to openly signal continued open US support for them.. The British Independent wants Trump to be impeached, citing law professor Christopher Peterson, who would claim that there is a strong case for the beginning of legal proceedings that would stop Donald Trump from being president. The impeachment process is usually initiated when a president of a state has committed some sort of a serious offense, but Trump hasn’t been able to do anything yet, since he hasn’t been inaugurated. Still the Independent believes there must be some legal ground for his impeachment. It’s clear the train of “color revolution” is under full steam in the US today. What will come up from this attempt to ignore the US Constitution, remains to be seen.

The 31-year-old took to Instagram to share a photo of herself posed with her hands on her mega hips wearing the ‘Respect Women #Dump Trump’ shirt. ( Hey, why wasn’t she arrested for causing visual pollution in Times Square? ) UK Daily Mail ‘Respect Women,’ she captioned the image. ‘Our bodies are not for you to stare at or touch without our consent. Women are not just sexual objects, women are not here for your consumption. (One problem you don’t have, cupcake) The 31-year-old took to Instagram over the weekend to share an ad of herself posing in New York City’s Times Square while modeling a New Look Fashion T-shirt that reads: ‘Respect Women #Dump Trump.’ So many of us have a sexual assault story, myself included,’ she continued.

       "  'Tweet \\nLAS VEGAS, NV – Patient Brian McDowell put on a show for the ages, as he became the first patient on a hospital bed to successfully leap through a ring of fire unscathed. Performed during a matinee show at the MGM Grand Hospital yesterday, health care personnel applaud the act, calling it the best combination of entertainment and treatment in recent memory. \\n“There hasn’t been much to write about since Philip Rogers rode in a wheelchair through a halfpipe back in 2001,” wrote local entertainment reporter Eva Roberts. “All we’ve had is magic mouthwash and pet therapy , but that’s about it. McDowell’s death-defying leap against patient safety precautions was a much needed breath of fresh air.” Thankfully, the Joint Commission wasn’t there to witness it. \\nThe 55-year-old McDowell has always been a lifelong adventurer. His youth saw participation in skateboarding, snowboarding, and motocross biking until “a few too many broken bones ” sidelined him for good over two decades ago. However, it was during this most recent hospitalization that McDowell felt the old itch come back and thought the hospital was just the place to get things started. \\n“The way I saw it, the worst thing that happens, I get set on fire and there’s a burn unit right here; or if I broke a bone, I knew ortho , PT, and OT would be ready and waiting,” explained McDowell. “Best case scenario I’ve provided a hospital, a setting not typically known for world-class entertainment, something to talk about for weeks, months, maybe even years to come.” McDowell idolized Rogers and his wheelchair X Games jumps, and wanted to make a name for himself in a hospital one day. \\nAfter convincing his transport tech to arrange the ramps accordingly and give him a good running push, McDowell used his arms and body to steer the hospital bed before he took off “like a Haldol blowdart ,” guiding himself through the heart of the ring of fire. His landing was perfect, no bedsheets were singed, and everyone there to witness the feat got on their feet to give McDowell a rousing standing ovation . \\nThough McDowell is being treated for asthma exacerbation, he reassures his family, friends, and Gomerblog that the smoke inhalation while passing through the smoky ring of fire was “minimal,”“worth it,” and “better than a ring of my aunt’s perfume.” \\nMcDowell finishes an albuterol nebulizer treatment, takes the mask off, and hacks up some charred mucous. “If it brought a smile to even one person who looked up from their charting , it was worth it, it was totally worth it.” 87 Shares '],\n",
       " ['To Survive, Evolve - Russia News Now',\n",
       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\nThe concept of evolution should not be limited to the scientific assertions around Darwin’s theory of natural selection, but ought to include the more general idea that people and processes constantly evolve in response to the forces that surround them. We evolve from childhood into adulthood, and, ideally, from self-centeredness toward the good of larger entities like our community or nation (and now, faced with climate change, the good of our planet). Political arrangements have evolved from the divine right of kings into still–evolving democratic systems. \\nA Supreme Court justice’s orientation toward evolution in this basic sense determines whether he or she is a strict originalist (a nicer word for fundamentalist), or sees the Constitution as a living document that must be responsive to changing conditions. No founding father composing the second amendment could have foreseen the surfeit of guns decimating our country today. \\nSuch evolutionary processes are alive, dynamic, an unstoppable juggernaut pervading every aspect of reality. Against them, even the determination not to evolve has evolutionary effects, as we have seen in the bizarre presidential process of the past year. A Neanderthal candidate has helped awaken a generation of young women, and ideally young men also, to evolve beyond being victims of crude chauvinist stereotypes. \\nThe whole cosmos has been evolving for 13.8 billion years, from energy to matter to, here on earth, life and self-conscious life. Evolution is the context of our reality, the story all humans share. This story is beginning to seep into collective consciousness in a way that may yet render obsolete divisions such as those between Shia and Sunni, let alone between “radical Islamic fundamentalism” and the “post-Enlightenment West.” We all evolved from the same mysterious source. Every differentiation in that largest context, by race, tribe, religion, ethnicity, feels arbitrary and abstract. \\nIt is not surprising that fundamentalism in whatever form has often found the evolutionary paradigm threatening, because it implies a challenging dynamic of change that feels insecure. For many believers, to generalize unfairly, religion provides behavioral rules that can be a source of security and comfort even as they are used as excuses to remain exclusive and resist evolving. \\nWithin each world religion, there are minority enclaves (the Sufis in Islam, Zen practitioners of Buddhism, Catholic mystics like Teilhard de Chardin) who understand that their spiritual discipline is an opportunity to evolve toward inclusivity, toward looking within at fears and projections rather than looking outward for enemies, and toward expanding our identifications and responsibilities beyond the national to the planetary. \\nFar from being a benign, feel-good process, evolution is often painful, one step forward, two back. Take the tortured but necessary demise of the American coal industry. No one wants to see the debilitating effects of unemployment on real people with real families, but so far the technology of coal burning hasn’t evolved a way not to accelerate global warming. \\nWe humans are supposedly not built to respond effectively to long-term threats like changes in climate, but, late in the game as it is, we do seem to be collectively learning what is at stake and evolving locally and globally. Entrepreneurs are rapidly bringing to market solar, wind, and other cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. \\nUnfortunately, negative and harmful processes can also become subject to an evolutionary juggernaut. Since 1945 weapons systems have evolved (more accurately, we have evolved them) to a level of complexity and destructive power that we are already powerless to control. The Pentagon is reported to be spending its usual vast sums on research into computer-controlled robotic drones capable of making their own autonomous decisions about who is an enemy. The defense establishments of other great nations are presumably up to the same mischief, or soon will be, because the arms race never stops evolving. Or won’t until we embrace a new way of thinking: that we must evolve to survive. \\nWe, we the nations, are hopelessly complacent in our present reliance upon deterrence as a workable security system. As the fellow falling from the hundredth floor said as he passed the sixtieth: so far so good. The system, an emperor with no clothes solemnly worshipped by legions of self-confident experts, is too complex not to be subject to breakdown at any moment, perhaps by accident, perhaps where NATO and Russia push up against each other in Eastern Europe, perhaps in Kashmir. \\nThe threat of nuclear extinction provides a new context for the obsolete parochialism of the world’s major religions. If this threat isn’t enough to accelerate the ecumenical impulse, what is? As people of diverse spiritual worldviews acknowledge that they have in common the possibility of annihilation, our shared anxiety can energize evolution toward inclusivity and nonviolent solutions to conflict. The world is in a race between fundamentalists and arms manufacturers on the one hand, and evolutionaries who see clearly both the futile dead-end of the arms race and the possibility of a security built upon the truth of interdependence, which appears in similar form in all the religions as the Golden Rule. We will live together or die together. As we treat others, so we will be treated. Whether they each understand this or not, this is the hidden-in-plain-sight background behind the Trump-Clinton mud-wrestle. \\nWill the arms manufacturers and the politicians in league with them evolve in the face of the nuclear threat in a way similar to our positive responses to the challenge of climate instability? I live in Maine, where the state’s largest private employer is the Bath Iron Works. They are building three of a new kind of guided missile destroyer that is contoured to hide from radar. Each one costs 4 billion dollars. Recently I had a conversation with an Iron Works employee. I made the assumption that, given his job, he would be hawkishly supportive of a robust military. Not at all. His exact parting words were “I’d be much happier building solar panels.” Related '],\n",

       " ['The Results Are In: This Is the Best Sex Toy for Women, Ever : Conscious Life News',\n",
       "  'PDF \\nBy Jordan Gray | jordangrayconsulting.com \\nLast week I released the article The Best Sex Toy For Men, Ever . And, understandably, my female followers wanted to see an article written with them in mind. Now, I’ve never inhabited a female body in this lifetime, and am ill equipped to say what works best for women. So I enlisted the help of my thousands of female readers by asking them a series of questions. I started by asking them what their favourite sex toy was. There were a few forerunners (all of which are mentioned near the end of this article), but the name that popped up (by FAR) the most frequently was the Magic Wand . Once the winner (by critical mass/popular vote) was established, I dove into the deeper questions. The Magic Wand (which was apparently originally intended to be a massage device) is most often used by women as a vibrator to achieve clitoral and/or combination orgasms. It used to be called The Hitachi Magic Wand, but the product was rebranded to just being called the Magic Wand in recent years. \\nThe following women that I quoted range in age from 20-60, and they live all around the world. Some of them asked that I used their real names, and others asked that I used a changed/anonymous name. \\nEnough with the logistics, let’s get into it. If you’ve ever considered upgrading your sex life with the Rolls Royce of women’s sex toys, then this is the article for you. How Does The Magic Wand Feel? \\n“It’s physically impossible not to cum. It’s like being on a roller coaster… when it drops you, your body naturally has to scream. You couldn’t sit there in silence even if you wanted to.” – Jennifer D. \\n“Feels intense, for me it’s usually the one I go to for a quicker, more immediate orgasm (like trying to get a quickie in while the toddler naps!).” – Allison D. \\n“The intensity is unlike anything else I’ve ever experienced. I haven’t used a different toy since purchasing. Intense, toe curling orgasms that can be as quick or long as you wish. And no batteries!” – Rachel K. \\n“The Magic Wand feels VERY intense. What I do is build myself up manually until I am ready for the sensations it produces–I’ve never just gone to it from the start, that would be too much. I use it directly on my clitoris, starting on the low setting. For me, it begins to produce orgasm almost immediately–however, it’s different than using my hand, with a defined peak and decrescendo. \\n“The orgasm is instantaneous… the Magic Wand basically ‘forces’ my body onto a higher plane of pleasure. It takes me much longer to reach my peak, which means that I can orgasm for as long as I can handle it!” – Annika C. How Do You Use The Magic Wand? \\n“You plug it in, apply the head of it to your clitoris, and begin seeing stars.” – Alisha T. \\n“I use it by myself and with my partner. He actually finds it really sexy.” – Kassidy P. \\n“I like changing up my position when using it. I like using it while I’m on my knees with one hand on my headboard. Or when I’m standing with the Magic Wand laying flat over the bed so I can prop my leg up and maneuver my body in the right position. I love changing up the position because it reiterates how powerful the toy is. \\nAside from switching up positions, when close to my orgasm, I change the pressure of the toy. Because it is such a powerful vibration, I try to hold it firmer and longer, even after my orgasm is finished. It almost feels torturous and there is something sexy about that. I also find it prolongs the orgasm and builds me up for the next one. The toy is so strong that the immediate reaction is to move it when your body is peaking. I found a lot of pleasure in seeing how far I can take it, holding it in the same position until I’m squirming around uncontrollably. \\nUsing with a partner is also fun. I love being teased by it – over top of my panties or being tied up so I can’t squirm away when the vibrations get so intense. I think it’s a great toy to use solo and with someone else.” – Rachel K. Any Specific Things That You Have To Consider While Using It? \\n“Yes — it is a bit loud so if you have roommates or thin walls, this is something you’ll want to consider when purchasing.” – Erica K. \\n“I had an orgasm the very first time I tried to give myself one as a teenager and I’ve been having them ever since. I never EVER had trouble on that front. So, for me, this is something I use if I have a lot of tumescence built up, haven’t been with anyone in awhile, or just need to dull my very high libido for a day or two. I’ll use it maybe once a month, and I’ve gone months without touching it.” – Annika C. \\n“Yes. Sometimes the lowest setting on the Magic Wand is still too intense for me, and I use this dial to bring it down considerably.” – Amanda T. Pros And Cons Of The Magic Wand? \\nThe pros and cons were quite consistent from all of my interviewees across the board. Mainly (pros) that it’s powerful, effective, and durable… and (cons) bulky, has a cord, and not very pretty looking. – Pros Of The Magic Wand \\n“The Magic Wand is great for high-intensity direct clitoral stimulation.” – Erica K. \\n“It gets the job done, I don’t have to charge it or replace batteries, it’s super effective!” – Allison D. \\n“I would say both the pros and cons of this are derived from the fact that it makes you come fast.” – Ostara C. \\n“I bring the Magic Wand to every group sex session my partner and I have because it takes the pressure off the guys for having to make a girl (who’s vagina they’ve never met) cum.” – Alexa R. \\n“The Magic Wand is responsible for the realization that I can squirt, as well! What I’ve found is that the sensations will build and build, and in order to really reach the peak, I have to ejaculate first. It’s truly out of this world!” – Annika C. \\n“Pros for me are that those times when the little vibrator isn’t getting me to an orgasm, the “big guy” usually can. So if I WANT an orgasm and can’t seem to get to it (usually masturbating) I can USUALLY get it with the big guy.” – Lauren A. \\n“1) It’s super durable, 2) it’s super powerful so with a dimmer it gives me maximum flexibility since I do have partners who like more intensity than I do, 3) Because it is a fairly well known product, it’s easy to find accessories and attachments that make it more fun, 4) It actually works pretty well as a neck massager.” – Joy D. – Cons Of The Magic Wand \\n“The downside is how bulky they are. Not easy for travel.” – Anne R. \\n“My biggest thing with it is that it is STRONG. And personally, that’s not always a good thing. When I first got it I would use it over a cloth or something so that it wasn’t directly on my clit. And still I would orgasm and then have not fun tingly clit for ages after.” – Lauren A. \\n“It’s a bit medical looking. Part of me wishes they came in fun colours. There’s nothing really “cute” about it.” – Rachel K. \\n“I do prefer, for myself, to come more naturally and with something less POWERFUL (it really is very strong) as I like my clit to be sensitive. But sometimes I just want to cum and that’s the toy to do it. But rarely do I use it right against my skin anymore. And when I have to press it really hard against myself, I know I’ll have a sore clit for a few days (and not be able to masturbate again) so I have to want that orgasm a lot.” – Heather S. \\n“It’s a little addictive in a way, I find that if I use it too often I’m less sensitive for using my other toys or manual stimulation or even if hubby goes down on me. Also, have to be careful not to get the inside of the white part wet when washing it.” – Allison D. \\n“1) It’s big & not cordless so that’s a little inconvenient, 2) without a dimmer switch it’s too intense so might not be for everyone out of box, 3) the wand head is fairly big so if you are someone who likes more precision it’s unwieldy.” – Joy D. \\n“The cord may not be long enough. For me personally, it’s not always as intense as I’d like it to be.” – Erica K. \\n(Editor’s note: the cord is about 6 feet/2 metres long) Who Would You Recommend The Magic Wand To? \\n“I would recommend it to any woman who likes to orgasm.” – Lauren A. \\n“I would recommend it to anyone. I don’t have orgasms from penetration so I’d especially recommend it to women who are on the same boat.” – Kassidy P. \\n“I’d recommend this to anyone who wants to level up their pleasure and really explore their sexuality independent of a partner, but with the caveat that it’s powerful and you don’t want to become too dependent on it!! I use it independently of a man. I’ve had two rabbits and neither of them came close. I adore a man’s dick so much, there could be no substitute. I think that’s another reason I love the Wand–it’s not like a dick!” – Annika C. \\n“I’ve already recommended it to most of my friends (with the exception of the ones who aren’t very sexual/kind of prudish). I would recommend it to anyone who wants a powerful orgasm… this is a fantastic way to achieve that!” – Allison D. \\n“I read a lot online before purchasing this. Lots of people said it’s not the best starter toy. I disagree. I think any woman or couple looking to enhance their orgasms would find great value in this toy.” – Rachel K. \\n“I would recommend The Wand to anyone: wether you’re new to vibrators or simply new to toys like the wand. Most women consider it their go-to.” – Erica K. Are There Any Specific Attachments You Would Recommend Picking Up With The Magic Wand? \\n“I got this dimmer switch for it which makes it way more usable for me personally. I do like it as a toy for play with a partner though!” – Joy D. '],\n",

       "  'THIS IS COMEY’S LAST CHANCE FOR REDEMPTION THIS IS COMEY’S LAST CHANCE FOR REDEMPTION Politics By TruthFeedNews October 29, 2016 \\nBy Gregg Jarrett \\nThe most wounded man in Washington is James Comey. \\nEver since his legally incomprehensible announcement that he would not recommend criminal prosecution of Hillary Clinton, he has been the equivalent of an extra on the set of “The Walking Dead”. His reputation tarnished. His legacy forever tainted. \\nHis own agents turned against him in disgust. Those, including lawyers, who had worked exhaustively gathering the incriminating evidence were furious that Comey had publicly laid out their case of how Clinton was grossly negligence under the Espionage Act, yet decided not to prosecute. Comey had gone from revered to reviled, all in one day. \\nNow, his stunning announcement that he is reopening the criminal investigation of Clinton based on newly discovered evidence is, perhaps, the chance at redemption for which he may have been searching. He has disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner to thank for a second chance. \\nAccording to confirmed reports, the FBI seized electronic devices in the possession of Weiner during the course of an investigation into his sexting with an underage girl for which he is now in legal jeopardy. Since Weiner is married to Clinton’s top aide, Huma Abedin, the FBI were legally entitled to access her emails on those same devices. Those are probably the messages that triggered a reopening of the Clinton probe. \\nWhatever the source of the new evidence, it may have provided the excuse or pretext that Comey so desperately needed to remedy the wrong perceived by so many. A legal “do over”, if you will. A mistake corrected. An injustice rectified. \\nOf course, it is altogether possible that Comey will reach the same conclusion as he did before –that prosecutors could not prove Clinton broke the law. His statement stressed he does not know the “importance” of the new emails. \\nBut if this is Comey’s opportunity to atone, it is not good news for Hillary Clinton. The Director may now be more determined than ever to reverse his legal judgment of Clinton’s mishandling of classified materials. It’s like a first year law student getting to retake the final examination in criminal law after flunking the test. He can now change his legal analysis and arrive at a better conclusion. \\nAfter all, it was Comey himself who testified before Congress that more than 2,000 classified documents were found on Clinton’s personal server in her home –clearly an unauthorized place under the law. He described her explanations as untruthful and her conduct “extremely careless”. That would be more than sufficient for criminal charges against anyone else whose name is not Clinton. \\nWhat does all of this mean for Clinton’s chances of winning the election a scant ten days from now? At this early stage, it is impossible to know. Yes, at the moment, the electoral map favors Clinton substantially. But that could evaporate in a political instant. \\nOn its face, the revelation seems extremely damaging to her candidacy. Perhaps fatal. Yet, it is premature to say how voters will react on November 8 th when they enter the voting booths across America. Some may view the resurrected FBI probe as patently unfair, coming a little more than a week before the election. Voters may feel she is being victimized and react with sympathy. The news may energize or motivate her supporters to cast their ballots in record numbers. \\nFor others, a reinvigorated FBI investigation will serve as proof they were right when they concluded, perhaps long ago, that Clinton is chronically corrupt. As pointed out in my recent column , a Clinton presidency would probably be engulfed in scandal and endless investigations, even in the absence of today’s news. Do Americans want to cast a vote in favor of 4 years of acrimony and intransigence? \\nAnd what happens if a President Clinton is indicted for crimes under the Espionage Act? Would she resign, as Nixon did… or temporarily step aside under the incapacity provision of the 25 th Amendment until her criminal trial is concluded? How would Congress react? The entire sordid affair could devolve into an impeachment trial reminiscent of her husband, Bill Clinton. \\nAnother national nightmare. \\nThese are weighty decisions which voters are now suddenly forced to consider. It may not be fair or right. But, in a democracy, freedom of choice inexorably falls to the citizenry. \\nIt brings both benefits and burdens. \\nGregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.

By Dennis Kucinich\\n The Nation \" - W ashington, DC, may be the only place in the world where people openly flaunt their pseudo-intellectuality by banding together, declaring themselves \\x93think tanks,\\x94 and raising money from external interests, including foreign governments, to compile reports that advance policies inimical to the real-life concerns of the American people.\\nAs a former member of the House of Representatives, I remember 16 years of congressional hearings where pedigreed experts came to advocate wars in testimony based on circular, rococo thinking devoid of depth, reality, and truth. I remember other hearings where the Pentagon was unable to reconcile over $1 trillion in accounts, lost track of $12 billion in cash sent to Iraq, and rigged a missile-defense test so that an interceptor could easily home in on a target. War is first and foremost a profitable racket.\\nHow else to explain that in the past 15 years this city\\x92s so called bipartisan foreign policy elite has promoted wars in Iraq and Libya, and interventions in Syria and Yemen, which have opened Pandora\\x92s box to a trusting world, to the tune of trillions of dollars, a windfall for military contractors. DC\\x92s think \\x93tanks\\x94 should rightly be included in the taxonomy of armored war vehicles and not as gathering places for refugees from academia.\\nAccording to the front page of this past Friday\\x92s Washington Post , the bipartisan foreign-policy elite recommends the next president show less restraint than President Obama. Acting at the urging of \\x93liberal\\x94 hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention, read war, the Obama administration attacked Libya along with allied powers working through NATO.\\nThe think tankers fell in line with the Iraq invasion. Not being in the tank, I did my own analysis of the call for war in October of 2002, based on readily accessible information, and easily concluded that there was no justification for war. I distributed it widely in Congress and led 125 Democrats in voting against the Iraq war resolution. There was no money to be made from a conclusion that war was uncalled for, so, against millions protesting in the United States and worldwide, our government launched into an abyss, with a lot of armchair generals waving combat pennants. The marching band and chowder society of DC think tanks learned nothing from the Iraq and Libya experience.\\nThe only winners were arms dealers, oil companies, and jihadists. Immediately after the fall of Libya, the black flag of Al Qaeda was raised over a municipal building in Benghazi, Gadhafi\\x92s murder was soon to follow, with Secretary Clinton quipping with a laugh, \\x93We came, we saw, he died.\\x94 President Obama apparently learned from this misadventure, but not the Washington policy establishment, which is spoiling for more war.\\nThe self-identified liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) is now calling for Syria to be bombed, and estimates America\\x92s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on \\x93mission accomplished.\\x94 CAP, according to a report in The Nation , has received funding from war contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the bombers that CAP wants to rain hellfire on Syria.\\nThe Brookings Institute has taken tens of millions from foreign governments , notably Qatar, a key player in the military campaign to oust Assad. Retired four-star Marine general John Allen is now a Brookings senior fellow . Charles Lister is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute , which has received funding from Saudi Arabia , the major financial force providing billions in arms to upend Assad and install a Sunni caliphate stretching across Iraq and Syria. Foreign-government money is driving our foreign policy.\\nAs the drumbeat for an expanded war gets louder, Allen and Lister jointly signed an op-ed in the Sunday Washington Post , calling for an attack on Syria. The Brookings Institute, in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcom, where General Allen shared leadership duties with General David Petraeus. Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war? This is academic integrity, DC-style.\\nAnd why is Central Command, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation, and the US Department of Health and Human Services giving money to Brookings ?\\nFormer secretary of state Madeleine Albright, who famously told Colin Powell , \\x93What\\x92s the point of having this superb military you\\x92re always talking about if we can\\x92t use it,\\x94 predictably says of this current moment , \\x93We do think there needs to be more American action.\\x94 A former Bush administration top adviser is also calling for the United States to launch a cruise missile attack on Syria.\\nThe American people are fed up with war, but a concerted effort is being made through fearmongering, propaganda, and lies to prepare our country for a dangerous confrontation, with Russia in Syria.\\nThe demonization of Russia is a calculated plan to resurrect a r aison d\\x92ętre for stone-cold warriors trying to escape from the dustbin of history by evoking the specter of Russian world domination.\\nIt\\x92s infectious. Earlier this year the BBC broadcast a fictional show that contemplated WWIII, beginning with a Russian invasion of Latvia (where 26 percent of the population is ethnic Russian and 34 percent of Latvians speak Russian at home).\\nThe imaginary WWIII scenario conjures Russia\\x92s targeting London for a nuclear strike. No wonder that by the summer of 2016 a poll showed two-thirds of UK citizens approved the new British PM\\x92s launching a nuclear strike in retaliation. So much for learning the lessons detailed in the Chilcot report.\\nAs this year\\x92s presidential election comes to a conclusion, the Washington ideologues are regurgitating the same bipartisan consensus that has kept America at war since 9/11 and made the world a decidedly more dangerous place.\\nThe DC think tanks provide cover for the political establishment, a political safety net, with a fictive analytical framework providing a moral rationale for intervention, capitol casuistry. I\\x92m fed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other people\\x92s lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country.\\nAny report advocating war that comes from any alleged think tank ought to be accompanied by a list of the think tank\\x92s sponsors and donors and a statement of the lobbying connections of the report\\x92s authors.\\nIt is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes.\\nIt is also time for a new peace movement in America, one that includes progressives and libertarians alike, both in and out of Congress, to organize on campuses, in cities, and towns across America, to serve as an effective counterbalance to the Demuplican war party, its think tanks, and its media cheerleaders. The work begins now, not after the Inauguration. We must not accept war as inevitable, and those leaders who would lead us in that direction, whether in Congress or the White House, must face visible opposition.\\nDennis Kucinich, a former Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, represented Ohio\\'s 10th District from 1997 to 2013.

       " ['Politicisation of Terrorism at the BRICS Summit | New Eastern Outlook',\n",
       "  'Region: Southern Asia The fight against terrorism is increasingly a key issue for all countries, and it is quite natural that it has drawn the attention of the participants of the 8th BRICS summit. However, India has a particular interest in focusing attention on it after terrorists from the radical group “Jaish-e-Mohammed” (“Army of Mohammed”) committed attacks on the Indian infantry battalion garrison near the town of Uri, 10 km from the Line of Control in Kashmir on September 18th. India held Pakistan responsible for the deaths of 18 Indian soldiers, and claimed that it supports these terrorists. On Twitter, Rajnath Singh, the Home Minister, described the attack as a cross-border invasion of militants trained and armed by Pakistan, and called it a “terrorist state.” Speaking at the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, the representative of India raised the issue of Pakistan’s support for cross-border terrorism, which has both a regional and global impact. India responded to the terrorist attack with surgical strikes on their bases in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir, which destroyed seven militant hideouts and killed more than 35 extremists. Despite protests from Pakistan, the world community has not condemned India’s actions. Relations between the two countries have entered a new round of confrontation that has also involved the BRICS countries. The problem of terrorism brought up by Narendra Modi at the summit (which was condemned by Pakistan) turned out not to have such a simple solution as it affects the interests of other members of the organization, especially Russia and China. At the opening of the meeting, N. Modi said: “In our region, terrorism poses a grave threat to peace, security and development. Tragically the mothership of terrorism is a country in India’s neighbourhood. Terror modules around the world are linked to this mothership. BRICS must speak in one voice against this threat.” Earlier at the G20 meeting on September 5th, N. Modi called for the isolation and punishment of those who sponsor or support terrorism. Thus, when discussing the issue of terrorism, the BRICS countries de facto had to answer the question of who they support more: \\xadIndia or Pakistan in their struggle for leadership in South Asia. In spite of the Russia-Pakistan joint military exercises carried out shortly before the summit, N. Modi decided not only not to focus attention on this issue but put every effort into winning the support of Russia, which he called “old friend” (in Russian), and expressed his appreciation for the unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist attack on an army garrison in Uri. In the Joint Statement issued following the visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to the Republic of India on October 15, 2016, the parties stressed the need to avoid the emergence of ‘safe havens’ for terrorists. Although the wording is rather vague and does not point directly to Pakistan as a ‘safe haven’ for terrorists, India was satisfied with it. While answering the journalists’ questions about military ties between Russia and Pakistan, the Deputy Foreign Minister of India Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that Russia would not do anything that could harm India’s interests. There is full understanding between Russia and India. At the summit, this was actually proved by the strengthening of the military-technical and economic cooperation between the two countries. As for China, its position regarding the involvement of Pakistan in the terrorist attack to India, was announced even earlier, when it blocked the Indian proposal to include Masood Azhar, the leader of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, into the list of international terrorists, declared illegal by the UN. India considers him responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in the country including the attack of December 13, 2001 on the Parliament and of January 2, 2016 on the Pathankot Air Force Station. The issue, of course, is not about Masood Azhar. As it was officially announced, “China opposes all forms of terrorism. Double standards in combating terrorism should be abandoned. However, it is also unacceptable to use the fight against terrorism as a pretext for political purposes.” China is governed by purely pragmatic economic and political considerations underlying its rapprochement with Pakistan. Politically, China wants to use Pakistan as a geopolitical player, able to resist the growing influence of India in South Asia, and as a link with the Islamic world. Expansion of military cooperation between India and the United States also causes concern among the Chinese leadership as it could adversely affect China’s plans in the Indian Ocean. In addition to the geopolitical rivalry between China and India, the fact that India provides protection to the Dalai Lama is a further irritant to their relations. Pakistan is also of economic interest to China in terms of the realisation of its ambitious initiative, “One Belt, One Road”. Although N. Modi tried to persuade Xi Jinping that India and China, as ‘victims of terrorism’, should not conduct different approaches to counter it; the Chinese leader acknowledged the growing threat of terrorism and condemned all its forms in his 10-minute speech at the summit, however he limited himself to stating the need to strengthen dialogue on security and partnership in the region. China’s position on Masood Azhar remained unchanged. India’s attempts to politicise the issue of terrorism at the BRICS summit in order to isolate Pakistan politically as a country “which provides havens for terrorists and arms them” failed. The leaders of the five countries reasonably remained neutral and demonstrated political foresight, in order not to aggravate the situation in South Asia which may be used by the terrorists to enhance their activities.

       " ['How Salon Gets Away with Deceiving Its Readers | OffGuardian',\n",
       "  'written by Admin by Eric Zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org Before I start this condemnation of lies from ‘liberal’ ‘news’ media, I should indicate that I am a former lifelong Democrat who left the Party over the corruption of the Obama Administration when the corruption became capped by their Democratic National Committee using many devices to steal the Presidential nomination away from Bernie Sanders, to hand it to Obama’s chosen successor Hillary Clinton, whom Obama expected would complete his pro-Wall-Street legacy by passing into law some version of his trade treaties and by Hillary’s conquering Russia, the latter of which goal was a U.S. government project that had actually started in secret on the night of 24 February 1990 when the then-President George Herbert Walker Bush initiated what has since become a ceaseless behind-the-scenes U.S. government program to expand NATO right up to Russia’s borders and ultimately to conquer Russia itself. Though the Cold War ended authentically on Russia’s side in 1991, it never really did end on the U.S. side (that was just a lie) — and Obama-Clinton were hoping soon to culminate the U.S. aristocracy’s conquest of Russia. I remain a committed progressive journalist but am no longer committed to any political party, because now both of the major political parties are vile and no third party in a Presidential system of government stands a realistic chance of controlling either the Executive branch or the Legislative branch of government — its only function is to serve as “spoiler” for one or the other of the two. So: I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican, nor a supporter of some ‘third’ Party, but remain unchanged throughout, consistently a progressive, which means totally dedicated to truth and against lies (such as dominate all forms of conservatism). My criticisms of ‘news’media reflect that, no political-party orientation. \\nOn November 9th, Salon’s reporter Brendan Gauthier headlined Salon’s top-of-homepage headline of the day, “In Donald Trump’s cabinet from hell, corporatism and cronyism run rampant — and Sarah Palin may be there, too” and reported what was at the time speculation that was sourced to an NBC news report, titled “Gingrich, Giuliani, Priebus Eyed for Top Jobs in Trump White House: Sources” , which stated that: \\nAmong the names being considered, according to conversations with three campaign advisers who requested anonymity to speak freely: Rudy Giuliani for attorney general, Newt Gingrich for secretary of state, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn for defense secretary or national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, and Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg for commerce secretary. \\nTrump himself has not taken an active part in transition efforts, in part out of superstition: He fears too much planning before a victory might jinx the campaign. In 2012, he was shocked to read detailed stories on Mitt Romney’s preparations for the White House long before election day… \\nAlabama Senator Jeff Sessions, a loyal supporter, has taken a major role managing the transition effort, especially as the official transition chief, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, has drifted from the campaign… \\nAsked for comment on the above names floated for cabinet posts, Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks replied by e-mail that “none of this is accurate.” \\nGauthier added nothing substantial to that NBC information (of which, maybe, “none of this is accurate”) except to say such uninformative things as that Gingrich “proved himself a rabid Trump surrogate” and as that Giuliani “has been a tireless, if controversial, surrogate for Trump on the trail and in the media.” But in one instance Gauthier linked to a New York Post op-ed by Michael Flynn as being his source by which to allege regarding: “ Department of Defense Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn: Trump’s national security adviser was fired from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, which he attributed to his hawkishness.” \\nThat statement about Flynn is outright false. Here is all that Flynn’s op-ed — Gauthier’s cited source — actually said concerning his having been fired by Obama: \\nTwo years ago, I was called into a meeting with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence, and after some “niceties,” I was told by the USDI that I was being let go from DIA. It was definitely an uncomfortable moment (I suspect more for them than me). \\nI asked the DNI (Gen. James Clapper) if my leadership of the agency was in question and he said it was not; had it been, he said, they would have relieved me on the spot. \\nI knew then it had more to do with the stand I took on radical Islamism and the expansion of al Qaeda and its associated movements. I felt the intel system was way too politicized, especially in the Defense Department… \\nI was pissed but knew that I had maintained my integrity and was determined in the few months I had left to continue the changes I was instituting and to keep beating the drum about the vicious enemy we were facing (still are)… \\nWe’re in a global war, facing an enemy alliance that … picks up radical Muslim countries and organizations such as Iran, al Qaeda, the Taliban and Islamic State. \\nThat’s a formidable coalition, and nobody should be shocked to discover that we are losing the war. \\nThere was no indication whatsoever in the article, that Flynn had been fired on account of any “hawkishness.” That allegation by Salon was simply fabricated. \\nThe reality about Flynn’s firing was the exact opposite: he was too ‘dovish’ to suit the neoconservative Barack Obama, who was now demanding that all of his top military generals support his goal of going to war against Russia. Flynn objected to that by saying that only one war at a time makes any sense, and that this war must be the defeat of jihadists, nothing else — certainly not a war against the other nuclear superpower. \\nRather than Flynn’s support of Trump being a reflection of their shared ‘hawkishness’, it reflects their strong belief that the view that Barack Obama holds and that Hillary Clinton holds even more strongly — that the war against jihadists must be subordinated to the war against Russia — is a totally upside-down view of the priorities, and that instead of the U.S. supporting jihadists who are warring against Russia and its allies, the U.S. ought to be supporting Russia and its allies who are warring against jihadists. \\nIf Salon wants to support the Obama-Clinton view and oppose the Trump view on the basis of truthful assertions, then that’s journalism and it is not mere political propaganda. \\nBut if Salon wants to deceive its readers into holding the political viewpoint that they hold, then what else is there to call Salon but a propaganda-site?

       " ['Veterans Heading to Standing Rock to Defend DAPL Protesters from Cops',\n",
       "  \"Pin 1 \\n( ANTIMEDIA ) As protesters continue to stand against the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, facing off against heavily militarized police and their water cannons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and tasers, they have gained broad support. Celebrities and millions of social media users have raised awareness about the situation in North Dakota, and now, the “water protectors” have earned support from another group: veterans. \\nAccording to an article published by Business Insider that first appeared in Task and Purpose , a military-oriented news and culture site, two veterans are leading the charge in a show of dissent against the increasingly aggressive police. In the last several months, tensions have escalated as Natives and their allies have blocked the pipeline’s construction, citing fears surrounding water will be endangered and sacred burial sites will be destroyed (not to mention the fact their lands were forcibly stolen by the U.S. government over a century ago). \\n“This country is repressing our people, ” says Michael A. Wood Jr., a Marine Corps veteran who recently retired from the Baltimore police force to work toward reforming law enforcement. “ If we’re going to be heroes, if we’re really going to be those veterans that this country praises, well, then we need to do the things that we actually said we’re going to do when we took the oath to defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic ,” he asserted about his plans to go to Standing Rock. \\nWoods Jr. is joined by Wes Clark Jr. Clark Jr. is the son of General Wesley Clark, the famous military leader who once warned that shortly after 9/11, the government had its eyes on Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran. Clark would later attempt to distance himself from those statements but still managed to convince his son, a member of the Army at the time, to stay away from Iraq. \\n“ I was like, ‘I’m going back in. I’m going to go in there and fuck people up ,’” Clark Jr. recalls of his desire to fight for the military after 9/11. He later changed his mind after his father warned him, as Task and Purpose summarized, “ that as a soldier he would be fighting a war that had nothing to do with defeating al Qaeda. ” \\nNow, Wood Jr. and Clark Jr. are attempting to organize a mass, nonviolent protest against police action in North Dakota. Just this past weekend, a female protester was hit with a concussion grenade, causing severe damage to her arm and requiring surgery. \\nOther have been tear gassed, tased, beaten, and shot with rubber bullets. Anti-Media journalist Derrick Broze was tased by law enforcement immediately after he declared he was a member of the media. Another journalist was shot with a rubber bullet while standing away from a gathering of protesters as she interviewed an attendee. \\nPolice have made over 470 arrests since August, and the Indigenous Environmental Network claims 167 people were injured just this past Sunday when police deployed water cannons in freezing weather. Sign up for the free Anti-Media newsletter the establishment doesn't want you to receive \\nClark, a contributor to the Young Turks, explained that aside from the flagrant violations protesters are subject to in North Dakota, Natives are especially deserving of veteran support: \\n“ First Americans have served in the Unites States Military, defending the soil of our homelands, at a greater percentage than any other group of Americans. There is no other people more deserving of veteran support ,” he said. \\nAccording to a Facebook event the two men created called “Veterans Stand for Standing Rock,” those who join the effort will arrive at the protest site on December 4, where they will stay until December 7. \\nThe event description reads: \\n“ Come to Standing Rock Indian Reservation and hold the line with Wes Clark jr, Michael Wood Jr, Tulsi Gabbard and hundreds of other veterans in support of the Sioux nation against the DAPL pipeline. Bring Body armor, gas masks, earplugs AND shooting mufflers (we may be facing a sound cannon) but no drugs, alcohol or weapons . ” \\nClark Jr. was clear he was not looking for violence and that the protest would be unarmed. \\n“ We’re not going out there to get in a fight with anyone, ” he said. “ They can feel free to beat us up, but we’re 100% nonviolence .” \\nAs Task and Purpose explained: \\n“ With an eye toward the media, old military uniforms will be donned so that if the veterans are brutalized by the police, they are brutalized not as ordinary citizens, but as people who once served the government they are protesting against. ” \\nThe event page makes it clear that the group will not tolerate “ hate, violence or divisive behavior of any kind .” \\n“ We’re doing this to support our country ,” they advise, “ so let’s do it with honor, working together. We can stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. If not us, who? If not now, when? ” \\nOver 250 veterans have already committed, but organizers hope to have a group of 500 or more by the time they head to Standing Rock. \\nOnce there, the veterans intend to engage in a traditional native healing ceremony with protesters, with whom they have been coordinating, according to the veterans. Then, protective gear like gas masks and body armor will be issued to anyone who needs it. The soldiers will march to bagpipes and Sioux war songs as they head to the banks of the Missouri River to meet police. \\n“ Then, the veterans and their allies — or at least the ones who are brave enough — will lock arms and cross the river in a ‘massive line’ for their ‘first encounter’ with the ‘opposing forces. ’” \\nThough the veterans have adopted a strict policy of nonviolence, they refuse to back down and apparently hope to use their military status to spotlight the egregious behavior of the police. \\n“ We’ll have those people who will recognize that they’re not willing to take a bullet, and those who recognize that they are ,” says Wood Jr. “ It’s okay if some of them step back, but Wes and I have no intention of doing so .” \\nVeterans Stand for Standing Rock is accepting donations to cover food, transportation, and supplies for those who travel to North Dakota.

       "  ' A View of the Syrian War From the Golan Heights One Syrian lieutenant described to me how he directed his artillery fire onto an Israeli jeep in the Jabhat al-Nusra occupied town of Al-Hamidiya inside Syria and destroyed it. The jeep might have been a gift or borrowed from Israel\\nBy Robert Fisk\\nNovember 10, 2016 \" Information Clearing House \" - \" The Independent \" - From Colonel Saleh\\x92s forward position on his front line north of Quneitra, he has a unique and exclusive view of the Syrian war. To his west and south is a vast area of his country which is occupied by Jabhat al-Nusra Islamist fighters \\x96 their earthen ramparts and supply roads are scarcely half a mile away. Then, another couple of miles away, Israeli soldiers are inside their concrete positions on the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, above the old and Nusra-held Syrian city of Quneitra.\\n\\x93You see that mosque over there, just to the right of the water tower?\\x94 the colonel asks. \\x93Well, Nusra is there. And you see the triangular hill beyond? The Israelis are there.\\x94 It\\x92s what you call a politically intriguing battlefield \\x96 yes, shells do come whizzing in towards the Syrians from Nusra and also from the Israelis. The Syrians concentrate their fire on Nusra but Nusra\\x92s casualties are often taken through the Israeli lines for hospital treatment in Haifa.\\nSo whose side is Israel on? Baath City is a concrete conurbation created back in pre-civil war days to defy the vandalisation of the old Quenitra. It was occupied by the Israeli army during the 1973 Middle East war and then \\x96 before they abandoned it under the Kissinger agreement \\x96 totally destroyed with explosives by Israeli troops. Nusra now occupy these 43-year old ruins. As for Baath City, its university, banks, fire station, schools, police force and hospitals are defiantly maintained by the Syrians under the eyes of their two enemies: the Nusra Islamists and the Israelis.\\nAccording to the Syrian army in Baath City \\x96 their forward lines and tanks are positioned in unfinished apartment blocks on the edge of the town \\x96 their intelligence department\\x92s Hebrew speakers constantly monitor conversations between the Israelis and between Israeli and Nusra fighters. They know \\x96 and the Israelis have made no secret of the fact \\x96 that wounded Nusrah fighters are taken to Haifa for hospital treatment. On one occasion, a Nusrah man travelling in an Israeli ambulance on the Golan was dragged from the vehicle and lynched by a crowd of enraged Druze men who are largely loyal to the Syrian government and regard Nusrah as their mortal enemies. Reports of the man\\x92s murder highlighted the highly ambiguous relationship between Israel and the Islamists, whose name-changing cannot conceal their al-Qaeda roots.\\nDruze towns inside Syria and close to Baath City have taken the side of the regime \\x96 this does not apply to other Druze areas \\x96 but it makes the geography of the front line here all the more surreal. One Syrian lieutenant described to me how he directed his artillery fire onto an Israeli jeep in the Nusra-occupied town of Al-Hamidiya inside Syria and destroyed it. The jeep might have been a gift or borrowed from Israel \\x96 whether there were any Israeli personnel inside it if it was hit is another matter. The Syrians, however, also say that Israeli bulldozers were used to build a new supply route for Nusrah between Quneitra and Golan \\x96 again, inside Syria\\x92s frontiers.\\nAll of which raises a compelling question. The Nusra-controlled territory between the Syrians and the Israeli lines on Golan \\x96 and other Islamist groups and a few remnants of the old \\x93Free Syrian Army\\x94 allied to them in this location \\x96 stretches all the way south to the edge of the Syrian city of Deraa and right down to the Jordanian frontier. And beyond that frontier is the so-called \\x93Military Operations Centre\\x94 \\x96 the \\x93MOC\\x94 of which both the Islamists and the Syrian army refer \\x96 where Western intelligence officers maintain a liaison and weapons supply depot for the anti-government Syrian forces.\\nSo what is the relationship between the MOC and its Western backers \\x96 who maintain contact with Nusra \\x96 and the Israelis who treat Nusra\\x92s wounded in their hospitals? The Jordanian border and the Israeli lines on Golan are at their most only about 70 miles apart and opposition fighters hold all the land in between.\\nLittered around the front lines outside Baath City are the wreckage of past battles and the abandoned UN posts from which Filipino UN soldiers were kidnapped en masse more than a year ago; the Syrian army now occupies several of these positions, the UN logo still painted on the walls although several of the \\x93igloo\\x94-type UN accommodation huts have migrated to Syrian compounds in the rear lines. The UN force on Golan now operates only inside Israeli-occupied territory.\\nOnly a few hundred yards away from Nusra-held territory, we found Abu Hashem, a farmer who fled from his village, now held by the Islamists, living today in family property close to one of the old UN posts. He fed us tea and coffee and walnuts from his orchard. His wife and six children now exist in this unfinished, cold house along with a small library of books \\x96 the speeches of Imam Ali (the \\x93Najul Blagha\\x94) and a collection of medical books of Aleppo herbal cures for headaches and kidney infection, published in Beirut. He says the people in his Nusra-occupied village are divided. Some are sympathetic towards the Islamists \\x96 they are not fighters \\x96 while others are sometimes permitted by Nusrah to cross the front lines for treatment in Syrian government hospitals. They are Bedouins and farmers, the unsettled and the landowners, always prey to the wolves of civil war insurgents.\\nColonel Saleh, who is 50 years old, has been guarding his echoing and weed-strewn apartment blocks on the edge of Baath City for three years, noting wearily that the Israelis attack his army but never attack Nusra who \\x96 being al-Qaeda \\x96 might logically have earned Israel\\x92s enmity. But no. \\x93I know every stone here,\\x94 the colonel says. \\x93I can see if a rock or a vehicle has moved across the fields in front of us \\x96 and I can immediately see if one vehicle has become two vehicles. We know when they are going to attack \\x96 they always precede their offensives with a big artillery and mortar barrage.\\x94\\nSometimes the voices of Nusra men shout insults at the Syrians on their own radio sets, calling them \\x93kafirs\\x94 \\x96 \\x91\\x93infidels\\x94 or \\x93unbelievers\\x94. \\x93If I am in a good mood, I invite them for coffee,\\x94 Colonel Saleh says. \\x93If I\\x92m in a bad mood, I am silent. Their accents are very similar to the Jordanians. They come from the south of Deraa, along the Jordanian border.\\x94\\nAs we spoke, further down the line, the Syrians and Nusra were fighting with tanks, artillery and mortars. The Syrians claimed that their enemies arrived in several directions in a convoy of at least 13 vehicles. They spoke, too, of a Nusra female officer called Souad al-Qatahani (nicknamed \\x93Al-Nood\\x94), the 30-year-old sister of a Nusrah general called Qais al-Omani who commanded 1,200 fighters. She was, they pointed out rather remarkably, a former first lieutenant in their own Syrian government army.\\nAnd one further feature that the Syrians have noted about their enemies outside Baath City. Whenever Nusra fire a missile, they have to take a photograph of the rocket leaving its launcher \\x96 presumably to prove to their suppliers that they have not sold the weapon to someone else. Trust, as usual in the Syrian war, is in short supply.'],\n",

This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don’t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. \\nCongress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: \\n1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. \\n2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. \\n3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn’t Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. TRENDING ON 100% Fed Up '],\n",

       "  'This post was originally published on this site \\n© Mikhail Metzel/TASS \\nKIEV, November 22. /TASS/. The Russian servicemen detained on the border with Crimea are the former servicemen of Ukraine’s army accused of breaking the military oath, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry spokesman on the Donbass military operation Alexander Motuzyanik said on Tuesday. \\n“We don’t know on what purpose these persons crossed the administrative border. They were detained on the territory controlled by Ukraine and it was found out that these are the former servicemen of Ukraine’s Armed Forces who failed to comply with the respective directive and did not leave Crimea,” the spokesman said. \\n“So they broke the military oath and there are the respective criminal proceedings against them,” he said, adding that the detention took place as part of Ukraine’s current legislation. \\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said late on Monday that the Ukrainian Security Service officers had illegally detained Russian contract servicemen in Crimea at about 13:00 Moscow time (10:00 GMT) on November 20 and took them to Ukraine’s Nikolayev Region. \\nThe ministry said further that according to available data, the Ukrainian special services were attempting to fabricate a criminal case against Alexander Baranov and Maxim Odintsov for allegedly committed crimes against Ukraine. \\nRussia’s Defense Ministry does not rule out that psychological and physical pressure will be exerted on the Russian servicemen to obtain necessary confessionary evidence from them. \\nThis information was confirmed earlier on Tuesday by a representative of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. “Officers of the Ukrainian Security Service used substitute persons to entice warrant officer Maxim Odintsov and contract service junior sergeant Alexander Baranov into the Dzhankoi checkpoint allegedly for giving them attested documents of receiving higher education at Ukrainian higher educational institutions,” the fleet’s representative said. \\nShortly after Odintsov and Baranov left Russia’s territory, the servicemen were detained by representatives of the Ukrainian Security Service and brought to Ukraine’s Nikolayev Region, he added. \\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has come up with a statement that Ukrainian special services have made a provocation against Russian citizens on the territory of Russia by abducting two servicemen in Crimea.”We believe this was an unlawful provocation made by Ukraine’s special services on the territory of Russia against Russian citizens.

       " ['The Euro Is Murdering Europe     : Information',\n",
       "  ' The Euro Is Murdering Europe\\nBy F. William Engdahl\\nNovember 13, \" NEO \" - The Euro is murdering the nations and economies of the EU quite literally. Since the fixed currency regime came into effect, replacing national currencies in transactions in 2002, the fixed exchange rate regime has devastated industry in the periphery states of the 19 Euro members while giving disproportionate benefit to Germany. The consequence has been a little-noted industrial contraction and lack of possibility to deal with resulting banking crises. The Euro is a monetarist disaster and the EU dissolution is now pre-programmed as just one consequence.\\nThose of you familiar with my thoughts on the economy will know I feel the entire concept of globalization, a term which was popularized under the presidency of Bill Clinton to glamorize the corporativist agenda that had just come into being with creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994, is fundamentally a destructive rigged game of the few hundred or so giant \\x93global players. Globalization destroys nations to advance the agenda of a few hundred giant, unregulated multinationals. It\\x92s based on a disproven theory put forward in the 18 th Century by English free trade proponent David Ricardo, known as the Theory of Comparative Advantage, used by Washington to justify removing any and all national trade protectionism in order to benefit the most powerful \\x93Global Players,\\x94 mostly US-based.\\nThe faltering US project known as Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership or the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is little more than Mussolini on steroids. The most powerful few hundred corporations will formally stand above national law if we are foolish enough to elect corrupt politicians that will endorse such nonsense. Yet few have really looked closely at the effect that surrender of currency sovereignty under the Euro regime is having.\\nCollapse of Industry\\nThe nations of what today is misleadingly known as the European Union follow a concept ratified by a then-far-smaller number of European members\\x96twelve versus 28 states today\\x96of what had been the European Economic Community (EEC). A European version of giganto-mania appeared during the EEC Commission presidency of French globalist politician Jacques Delors when he unveiled what was called the Single European Act in February 1986.\\nDelors overturned the principle established by France\\x92s Charles de Gaulle, the principle which de Gaulle referred to as \\x93Europe of the Fatherlands.\\x94 De Gaulle\\x92s concept of the European Economic Community\\x96then six nations including France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux three\\x96was one in which there would be periodical meetings of the premiers of the six Common Market nations. There, with elected heads of states, policies would be formulated and decisions made. An assembly elected from members of national parliaments would review the actions of the ministers. De Gaulle viewed the Brussels EEC bureaucracy as a purely technical administrative body, subordinate to national governments. Cooperation should be based on the \\x93reality\\x94 of state sovereignty. Supranational acquisition of power over individual nations of the EEC was anathema for de Gaulle, rightly so. As with individuals so with nations\\x97autonomy is basic and borders do matter.\\nDelors\\x92 Single Act proposed to overturn that Europe of the Fatherlands through radical reforms to the EEC aimed at the destructive idea that the diverse nations, with diverse histories, cultures and diverse languages, could dissolve borders and become a kind of ersatz United States of Europe, run top down by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. It in essence is a Mussolini-style corporativist or fascist vision of a non-democratic, non-responsible European bureaucracy controlling populations arbitrarily, answerable only to corporate influence, pressure, corruption.\\nIt was an agenda developed by the largest multinationals of Europe, whose lobby organization was the European Roundtable of Industrialists (ERT), the influential lobby group of Europe\\x92s major multinationals (by personal invitation only) such as Swiss-based Nestle, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Vodafone, BASF, Deutsche Telekom, ThyssenKrupp, Siemens and other giant European multinationals. The ERT, not surprisingly, is the major lobby in Brussels pushing adoption of the TIPP trade deal with Washington .\\nThe ERT was a major driver for the 1986 Delors Single Act proposals that led to the Frankenstein Monster called the European Union. The idea of the EU is creation of a top-down central unelected political authority that would decide the future of Europe without democratic checks and balances, at heart a truly feudal notion.\\nThe concept of a single United States of Europe, dissolving national identities that went back more than a thousand years or more, can be traced back to the 1950\\x92s when the Bilderberg Meeting of 1955 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany, first discussed the creation out of the six member nations of the European Coal and Steel Community of \\x93a common currency, and this necessarily implied the creation of a central political authority .\\x94 De Gaulle was not present.\\nThe project to create a monetary union was unveiled at a 1992 EEC conference in Maastricht, Holland following the unification of Germany. France and Italy, backed by Margaret Thatcher\\x92s Britain, forced it through over German misgivings in order to \\x93contain the power of a unified Germany.\\x94 British Tory press railed against Germany as an emerging \\x93Fourth Reich,\\x94 conquering Europe economically, not militarily. Ironically, this is what has very much de facto emerged from the structures of the Euro today. Because of the Euro, Germany economically dominates the entire 19 Eurozone countries.\\nThe problem with the creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) prescribed in Maastricht Treaty is that the single currency and the \\x93independent\\x94 European Central Bank were launched without being tied to a political single legal entity, a genuine United States of Europe. The Euro and the European Central Bank is a supranational creation without answerability to anyone. It was done in absence of a genuine organic political union such as that created when 13 states, with common English language and following a commonly-fought war of independence from Great Britain, created and adopted the Constitution of the United States of America. In 1788 the delegates from the 13 states agreed to establish a republican form of government grounded in representing the people in the states, with separation of powers between the legislative, judicial and executive branches. Not so the EMU.\\nThe EU bureaucrats have a cute name for this disconnect between unelected central bank officials of the ECB controlling the economic destiny of the 19 member states with 340 million citizens of the so-called Eurozone. They call it the \\x93democratic deficit.\\x94 That deficit has grown gargantuan since the 2008 global financial and banking crisis and the emergence of the not-sovereign European Central Bank.\\nCollapse of Industry\\nThe creation of the Euro single currency since 1992 has put the Euro member states into an economic strait-jacket. The currency value cannot be changed to boost national exports during economic downturns such as that experienced since 2008. The result has been that the largest industrial power in the Eurozone, Germany, has benefited from the stable euro while weaker economies on the periphery of the EU, including most notably, France, have endured catastrophic consequences to the rigid Euro rate.\\nIn a new report, the Dutch think-tank, Gefira Foundation, notes that French industry has been contracting since the adoption of the euro. \\x93It was not able to recover after either of the 2001 or 2008 crises because the euro, a currency stronger than the French franc would be, has become a burden to France\\x92s economy. The floating exchange rate works like an indicator of the strength of the economy and like an automatic stabilizer. A weaker currency helps to regain competitiveness during a crisis, while a stronger currency supports consumption of foreign goods .\\x94\\nThe study notes that because of this currency strait-jacket, ECB\\x92s policy has created a Euro too high versus other major currencies to enable France to maintain exports since the economic downturn of 2001. The Euro has led to increased imports into France and because France had no exchange rate flexibility, her industry \\x93could not regain international competitiveness in the world\\x92s market after the 2001 crisis, so its industry has been slowly dying ever since.\\x94 They lost the economic stabilizing tool of a floating exchange rate .\\nToday, according to the Eurostat, industry makes up 14.1% of the French total gross value added. In 1995 it was 19.2%. In Germany it is 25.9%. Most striking has been the collapse of a once-vibrant French car industry. Despite the fact that world car production almost doubled from 1997 to 2015 from 53 million to 90 million vehicles annually, and while Germany increased its car production by 20% from 5 to 6 million, from the time France joined the Euro in 2002, French car production almost halved from nearly 4 million to less than 2 million .\\nEuro Bail-in Laws\\nThe same Euro strait-jacket is preventing a serious reorganization of troubled banks across the Eurozone since the 2008 crisis. The creation of the supra-national, non-sovereign European central Bank has made it impossible for member countries of the Eurozone to resolve their banking problems created during the excesses of the pre-2008 period. The case of Italy with its request to make a state bailout of its third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi, is exemplary. Though draconian layoffs and closings have for the moment eased panic, Brussels refused to permit a $5 billion Italian state rescue of the bank, instead demanding the bank revert to a new EU banking law called \\x93Bail in.\\x94 While they may not yet dare to implement bail-in just yet in Italy, it is EU law and will certainly be the instrument of choice by the unelected Eurogroup when the next banking crisis hits.\\nBail-in, while it sounds better than taxpayer bailout, actually requires that a bank\\x92s depositors be robbed of their deposits to \\x93rescue\\x94 a failed bank, if Brussels or the unelected Eurogroup decides such a bail-in of deposits is needed after bank bond holders and stock holders and creditors have not been able to meet the losses. This bail-in confiscation was applied in Cyprus banks in 2013 by the EU. Depositors there with over \\x80100,000 either lost 40% of their money .\\nIf you are a depositor in, say, Deutsche Bank, and the stock shares are tanking, as they have been, and legal troubles threaten their existence, and the German government refuses to talk bailout, but rather leaves the bank to potential bail-in, you can be sure every depositor with an account over \\x80100,000 will begin to look to other banks, worsening the crisis for Deutsche Bank. Then all other remaining depositors would be vulnerable to bail-in as was initially proposed by the Eurogroup for Cyprus banks.\\nSurrender of monetary sovereignty\\nUnder the Euro and the rules of Eurogroup and ECB, decisions are no longer sovereign but central, taken by not-democratically appointed faceless bureaucrats like Holland Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, President of Eurogroup. During the Cyprus bank crisis Dijsselbloem proposed confiscating all depositor money, big or small, to recapitalize the banks. He was forced to back down at the last minute, but it shows what is possible in the coming EU bank crisis that is pre-programmed by the defective Euro institution and its fatally flawed ECB.\\nUnder current Eurozone rules, effective January, 2016, EU national governments are prohibited from taxpayer rescue of their banks, preventing orderly resolution of bank liquidity problems until too late. Germany has adopted a bank bail-in law as have other EU governments. The new bail-in rules are the result of a bureaucratic directive from the unelected, faceless bureaucrats of the EU Commission known as the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (\\x93 BRRD \\x94).\\nIn 1992 when Swedish banks went into insolvency as a real estate bubble popped, the state stepped in with Securum, a bad-bank/good bank rescue. The bankrupt banks were temporarily nationalized. Non-performing real estate loans in billions were put into the state corporation, Securum, the so-called bad bank. The risk-addicted bank directors were dismissed. The nationalized banks, minus bad loans, were allowed, under state management, to resume lending and return to profit before being reprivatized as the economy improved. The non-performing real estate became again profitable as the economy recovered over several years, and after five years the state could sell the assets for a total net profit and liquidate Securum . Taxpayers were not burdened.\\nECB Prevents Bank Resolutions\\nNow, as the EU faces a new round of bank solvency crises with banks like Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and major banks across the Eurozone facing new capital crises, because the EU lacks a central taxation power, no flexible tax-payer or bank nationalization is possible. New national bank rules adjusted to local circumstances are not possible. Measures to give troubled banks time such as allowing a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and repossessions if people fall behind on their payments, outsourcing national electronic payment system to commercial banks, are not possible.\\nThe EuroZone has no central fiscal authority, so such solutions cannot be implemented. Banking system problems are only being solved by monetary authorities, by the insane ECB policy of negative interest rates, so-called Quantitative Easing where the ECB buys endless billions of Euros in dodgy corporate and state debt with no end in sight, and in the process making insurance companies and pension funds insolvent.\\nThe answer is definitely not that proposed by the kleptocratic George Soros and others, namely to give the unelected Brussels super-state the central fiscal power to issue Brussels Euro bonds. The only possible solution short of destroying the economies of the entire Eurozone in the coming next European bank solvency crisis, is to dismantle the Frankenstein Monster called the European Monetary Union with its ECB and common currency.\\nThe individual countries in the 19 country Euro Zone do not form what economists call an \\x93optimum currency area,\\x94 never did. The economic problems of a Greece or Italy or even France are vastly different from those of Germany, or of Portugal or Spain.\\nIn 1997 before his death, one of my least-favorite economists, Milton Friedman, stated, \\x93Europe exemplifies a situation unfavorable to a common currency. It is composed of separate nations, speaking different languages, with different customs, and having citizens feeling far greater loyalty and attachment to their own country than to a common market or to the idea of Europe.\\x94 On that, I have to say, he was right. It\\x92s even more so the case today. The Euro and its European Central Bank are murdering Europe as effectively as the Second World War did, only without the bombs and rubble.\\nF.
